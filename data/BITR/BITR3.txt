AB Fire is considered the main cause for the patchy distribution of high-montane tropical forests growing below the upper limit of tree growth, but there are little quantitative data on the impacts of burning on the respective tree populations. This study compares adult tree survival as well as sapling (0.05-1.3 m) and seedling (< 0.05 m) recruitment of Polylepis incana, and the coexisting Gynoxis acostae in burned and unburned forest stands in the Paramo de Guamani, central Ecuador. In P. incana, adult survival after burning was low, whereas all G. acostae individuals survived through resprouting. Two years after fire, the density of P incana seedlings and saplings was higher than that of G. acostae, but still not sufficient for forest recovery. A sowing experiment revealed a significantly lower seedling emergence of both species in the burned than in the unburned plots. Seedling emergence was comparable to laboratory studies performed under optimal conditions, suggesting there was no evidence for climate constraining emergence at the given altitude. Interactions between seedling survival and burning for P incana indicate higher seedling survival after burning, which could not be shown for G. acostae. Our data imply that single fire events strongly decrease adult and seedling population sizes in P incana and thus may be the main reason for the discontinuous forest distribution below the upper distribution limit of the species. In contrast, the high resprouting potential of G. acostae explains its relatively high percentage in the remaining Ecuadorian P incana stands.

AB We investigated the remarkable roosting behavior of Docidocercus gigliotosi, an understory pseudophylline katydid in the lowland forests of Panama. The insects used a spiny terrestrial bromeliad, Aechmea magdalenae, as a daytime shelter and were significantly more frequently found in those plants, which had been: (1) higher; (2) of better quality; (3) closer to 'night time walkways' into the canopy; and (4) showed a better central tube condition. The katydids demonstrated strong site fidelity; returning to the same plants for up to 3 wk. Such a choice may provide sufficient protection against some predators and serve as a suitable shelter for the offspring.

AB Mutualisms involve the exchange of resources and these resources attract exploiters and predators. Because predators may have a stronger effect either on mutualists or on exploiters, their net effect on the mutualism may be positive or negative. Ants and Ficus-associated wasps are a potential example. These wasps could represent sufficient food to ensure a permanent presence of predators. If this is the case then we may expect divergent selection (dependent on fig species) on traits facilitating or impeding ant predatory activity. Dioecious Ficus species in Brunei present the opportunity to determine whether presence of fig wasps on a tree ensures increased presence of ants because: (1) wasps are mainly present on male trees, thus allowing study of the effect of wasp abundance on ant presence; and (2) preliminary observations showed that ants present on trees were mainly predatory species that do not tend hemipterans. We show here, for several dioecious Ficus species, that many more ants were present on male trees than on female trees. Furthermore, these ants were mainly dominant predatory taxa that often nested in the male trees. Hence, wasps on male trees provide a sufficient resource in terms of quantity and reliability to ensure the continuous presence of dominant ants on the trees.

AB Birds face varying risk from parasites as they select and utilize habitat. Unfortunately, behavioral and habitat correlates of parasitism in birds are not well documented. This study combines data from a foraging behavior study with results from a banding study to test whether behavior and habitat affect an ectoparasite infestation by trombiculid mite (chigger) larvae on the bird community found in two different coffee agroecosystems in Chiapas, Mexico. Individuals from bird species with regular prevalence (i.e., infestation) foraged more frequently in lower vegetative layers and had significantly lower foraging height than those from species with little or no prevalence, suggesting that foraging near the ground increases exposure risk to chigger larvae. Using linear regression, across species, parasite prevalence decreased with increasing average foraging height. Lower infestation rates were found in coffee agroecosystems with higher management intensity (i.e., less shade and drier conditions), suggesting that management activities influence infestation rates. Consequently, drier tropical habitats may pose less risk to birds from ectoparasites, though seasonal prevalence was highest during the winter dry season. Although no direct link was found between host condition and infestation by chigger larvae on the wintering grounds, birds were sampled during the middle of the over-wintering period, not the end when infestation could affect birds fattening for migration.

AB In the SE Peruvian Amazon, large numbers of frugivorous bats regularly visit natural forest clearings known locally as collpas (which are also referred to as clay licks or mineral licks). Bats arrive at collpas to drink water that has accumulated in depressions created by larger geophagous mammals that consume exposed soil. Although collpa visitation is common, little is known about its causes and its ecological implications for the bat community. We compared patterns of use of collpas and non-collpa forest sites by bats in SE Peru. We mist netted bats at collpas and non-collpa sites during the dry season and compared abundance, species richness, species composition, sex ratio, and reproductive condition. More species were captured at collpas than at non-collpa sites, and collpas were visited almost exclusively by frugivores. Overall, bat-capture frequency and combined frugivorous bat-capture frequency were higher at collpas than at non-collpa sites, although some species of frugivorous bats were captured more frequently at non-collpa sites than at collpas (e.g., Carollia spp.). Irrespective of capture site, more female bats were pregnant or lactating than not, but there was a distinct female sex bias in bats that visited collpas: 70 percent of bats captured at collpas were female, whereas 44 percent of bats captured away from collpas were female. These patterns suggest that collpas may provide important resources for frugivorous bats in SE Peru, just as they are thought to provide important resources to the vertebrates that consume collpa soils. Accordingly, collpas are important conservation targets in the region.

AB The density of Brazilian tapirs (Tapirus terrestris) was studied in the northeastern part of the Pantanal wetlands of Brazil using two simultaneous and independent methods: (1) systematic camera trapping combined with capture-recapture analysis, with camera traps spaced I km apart and distributed over 54 km(2); and (2) line-transect sampling using an array of 12 linear transects, from 3.8 to 7.2 km long, covering the principal open and forest habitat types across the entire 1063 km(2) SESC Pantanal Reserve. The two methods yielded conservative density estimates of 0.58 +/- 0.11 tapirs/km(2) (camera trapping) and 0.55 (95% CI 0.30-1.01) tapirs/km(2) (line transects). The study suggests that certain Pantanal habitats and sites can sustain relatively high population densities of tapirs when these animals are protected from hunting. Further testing of the camera-trapping methodology as applied to tapirs is required, particularly focusing on extending the survey period. As it represents a relatively rapid method for estimating population density, in comparison to line-transect surveys, and as it generates information simultaneously on multiple species that are conservation priorities, we recommend that camera-trapping surveys be applied more widely across a variety of Pantanal habitats and land-use categories in order to confirm the value of the vast 140,000 km(2) wilderness region for this vulnerable species.

AB Forest fragmentation and selective logging can influence the life cycle of tropical tree species at several levels, e.g., by lowering pollination, by limiting seed dispersal, and by increasing seed predation. Understanding human-induced modifications in ecosystem processes such as seed predation is essential for conservation management of threatened species. We studied the impact of forest fragmentation and selective logging on seed predation of the endangered tree Prunus africana in the tropical rain forest of Kakamega, Kenya. We quantified the activity of seed predators in the main forest, forest fragments, and in sites of different logging intensity in the dry and rainy seasons of 2003 and 2006. Further, we performed predation experiments with single and groups of P africana seeds in the same sites. We recorded a tendency toward higher activity of seed predators in the main forest compared to fragmented sites. Single seeds, in contrast to groups of seeds, had marginally significantly higher predation rates in intensively logged compared to moderately logged sites. Overall, predation rates showed little relationship to seed predator activity and were highly variable among years and seasons. Additional studies on seedling establishment and survival are needed to predict whether the endangered tree is able to maintain sustainable populations in Kakamega Forest. Only by studying all processes in the life cycle is it possible to develop sound management strategies for the species.

AB Long-term bird population changes in response to natural or anthropogenic factors have been relatively well documented in the temperate zone, but rarely in the tropics, where there are few long-term data sets. Here, we analyze a 25-yr sequence of records of two species of Lophura pheasants, Siamese Fireback L. diardi and Silver Pheasant L. nycthemera in Khao Yai, Thailand's oldest national park. These data suggest that the number and proportion of detections of the lowlands-inhabiting L. diardi have increased significantly in relation to those of the higher elevation inhabitant L. nycthemera. Environmental factors mediated by changing climate are the most plausible explanation for the changing proportions of sightings of the two species. Further work is needed to explore in detail microhabitat selection of these birds and whether changes in microsite conditions on the forest floor or other factors are driving the observed distribution. Long-term monitoring of the avifauna along an elevational gradient is also recommended in tandem with increased monitoring of local climatic conditions.

AB The mechanisms through which forest fragmentation threatens the survival of mammal populations remain poorly known, yet knowledge of this process would greatly aid conservation efforts. I investigated ranging behaviors of diademed sifakas (Propithecus diadema) in continuous and fragmented forest at Tsinjoarivo, eastern Madagascar, using focal animal observations to examine home range size, daily path length (DPL), and habitat use relative to forest edges over 12 mo. Sifaka groups in forest fragments had home ranges that were 25-50 percent as large as continuous forest groups, and moderately reduced DPLs. Continuous forest groups foraged more than expected near forest edges while fragment groups avoided edges. Fragments have higher population density than continuous forest; however, several lines of evidence suggest that fragment groups' food resources may be denser, but lower quality. Continuous forest groups appear to be energy-maximizers, maintaining large ranges and preferentially feeding in rare fruiting trees found only in continuous forest interiors, while fragment groups appear to be time-minimizers, using small home ranges and primarily feeding on mistletoe (a fallback food in continuous forest). Therefore, the consequences of fragmentation on long-term viability remain unknown; it is possible that the advantage of increased density is outweighed by longer-term demographic challenges, or other threats (e.g., nutrition, health, social behavior, disease). When animals stranded in forest fragments exhibit complex and potentially unpredictable responses, simple ecological proxies (e.g., incidence patterns and density) are probably inadequate in assessing population health and viability. Ecological study and monitoring is essential in judging the viability of fragmented populations.

AB Tree cavities are a critical resource for many animals, especially as nesting sites for birds. Patterns of cavity distribution in temperate forests are well studied, yet little is known of cavities in tropical forests, despite a hypothesized decrease in cavity availability with decreasing latitude. We studied cavity density and distribution in a wet lowland tropical forest in Costa Rica and compared our results with estimates from forests around the world. Cavities at our site were common, occurred frequently in living trees, and were often formed by damage or decay rather than by woodpeckers. Most cavities had small openings, and woodpecker-created cavities were nonrandomly oriented. Contrary to prediction, cavity density appears to increase from the poles to the tropics. We suggest potential mechanisms to explain these patterns.

AB We determined the fruit predators and seed dispersers of two species of durian (Durio, Bombacaceae), D. graveolens and D. zibethinus, which have contrasting aril color and timing of dehiscence by observing fruiting trees in Deramakot forest reserve. In our observations in the wild, both species were extensively predated by orangutans before fruits matured. Durio graveolens was dispersed by black hombills and D. zibethinus was dispersed by long-tailed macaques.

AB We evaluated the performance of a method developed to estimate colony densities of the army ant Eciton burchellii, a keystone species, based on raid crossings on trails, in Costa Rica. The method was compared with a census obtained by tracking ant-following birds, and the effect of walking distance and rainfall was evaluated. We found that the method performs well when at least 60 km of trail have been walked (replicated walks are permissible), and when rainfall is avoided.

AB River damming causes ecosystem losses and habitat fragmentation. In the Cerrado, the flood affects mainly forested habitats in valleys. In 1996, the Tocantins River (Brazil) was dammed to create the Serra da Mesa hydroelectric plant, and 14 sites were monitored during flooding. Eight hills that formed islands were monitored with pitfall traps. Only one frog species was found on islands 3 yr after complete reservoir formation. Cerrado amphibians showed rapid decline during and after flooding.

AB Pollen and charcoal analysis of a 5.9-m-long sediment profile from a swamp on an alluvial terrace on the edge of La Selva biological station, Costa Rica (10 degrees 26 ' 23 '' N, 84 degrees 00 ' 24 '' W, 36 m asl), documents three millennia of human and natural disturbance within a lowland tropical rain forest. The record indicates that the highly diverse rain forest that presently surrounds the Cantarrana swamp regrew following forest clearing and maize agriculture that ended only a few centuries ago. The first maize pollen appears in sediments deposited similar to 1070 calendar-year BP. Older sediments below the 'maize zone' contain macroscopic charcoal, abundant microscopic charcoal, and possible pollen indicators of forest clearance, perhaps signaling local cultivation of root crops that left no pollen in the sediments. Interpretation of local archaeology indicates that La Selva reserve may have been most heavily populated during the El Bosque and La Selva regional archaeological phases from 2250-950 yr BP. However, the distribution of maize pollen in the sediments is clear evidence that the reserve was also occupied during the later La Cabana phase (950-400 yr BP), from which few artifacts have yet surfaced. Natural forest disturbance from treefalls and stream dynamics, and hydrological shifts associated with late-Holocene climate variability, form a backdrop to the human land-use history preserved in the Cantarrana sediment profile.

AB Dead wood is a substantial carbon stock in terrestrial forest ecosystems and hence a critical component of global carbon cycles. Given the limited amounts of dead wood biomass and carbon stock information for Caribbean forests, our objectives were to: (1) describe the relative contribution of down woody materials (DWM) to carbon stocks on the island of St. John; (2) compare these contributions among differing stand characteristics in subtropical moist and dry forests; and (3) compare down woody material carbon stocks on St. John to those observed in other tropical and temperate forests. Our results indicate that dead wood and litter comprise an average of 20 percent of total carbon stocks on St. John in both moist and dry forest life zones. Island-wide, dead wood biomass on the ground ranged from 4.55 to 28.11 Mg/ha. Coarse woody material biomass and carbon content were higher in moist forests than in dry forests. No other down woody material components differed between life zones or among vegetation categories (P > 0.05). Live tree density was positively correlated with fine woody material and litter in the moist forest life zone (R = 0.57 and 0.84, respectively) and snag basal area was positively correlated with total down woody material amounts (R = 0.50) in dry forest. Our study indicates that DWM are important contributors to the total biomass and, therefore, carbon budgets in subtropical systems, and that contributions of DWM on St. John appear to be comparable to values given for similar dry forest systems.

AB Seed dormancy may be disadvantageous for gregariously semelparous plants because it disrupts the high levels of reproductive synchrony necessary for success. Alternately, it may provide a bet-hedging option for an otherwise 'all eggs in the one basket' reproductive strategy. Rapid germination of seeds upon hydration has been demonstrated for a range of tropical, semelparous bamboos, but the fate of seeds that failed to germinate promptly has been inadequately investigated. We demonstrate prompt germination of seeds upon hydration and the absence of a dormant seedbank in a long-lived, gregariously semelparous bamboo, Bambusa arnhemica, from monsoonal northern Australia. However, we refute the suggestion that seed dormancy is necessarily maladaptive in a gregariously semelparous plant. Rather, caryopsis dormancy may not be possible in a seasonally moist tropical climate. Given an inability to adjust or bet-hedge their germination, bamboo germinants must cope with the vagaries of the monsoonal climate, a factor that may contribute to the general restriction of bamboos to regions with higher rainfall.

AB The tropical monodominant tree Dicymbe corymbosa reiterates via epicormic shoots and roots, resulting in multistemmed trees with complex pseudotrunks and root mounds. In 2 ha of primary forest on the Guiana Shield, we quantified the reiterative structure and aboveground soil development of 307 D. corymbosa individuals >= 10 cm dbh and investigated the potential adaptive significance of reiteration in terms of genet persistence and root exploitation of aboveground soil accumulations. We also investigated the incidence of the heart rot fungus Phellinus robustus in D. corymbosa and examined its relationship to the reiteration process. Large trees contained more and larger reiterations, greater trunk, root mound, and organic soil volumes, and a higher incidence of Phellinus than smaller trees. Roots and ectomycorrhizas were abundant in aboveground soils on the trees, occurred at higher densities than those of the surrounding forest floor, and may be important in recycling mineral nutrients. Stem turnover and reiteration were associated with Phellinus heart rot and appeared to be cumulative over time, resulting in persistent, structurally complex trees of indeterminate lifespan. Dicymbe corymbosa provides a rare example of a tree species that exploits both persistence and recruitment niches, as it successfully recruits through mast fruiting.

AB Biological corridors connect forest fragments, minimize the isolation of remaining habitats, and reduce the negative impact of fragmentation. Important studies in a corridor include documentation of land cover and the relationships between the plant community and land cover changes. In this study, density, species richness, and species diversity of palms of different life stages and growth forms were documented in forty 10 x 10 m census plots in the San Juan Biological Corridor (SJBC), Costa Rica. Changes in the percent cover of agricultural, partially forested, and forested lands from 1979 to 2001 were quantified based on existing land classifications. Associations between these palm community characteristics and the reduction in forest cover in 200-m and 1000-m annuli surrounding the census plots were investigated. These palm community characteristics were spatially interpolated to examine their distributions in SJBC. The community characteristics of palms of all growth forms varied among census plots. Forested lands in SJBC decreased from 88 percent to 26 percent during 1979-2001, while the percentage cover of agricultural and partially forested lands increased. The annual deforestation rate was 0.8 percent from 1979 to 1992, 4.3 percent from 1992 to 1997, and 7.5 percent from 1997 to 2001. Overall, palm community characteristics of small-canopy palms, dwarf palms, and cotyledonous seedlings had lower values with a lower percentage forest cover. The spatially interpolated palm community characteristics were consistently greatest within or adjacent to protected areas. This study demonstrates the complexity of the landscape and the effect of loss of adjacent forests on the palm community.

AB Populations at geographic range limits may frequently encounter changing biotic interactions as well as abiotic constraints. A conundrum in plant population biology, the frequent apparent overproduction of flowers, is thought to be a response by plant populations to unpredictable pollinator environments, such as those that may be expected at the range limit. We studied pollinator visitation rates and pollen limitation of fruit set in populations of Witheringia solanacea, a widespread bee-pollinated species. We compared two populations in the south and two in the north of Costa Rica, with each region encompassing a lower montane site at the upper elevational limit of the species range with small plant populations, and a premontane site where population densities were high. Populations in the south, where the climate was favorable, had higher pollinator visitation and higher natural fruit set, and showed only minor pollen limitation as compared with northern populations at windy sites near the Continental Divide. Lower montane populations had lower pollinator visitation rates than premontane populations but did not show more pollen limitation of fruit set. In general, pollen limitation was not inversely proportional to pollinator abundance but was higher where the climate is unpredictable.

AB The goal of this study was to examine seasonal frugivory by two sympatric peccary species (Tayassu pecari and T. tajacu) in a small (2178 ha), Atlantic Forest fragment on the inland plateau region of Sao Paulo State, Brazil. Fruit availability was determined with systematic ground surveys conducted over a 5-yr period. Examining fruit availability trends for dry and wet seasons, we found that species diversity was greater in the wet season, but the total number and dry mass of fruits were higher in the dry season. Fruit abundance in the dry season was due to one palm, 'jeriva' (Syagrus romanzoffiana), which could be considered a keystone species at Caetetus Ecological Station as it also supported a diverse array of mammals, birds, reptiles, and insects. White-lipped peccaries were the only ungulates that ate palmito fruits (Euterpe edulis) at Caetetus. They consumed ripe and unripe fruits and predated the seeds by chewing the pulp and seed. This occurred primarily during the dry season and was associated with a seasonal range shift and a preference for palmito habitat by the white-lipped peccaries. The dominance of fruits in peccary diets (80% fruit items in scat) has management implications for other plateau forest fragments. Forest fragments with diminished fruit abundance or diversity, or lacking key species such as S. romanzoffiana or E. edulis, will not support the energetic requirements of the characteristically large and highly mobile white-lipped peccary populations.

AB Studies on carnivores, which are generally difficult to observe directly because they are elusive and nocturnal, are carried out through indirect methods, e.g., camera trapping and radiotracking. The first method has been used to estimate population densities of species that can be differentiated as individuals using unique pelage patterns. However, the use of capture-recapture methodology has raised doubts regarding the estimation of the sampling area around the camera traps, which is obtained using maximum distances traveled by individuals photographed at two or more different locations. In this paper, the results from camera traps are compared with a radiotracking study carried out simultaneously with ocelots (Leopardus pardalis) to confirm whether maximum distances observed in camera traps coincide with ranging patterns determined from radio telemetry, and in turn whether the sampling areas estimated from camera traps are appropriate for estimating density. Mean maximum distance moved was 2880 m according to camera trap records during a 60-d survey period while, with radiotracking, the maximum distance moved was 3176 m during the same period. The difference is not significant, and the sampling areas estimated with camera traps to assess ocelot density are reliable. However, if the area covered by cameras is reduced to less than three to four times average home range for the target species, then density estimates from camera trapping are exaggerated because of the reduced observed distances and the fact that multiple individuals can overlap in relatively small areas.

AB The reasons that forest vertebrates differ in their response to selective timber extraction in tropical forests remain poorly characterized. Understanding what determines response and sensitivity can indicate how forest management might yield greater conservation benefits, and help us identify which lesser-known species may be especially vulnerable. We assessed the response of 41 Bornean mammals to selective timber harvest and tested eight hypotheses regarding the correlation between those responses and a range of species characteristics. Multivariate analyses show that phylogenetic species age is a key variable determining sensitivity. Older species are less able to cope with the effects of selective timber harvest. Most of these species are endemic to insular southeast Asia, and do not occur on the Asian mainland. These species are more specialized, and appear less able to cope with habitat change. In contrast, species tolerant to logging evolved more recently. This group tends to be omnivorous or herbivorous, to use all vegetation strata, and to be regionally widespread. This finding allows the sensitivity to habitat disturbance of lesser-known species to be predicted, and therefore has important conservation implications. These new insights also help in the design of large-scale forest landscapes that combine sustainable forest management and species conservation requirements. We recognize that these functions can be compatible, but that some species still need completely protected areas for their survival.

AB Invasive alien plants affect the functioning of ecosystems by altering plant-animal interactions, such as pollination, which may impede natural regeneration of native plant species. In Mauritius, we studied the reproductive traits and pollination ecology of the rare endemic cauliflorous tree Syzygium mamillatum in a restored forest (all alien plant species removed) and an adjacent unrestored area (degraded by alien plants). Flowers of S. mamillatum were only visited by generalist bird species. Although the initial number of flower buds per tree in the restored forest tended to be higher than that of trees in the unrestored area, final fruit set and the number of seeds per fruit were lower in the restored forest. This corresponded with lower bird visitation rates in the restored area. Additionally, during budding stage, most trees were severely attacked by lepidopteran larvae, and bud loss through herbivory was higher in the restored forest. Thus, the difference in reproductive performance of S. mamillatum between the two localities was caused by contrasting herbivore attack and bird visitation behavior in restored and unrestored areas. Our findings illustrate the importance of restoration efforts in mimicking the original physical structure of habitats and interaction structure of interspecific relationships, and the difficulty of doing so given the imperfect knowledge and the reality that many native species have become locally extinct and replaced by exotic species.

AB In managed landscapes, tree-dominated habitats often show promise for biodiversity conservation. In Bangladesh where natural forest cover is less than 10 percent, homegardens, which are maintained by at least 20 millions households, represent one possible strategy for biodiversity conservation. This study investigated the floristic and structural diversity of 402 homegardens from six regions across southwestern Bangladesh. All plants were censused, totaling 419 species (59% native), including six IUCN Red Listed. The median homegarden (800 m(2)) contained a mean of 34 species. Each region contained a mean of 293 species in a mean of 67 homegardens. A total of 49,478 individuals (107 per homegarden and 1003 per hectare) of trees and shrubs were counted from 45.2 ha total sampled area. Thus, significant botanical richness was exhibited in the homegardens across southwestern Bangladesh. However, most species were rare: 82 percent of all species including 189 native were found in 50 or fewer homegardens, and 63 species (36 native) were found in only one or two homegardens. Sixty percent of all tree and shrub species had 50 or fewer individuals each. Thus, whereas richness across the landscape was high, serious effort must be made to increase the populations of most species. We propose three main conservation activities: (1) awareness building; (2) protection of existing individuals of rare species; and (3) propagation. Overlaying all of these activities is the inclusion of local communities in the process, who were the ones to retain these species in homegardens in the first place, and the stakeholders who will determine whether homegardens indeed act as long-term repositories to biodiversity conservation.

AB Fruiting trees in degraded areas are attractive for frugivorous birds and may become centers of regeneration. However, a number of tree species in degraded areas are exotic species. Thus, the question arises whether these exotic species can also act as foci for forest regeneration. In the farmland adjacent to Kakamega Forest, Kenya, we investigated the frugivore assemblage in, and seed rain and seedling establishment under, 29 fruiting exotic guava trees (Psidium guajava) at different distances to the forest. The results show that 40 frugivorous bird species visited guava trees. All of the seed and 82 percent of the seedling species found under the treecrowns were animal dispersed, 58 and 57 percent of them late-successional species, respectively. Path analysis revealed that the abundance of frugivorous birds, seeds, and seedlings did not decrease up to a distance of 2 km from the forest. Surprisingly, the abundance of frugivorous shrubland birds, animal-dispersed seeds, and late-successional seeds showed an increase with increasing distance from forest. Even though they are exotics, fruiting guava trees may have a positive effect on forest regeneration and might prove valuable for management plans concerning forest restoration.

AB Hawaiian dominant tree species Metrosideros polymorpha varieties glaberrima and polymorpha have glabrous and pubescent leaves, respectively. Sympatric populations at 2040 m elevation showed major differentiation beyond the pubescence itself. The varieties differed substantially in stomatal traits and in leaf composition, leaf water status, and instantaneous gas exchange rates, despite similarity in leaf and wood cross-sectional anatomy. Functional differentiation among varieties represents a possible mechanism facilitating the occupation of an exceptional ecological range.

A total of 901 seeds (20 morphospecies) were retrieved from 50 nests, most of them intact and able to germinate. Considering the abundance of Pheidole species and the evidence pointing to their potential as seed dispersers, these ants may be important determinants of the recruitment of small-seeded plants in tropical forests.

AB For pollination studies of forest species it is sometimes only possible to work on those flowers nearest to the ground. We test whether using low flowers introduces bias, by measuring height effects on bird visitation and fruit set in one mistletoe species pollinated by bellbirds in New Zealand. At this site, previous studies have shown fruit set near the ground to be pollen limited. We measured fruit set on 32 mistletoes at different heights in 11 host trees. Mistletoe fruit set varied significantly among host trees but did not vary with height. Although bellbirds generally forage preferentially in the upper part of the forest, mistletoe flowers appear to be attractive enough to ensure adequate visitation and fruit set at all heights.

Feeding roosts were identified within 500 m around parent trees and the types and number of seed loads under each roost were recorded. We found feeding roost density decreased with increasing distance from the parent, but found no correlation between distance and seed deposition. The effect of bat digestion on seed germination was investigated, and we found that germination percentage of all treatments involving ingestion by bats was significantly lower than control seeds and some germination parameters of seeds from different treatments changed.

AB Individual-level diet variation was investigated in Gracilinanus microtarsus, an insectivorous marsupial whose diet is affected by sex and season in the highly seasonal Brazilian Cerrado. To measure individual-level diet variation, the diets of individual males and females were compared to that of their population in the warm-wet and cool-dry seasons using the proportional similarity index (PSi). This index varies from 1 (complete overlap between the individual i 's and population's diets) toward 0 (decreasing overlap). Mean PSi values were computed as a measure of the degree of interindividual diet variation (the larger the mean PSi value, the smaller the variation among individuals' diets). Interindividual diet variation among females was similar between seasons, whereas among males it decreased from the warm-wet to the cool-dry season. Diet variation among males is probably reduced in the cool-dry season because of constraints on food consumption generated by interactions between endogenous (physiological needs associated with high rates of body mass growth) and exogenous (food limitation) factors.

AB Soil charcoal is an indicator of Holocene fires as well as a palaeoecological signature of pre-Colombian land use in Neotropical rain forests. To document rain forest fire history, we examined soil charcoal patterns in continuous old-growth forests along an elevational transect from sea level to the continental divide on the Atlantic slope of Costa Rica. At 10 elevations we sampled 1-ha plots, using 16 cores/ha to collect 1.5-m deep soil samples. We found charcoal in soils at every elevation, with total dry mass ranging from 3.18 g/m(2) at 2000-m elevation to as much as 102.7 g/m(2) at 300 m. Soil charcoal is most abundant at the wettest lowland sites (60-500 m) and less at montane elevations (> 1000 m) where there is less rainfall. Between 30- and 90-cm soil depth, soil charcoal is present consistently and every 1-ha plot has charcoal evidence for multiple fire events. Radiocarbon dates range from 23,240 YBP at 1750-m elevation to 140 YBP at 2600 m. Interestingly, none of the charcoal samples from 2600 m are older than 170 yr, which suggests that forests near the continental divide are relatively young replacement stands that have re-established since the most recent localized volcanic eruption on Volcan Barva. We propose that these old-growth forests have been disturbed infrequently but multiple times as a consequence of anthropogenic and natural fires.

AB Drought is an important seedling mortality agent in dry and moist tropical forests, and more severe and frequent droughts are predicted in the future. The effect of drought on leaf gas exchange and seedling survival was tested in a dry-down experiment with four tree species from dry and moist forests in Bolivia. Seedlings were droughted and wilting stage and gas exchange were monitored. Drought led to a gradual reduction of photosynthesis and stomatal conductance over time, whereas respiration and photosynthetic water-use efficiency initially increased with drought and then declined. Seedlings gradually went through the different wilting stages, until they eventually died, but the trajectory differed for the four species. The strong relationship between wilting stage and photosynthesis means that simple field observations can provide valuable information on plant physiological performance. Three different drought strategies were identified. Dry forest species Ceiba samauma shed its leaves and survived. The moist forest species Cariniana ianeirensis postponed drought stress by having low rates of transpiration and high water-use efficiency. Dry forest Astronium urundeuva and moist forest Triplaris americana followed an opportunistic strategy; they are early successional species that can quickly grow to maturity but periodic drought can be lethal. Strikingly, dry and moist forest species did not differ clearly in their drought tolerance strategies.

AB The interactive effects of forest disturbance and fragmentation on tropical tree assemblages remain poorly understood. We examined the effects of forest patch and landscape metrics, and levels of forest disturbance on the patterns of floristic composition and abundance of tree functional groups within 21 forest fragments and two continuous forest sites in southern Brazilian Amazonia. Trees were sampled within 60 (10 x 250 m) plots placed in the core areas of the fragments. Tree assemblage composition and abundance were summarized using nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS). Forest patch size explained 36.2 percent and 30 percent of the variance in the proportion of small-seeded softwood and hardwood stems in the 21 forest patches, respectively. Large fragments retained a higher abundance of hardwood tree species whereas small-seeded softwood trees appear to proliferate rapidly in small disturbed fragments. Generalized linear mixed models showed that time since fragmentation had both positive and negative effects on the density of different functional groups of trees and on the ordination axes describing tree abundance. The composition and abundance of different tree genera were also related to time since fragmentation, distance to the nearest edge, and fire severity, despite the recent post-isolation history of the forest patches surveyed. Both the proliferation of fast-growing pioneer trees and the decline of hardwood trees found in our forest plots have profound consequences on the floristic composition, forest dynamics, carbon storage, and nutrient cycling in Amazonian forest fragments.

AB In the Janzen-Connell hypothesis, host-specific natural enemies enhance species diversity and influence the structure of plant communities. This study tests the explicit assumption of host specificity for soil pathogens of the genus Pythium that cause damping-off disease of germinating seeds and seedlings. We isolated Pythium spp. from soil of a tropical forest in Panama. Then, in an inoculation experiment, we determined the pathogenicity of 75 tropical isolates of unknown pathogenicity and seven pathogenic temperate isolates of Pythium on seeds and/or seedlings of eight tropical tree species. Only three tropical isolates, one identified as P. ultimum and two as P. aphanidermatum, were pathogenic. Tropical pathogenic isolates were pathogenic on 4-6 of eight tree species. Temperate isolates were pathogenic on 0-4 of eight species, indicating that some tropical tree species are susceptible to novel isolates of Pythium. No tree species was susceptible to all isolates and two species were not susceptible to any isolate. Collectively, these results indicate that these Pythium isolates vary widely in their pathogenicity, causing differential mortality of potential host species; likewise, the tree species vary in their susceptibility to a given Pythium isolate. These differences in pathogenicity and susceptibility indicate some support for the Janzen-Connell assumption of host specificity. While they are not restricted to a single species, their intermediate level of specificity suggests that Pythium spp. have the potential to have some effect on forest community structure and diversity.

AB Fragmentation that alters mutualistic relationships between plants and frugivorous animals may reduce the seed dispersal of trees. We examined the effects of forest fragmentation on the distributions of seeds and seedlings of a Central Amazon endemic tree, Duckeodendron cestroides. In the dry seasons of 2002-2004, seeds and first-year seedlings were counted within wedge-shaped transects centered around Duckeodendron adults in fragments and nearby continuous forests at the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragmentation Project. Analyses showed that fragmentation reduced seed dispersal quantity and quality. The percent and distance of dispersed seeds were both twice as great in continuous forest as in fragments. The distances of each tree's five furthest dispersed seeds were three times greater in continuous forest than fragments. Over the 3-yr study, 20 times more seeds were dispersed more than 10 m from parent crowns in continuous forest than fragments. A regression analysis showed more dispersed seeds at all distances in continuous forest than fragments. Dispersal differences were strong in 2002 and 2004, years of large fruit crops, but weak or absent in 2003, when fruit production was low. As distance from parent crowns increased, the number of seedlings declined more rapidly in fragments than continuous forest. Distance-dependent mortality between the seed and seedling stages appeared to be more important in continuous forest than fragments. This research provides ample, indirect evidence demonstrating that forest fragmentation can result in the breakdown of a seed dispersal mutualism, potentially jeopardizing the reproduction of a rare, tropical tree.

AB Ant predation is widely believed to play an important role in life history and evolution of tropical social wasps. While army ants are known to cause high rates of nest loss in swarm-founding social wasps, no studies have quantified the impact of predation by non-army ants on colony success. In this study we recorded survivorship of colonies of the swarm-founding wasp, Polybia occidentalis, in Costa Rica at a site where we suspected that scouting-and-recruiting ants cause nest abandonment. We found that scouting-and-recruiting ants prey upon active nests of P. occidentalis, and conclude that predation by these ants is an important brood mortality factor in the life history of P. occidentalis colonies at our field site.

AB The Amazon Basin can be divided into two geomorphological regions based on the age of its soils: young (< 30 mya) and old (> 300 mya). We tested the effects of soil age on dung beetle communities by comparing biomass, abundance, and species between reserves in Ecuador on young soils and reserves in Brazil on old soils. Beetle biomass in the old Amazon was one-third that in the young Amazon, and beetle abundance in the old Amazon was one-fourth that in the young Amazon. Species richness, rarefied to equal sample sizes, was not significantly different between old and young soils. These data suggest young soils of the Amazon support a significantly greater biomass and abundance of dung beetles than old soils, but that species richness across the Basin is similar. As dung beetles are bio-indicators of mammals, our data support previous studies indicating a greater biomass of mammals on young versus old Amazon soils.

AB We compared the population dynamics of a riparian ranid frog, Rana swinhoana, before (1996-1999) and after (1999-2001) a strong earthquake. This earthquake caused little disturbance to the vegetation and landscape of the study site but the stream and ponds dried up within a week. Nearly all frogs marked (1002 of 1004) before the earthquake had disappeared after the earthquake. Smaller, unmarked frogs began to appear in stream habitats about 9 mo after the earthquake, and the frog population was much smaller than it was before the earthquake. Population dynamics and temporal and spatial distribution of frogs before and after the earthquake correlated closely with the hydrology of the stream and ponds. The movement patterns of frogs before and after the earthquake were similar, suggesting frog behavior did not change in response to drastic changes in hydrology, and frogs continued to exhibit strong site-fidelity. Following the earthquake, stream water volume was much lower, especially in the summer, which allowed the normally winter-breeding frogs to breed year-round. Results demonstrate that a population of R. swinhoana can disappear suddenly as the result of a natural disturbance. We propose that anuran species that exhibit strong site-fidelity are particularly susceptible to extirpation of local populations because frogs may lack the behavioral plasticity to respond to sudden water depletion.

AB Habitat fragmentation and conversion are among the human activities that pose the greatest threat to species persistence and conservation of biodiversity. This is particularly true in the Neotropics, where bats represent important components of biodiversity from taxonomic and functional perspectives, and provide critical ecosystem services (e.g., seed dispersal and pollination). We assessed the degree to which conversion of lowland Amazonian rain forest to agriculture, and its subsequent abandonment and secondary succession, affect the abundances of populations of phyllostomid bats in the vicinity of Iquitos, Peru. During 90,720 net-m-h of sampling, we captured 3789 bats of five families; of these 3764 were phyllostomids representing 44 species, 23 genera, and three feeding guilds. We focus on the 24 most abundant species of phyllostomids. In terms of abundance, frugivores dominated assemblages in all habitat types and seasons. Eight species consistently responded to habitat conversion, two species consistently responded to season, two species responded consistently to both habitat and season, and five species responded to habitat conversion in a season-specific manner. Frugivores and nectarivores were abundant in areas that had been converted to agriculture, which suggests that these bats are resilient to extant levels of disturbance and may be important in promoting secondary succession. However, this result may be scale- or context-dependent. If habitat conversion continues and dramatically reduces the areal extent and increases fragmentation of mature forest, then a complex metacommunity dynamic may characterize the region and source populations of bats may become threatened or extirpated locally.

AB The island of Sulawesi is the largest in Indonesian Wallacea, one of the most important ecoregions in SE Asia and globally. Here, we generate a comprehensive and detailed map of forest type, its condition, and some of its threats, which highlights key forest conservation areas, pinpoints frontlines within them, and provides the basis for the development of more specific objectives. We relied upon a variety of techniques to generate five main descriptors of forest quality: condition, its level of endangerment, its landscape setting, its simulated fate given a simple model of forest change, and its overall size. Using the results of this analysis, we assessed the existing protected areas (PA), recognized by the Indonesian government, and a conservation portfolio (CP) generated by a recently completed Ecoregional Conservation Assessment (ECA). Our map of conservation priorities is congruent with previous conservation activities, although several priority areas were identified outside of the current PA system and should be the focus of strategic protected area development. Our ranking system is simple, transparent, and flexible. Its modular construction will allow local managers to choose among available proxy measures and to add their own conservation values according to specific priorities and desired outcomes. We envision this analysis as the foundation upon which more specific conservation strategies, based upon detailed biotic information as it becomes available, can be developed.

AB The populations of the Mexican mantled howler monkey (Alouatta palliata mexicana) in the Los Tuxtlas region, Mexico, have declined drastically due to habitat loss and fragmentation. Nevertheless, several troops still inhabit very small and isolated rain forest fragments. We identified the main vegetation attributes that can favor the presence of howlers within 18 small (< 10-ha) fragments that did not differ significantly in size, shape, and isolation (nine occupied and nine unoccupied by howlers). We found that habitat quality (i.e., food resources and vegetation structure) affected howler incidence in small fragments. Particularly, the occupied fragments showed greater density of big trees (dbh > 60 cm), greater total basal area, greater basal area of persistent tree species, and greater basal area of top food species than the unoccupied fragments; suggesting that even for small fragments the loss of big trees and particularly the decrease in size class of the top food species can negatively affect howler distribution in highly fragmented landscapes. These findings could be used to establish foreground conservation areas for this critically endangered subspecies in fragmented landscapes of Los Tuxtlas.

AB Adaptations that reduce water retention on leaf surfaces may increase photosynthetic capacity of cloud forests because carbon dioxide diffuses slower in water than air. Leaf water repellency was examined in three distinct ecosystems to test the hypothesis that tropical montane cloud forest species have a higher degree of leaf water repellency than species from tropical dry forests and species from temperate foothills-grassland vegetation. Leaf water repellency was measured by calculating the contact angle of the leaf surface and the line tangent to a water droplet through the point of contact on the adaxial and the abaxial surface. Leaf water repellency was significantly different between the three study areas. The hypothesis that leaf water repellency is higher in cloud forest species than tropical dry forests and temperate foothills-grassland vegetation was not confirmed in this study. Leaf water repellency was lower for cloud forest species (adaxial surface = 50.8 degrees; abaxial surface = 82.9 degrees) than tropical dry forest species (adaxial surface = 74.5 degrees; abaxial surface = 87.3 degrees) and temperate foothills-grassland species (adaxial surface = 77.6 degrees; abaxial surface = 95.8 degrees). The low values of leaf water repellency in cloud forest species may be influenced by presence of epiphylls and loss of epicuticular wax on the leaf surfaces.

The late discovery of these ants and high diversity of their associates indicates that much remains to be discovered even in one of the most intensely studied research areas.

AB The amount of space used by an organism is energetically determined. We utilized a population of ant lion larvae in Costa Rica to test allometric theories concerning the use of space by organisms and how different densities of individuals affect the use of space. The area of ant lion trapping pits scaled with mass to the three-quarters power, supporting allometric theory for sessile organisms. Our analyses also show that larger ant lion larvae show spatial repulsion and facultative density dependent pit-building strategies.

AB For hundreds of millions of people, biodiversity is about eating, staying healthy, and finding shelter. Meeting these people's basic needs should receive greater priority in the conservation agenda. Wild and semi-wild plants and animals contribute significantly to nutrition, health care, income, and culture in developing countries, and the poorest and most vulnerable people often rely on those resources most. Depleting those resources or making them inaccessible can impoverish these people even further. 'Pro-poor conservation'-that is, conservation that aims to support poor people-explicitly seeks to address basic human needs. Such an emphasis has many potential synergies with more conventional conservation goals. Nonetheless, pro-poor conservation requires a distinct attitude to gauging conservation outcomes and a different approach to conservation science. Biologists can make a vital contribution.

AB Land-use change in the Sarapiqui region of Costa Rica has resulted in a fragmented forest landscape with abrupt edges between forest and pasture. Forest responses to edge effects vary widely and can significantly affect ecosystem integrity. Our objective was to examine forest structure at 20+ yr old forest-pasture edges in Sarapiqui. Three transects with 0.095-ha plots at seven distances from forest edges were established in each of six forest patches. Stem density, basal area, and aboveground biomass in trees and palms >= 10-cm diameter at breast height were measured in all plots. In addition, hemispherical photographs were taken to determine leaf area index, understory light availability, and percent canopy openness. Linear mixed-effects models showed significantly higher tree stem density at forest edges, relative to interiors, a pattern reflected by increased stem density, basal area, and aboveground biomass in small diameter trees (<= 20 cm) growing near edges. No differences in total tree basal area, aboveground biomass, or hemispherical photograph-derived parameters were detected across the forest edge to interior gradient. The recruitment of small diameter trees following edge creation has contributed to the development of dense vegetation at the forest edge and has aided in the maintenance of similar tree basal area and aboveground biomass between edge and interior environments. These data reflect on the robustness of forest edges in Sarapiqui, a characteristic that will likely minimize future detrimental edge effects and promote a number of high-value environmental services in these forests.

AB Global comparisons suggest that rates of N fixation in tropical rain forests may be among the highest on earth. However, data supporting this contention are rare, and the factors that regulate N fixation within the biome remain largely unknown. We conducted a full-factorial (N x P) fertilization experiment in two lowland tropical rain forests in Costa Rica to explore the effects of nutrient availability on rates of free-living N fixation in leaf litter and soil. P fertilization significantly increased N fixation rates in both leaf litter and soil, and the effect was dependent on sampling date. Fertilization with N did not affect rates of N fixation at any time. In addition, variation in N fixation rates measured in unfertilized plots at four sampling time points suggested seasonal variability in N fixation: leaf litter N fixation ranged from 0.36 kg/ha/yr in the dry season to 5.48 kg/ha/yr in the wet season. Soil N fixation showed similar patterns ranging from a dry season low of 0.26 kg/ha/yr to a wet season high of 2.71 kg/ha/yr. While the observed temporal variability suggests potential climatic control over free-living N fixation in these forests, data suggest that neither soil nor leaf litter moisture alone regulate N fixation rates. Instead, we hypothesize that a combination of ample C availability, low leaf litter N:P ratios, and high rainfall coincide during the latter portions of the rainy season and drive the highest free-living N fixation rates of the year.

AB Leaf-litter decomposition is a major component of carbon and nutrient dynamics in tropical forest ecosystems, and moisture availability is widely considered to be a major influence on decomposition rates. Here, we report the results of a study of leaf-litter decomposition of five tree species in response to dry-season irrigation in a tropical forest regrowth stand in the Brazilian Amazon; three experiments differing in the timing of installation and duration allowed for an improved resolution of irrigation effects on decomposition. We hypothesized that decomposition rates would be faster under higher moisture availability in the wet season and during dry-season irrigation periods in the treatment plots, and that decomposition rates would be faster for species with higher quality leaves, independent of treatment. The rates of decomposition (k) were up to 2.4 times higher in irrigated plots than in control plots. The highest k values were shown by Annona paludosa (0.97 to 1.26/yr) while Ocotea guianensis (0.73 to 0.85/yr) had the lowest values; intermediate rates were found for Lacistema pubescens (0.91 to 1.02/yr) and Vismia guianensis (0.91 to 1.08/yr). These four tree species differed significantly in leaf-litter quality parameters (nitrogen, phosphorus, lignin, and cellulose concentrations, as well as lignin:nitrogen and carbon:nitrogen ratios), but differences in decomposition rates among tree species were not strictly correlated with leaf-litter quality. Overall, our results show that dry-season moisture deficits limit decomposition in Amazonian forest regrowth.

AB We described the plant communities on a large landslide in a human-dominated area of tropical dry forest landscape (Casita Volcano, Nicaragua) and in the adjacent forest, 3 yr after landslide occurrence. At both sites, we determined the relationships between spatial changes in environmental factors and the spatial distribution of species and plant traits. Subsequently, we tested the hypothesis that the compositional similarity between the landslide and the forest increased with a decrease in the distance from the forest edge and the width of the landslide. In the forest, the spatial distribution of species and plant traits was determined mainly by an elevational gradient that was associated with the amount of bare soil, whereas, on the landslide, there was no such gradient but species distributions were influenced mostly by the presence of residual agricultural and forest soils and human disturbance. We did not find an increase in compositional similarity between the landslide and the forest at the edge or in the narrow zones of the landslide. Compared to other landslides, the recovery process was strongly influenced by the extreme abiotic heterogeneity, climate seasonality, and human use in the area. The study of succession in tropical dry landslides located in densely populated zones should focus on understanding the response of regional ecosystems to a complex disturbance regime in which human-induced disturbances play a major role.

AB The "Initial Floristic Composition" hypothesis is applied to secondary tropical rain forest succession in abandoned agricultural fields with light previous land-use and close to seed sources. This hypothesis predicts that both pioneer and shade-tolerant species colonize a site directly after abandonment, and as the canopy closes, the recruitment of pioneers sharply declines, while recruitment of shade-tolerant species continues. It also predicts higher mortality among pioneers. Consequently, recruited and dead trees are expected to differ in species composition, with highest species richness for the recruits. During 18 mo, we monitored recruitment and mortality of trees with height >= 1.5 m in eight plots in abandoned cornfields with initial fallow age of 1-5 yr, in SE Mexico. Shade-tolerant species established in the first years of succession, albeit in low numbers. As predicted, recruited and dead trees differed in species richness and composition, and in shade-tolerant frequency. In contrast to our expectations, over 50 percent of recruits were from pioneer species, as high stand-level mortality opened new opportunities for continued pioneer colonization. Species turnover starts very early in succession but is not always a gradual and continuous process, complicating prevailing succession models. The strong spatial and temporal variability of succession emphasizes the need to monitor these dynamics in permanent plots across a range of initial stand ages, with multiple plots in a given age class.

AB Mammillaria gaumeri, an endemic cactus from Yucatan, is threatened due to human-mediated habitat fragmentation but knowledge regarding factors that would inform management plans is limited, including information on optimal microhabitats and growth. We studied seasonal patterns of microclimate, net CO(2) uptake and growth of adult individuals during the dry, rainy and northwind (late fall to winter) seasons in separate populations located in a coastal dune and in a dry forest. To provide an assay of primary productivity, we measured the production of new axillary buds (areoles) from the apex. We found that patterns of net CO(2) uptake in the three seasons were consistent with obligate crassulacean acid metabolism. The reduction in soil water potential and the increase in water vapor pressure deficit led to a reduction in 24-h net CO(2) uptake from 18.0 to 1.3 mmol CO(2)/m(2), after 30 d of drought. Dry-weight gain was maximal during the rainy season and there was no growth during the dry season, thus seasonal patterns of net CO(2) uptake and growth for M. gaumeri reflected soil and atmospheric water contents. Annual dry-weight gain increased linearly with plant size and with total daily photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) up to 80 percent of ambient. Maximal growth was in exposed microhabitats receiving 60-80 percent of total ambient PPFD. We hypothesize that low-magnitude disturbances, resulting in more exposed microhabitats, might be beneficial for growth and conservation of adult individuals of this rare species.

AB Six microsatellite loci were used to compare the mating system and gene flow in two consecutive years of a natural, unlogged population of Symphonia globulifera in a 500 ha experimental plot in the Brazilian Amazon (Flona Tapajos). The species had a low density of reproductive trees per hectare (d= 0.46 trees/ha). We analyzed 205 trees and 261 and 487 open-pollinated seeds from 26 and 30 mother-trees in the years 2002 and 2003, respectively. A significant spatial genetic structure was detected for the adult trees for distances up to 100 m. We observed only small interannual differences in multilocus outcrossing rate V,(2002) = 1,000, (2003) = 0.998), biparental inbreeding (, -, (2002) = 0-093,, -,(2003) = 0.063), and paternity correlation r(p)(2002) = 0.414, p(2003) = 0.386). The number of pollen donors contributing to mating of each tree in both years was estimated to be low = 2.4 - 4.0). Using TwoGENER analysis to calculate the density of reproductive trees and the distance of pollen dispersal for normal and exponential models, the lowest error was detected for exponential model. For this model, the estimated density of reproductive trees was lower in 2002 (d(e),(2oo2) = 0.03 trees/ha) than 2003 (d(e),(2003) = 0.19 trees/ha), resulting in a higher distance of pollen dispersal in 2002 ( (2002) = 444 m) than 2003 ( (2003) = 154 m), although these changes did not affect the outcrossing and correlated mating rates.

AB We studied the ecological distribution of pteridophytes (ferns and fern allies) along eight 8-km transects covering 12.7 ha in Peruvian Amazonia. Subunits of 200 m(2) of the transects have previously been classified into four different forest types, and here we document and quantify the floristic differences among these forest types. Pteridophytes have been suggested as an indicator group to classify rain forest habitats, but this requires that the ecological preferences of the species are well documented and consistent across geographic regions. Here we analyzed in detail the distribution and diversity patterns of 130 species across the four rain forest types. Relative species abundance and species diversity were similar among some of the forest types and differed among others, but the species composition differed markedly. Our results largely confirmed the earlier interpretation of the edaphic preferences of the pteridophyte species in western Amazonia. This supports the proposition that deterministic processes have an important role in influencing the floristic composition of Amazonian forests.

AB Pumas (Puma concolor) are an endangered species due to habitat loss and the ever-growing conflict with expanding human populations. We used genetic analysis of feces, a noninvasive study method, to determine the presence of pumas and their estimated minimum population in two protected areas in the northeast of Sao Paulo State, Brazil: Jatai Ecological Station and Vassununga State Park. We were able to identify the species that originally deposited the feces by means of amplification of a portion of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene and comparison of this fragment with reference sequences from pumas and other carnivores present in the region. We used a panel containing four microsatellite loci to individualize each of the samples collected. Among the 20 fecal samples, we identified 10 as clearly belonging to pumas and two as belonging to ocelots (Leopardus pardalis), a species sympatric with P. concolor. By plotting the feces sampling points against a satellite image, we determined the presence of at least nine puma individuals in the region, three in the Jatai Ecological Station, four in the Vassununga State Park, and two in their surroundings. The identity probability was 0.0001 and the occurrence of allelic dropout was 10.6 percent. The presence of pumas, the estimate of their minimum population size, as well as their distribution, constitute an important tool for the implementation of management and conservation programs in the areas studied and their surroundings.

We sampled regenerating trees in 25 pastures distributed in four age classes ranging from < 6 to 40 yr of use. Density and composition of regenerating trees did not change with pasture age, but richness was lower in 25- and 40-yr-old pastures. Nonetheless, a number of species seem to be able to resprout even after 40 yr of ranching.

AB Some studies have recently reported high diploid male frequencies in euglossine bees indicating possible population declines. We estimated the genetic variability and frequency of males that are diploid in five Colombian species of euglossine bees using allozyme markers. Expected heterozygosities ranged from 0.10 to 0.23. Diploid males were found in three species with frequencies ranging from 8 to 32 percent. Our results suggest that some species are more susceptible to environmental changes and anthropogenic pressure.

AB Driver ants (i.e., epigaeic species in the army ant genus Dorylus, subgenus Anomma) are among the most extreme polyphagous predators, but termites appear to be conspicuously absent from their prey spectrum and attacks by driver ants on termite nests have not yet been described. Here, we report a Dorylus (Anomma) rubellus attack on a colony of the fungus-growing termite Macrotermes subhyalinus that was observed during the dry season in a savannah habitat in Nigeria's Gashaka National Park. It was estimated that several hundred thousand termites (probably more than 2.4 kg dry mass) were retrieved. The apparent rarity of driver ant predation on Macrotermes nests may be explained by different habitat requirements, by the fact that these ants mostly forage aboveground, by efficient termite defense behavior and nest architecture that make entry into the nest difficult, and finally by driver ant worker morphology, which differs remarkably from that of subterranean Dorylus species that regularly invade and destroy termite colonies.

AB There are four species of Graptophyllum (Acanthaceae) in Australia which span a gradient in rarity and conservation status from the most endangered, Graptophyllum reticulation (endangered), to G. ilicifolium (vulnerable), to G. excelsum (rare), to the least endangered G. spinigerum (widespread). Graptophyllum reticulatum and G. ilicifolium are each only known from three locations. All species were found to have quite high levels of genetic diversity (H-e, A, A(p), P) and there was no significant difference among species in genetic diversity (P > 0.05), thus, genetic diversity was unrelated to conservation status or species geographic range. All species had high allelic fixation values (F), indicating that Populations were effectively inbred regardless of conservation status and geographic range. The genetic diversity among Populations (F-ST) was not related to rarity and contrasted among the most restricted species, where diversity among populations was twice as high among G. reticulatum Populations (F-ST, 0.22) compared with among G. ilicifolium populations (F-ST, 0.11).

AB The nectar resource environment across which nectarivores forage may be patchy and variable. To understand the sources and consequences of such a variation, nectar production was investigated in Calliandra longipedicellata. Nectar was measured once a month throughout a 3-mo winter season in two Successive years at three sites. We also conducted diurnal and nocturnal field observations to describe visitation rates of floral visitors, and a pollinator exclusion experiment to evaluate diurnal and nocturnal pollination at the three sites. In all populations, nectar secretion was primarily nocturnal, although flowers produced some nectar during the day. Sugar production per flower varied significantly at both the seasonal and population levels, although nectar production rates and a well-defined afternoon to morning production pattern were consistent across months, populations, and years. Average nectar production rates were high compared to other Calliandra species, and to most hummingbird- or hawkmoth-pollinated plants in the region. Flowers were regularly visited by hawkmoths, bats, hummingbirds and various diurnal insects, and all populations had similar rates of visitation. Nocturnal insects had the highest overall visitation rates (three times as high as those by diurnal insects). Fruit production varied among pollination treatments and populations, and significant differences were found in fruit production when flowers exposed to both diurnal and nocturnal visitation were compared to flowers exposed only to diurnal visitation. Our results and the bright-red staminal filaments of C. longipedicellata indicate lack of specialization for particular pollinators.

AB In primary lowland rain forest in Brunei Darussalam, we studied arboreal ant communities to evaluate whether densities and spacing of spatially territorial taxa along 2.9 km of well-studied trails are consistent with existence of a continuous mosaic of dominant ants. A median intercolony distance of 24.5 m, about twice or less distances over which colonies of most included species regularly ranged, suggested a relatively continuous mosaic. Despite relying on nesting sites in preformed plant cavities, carpenter ants contributed > 70 percent of mapped colonies. Most belonged to the Camponotus (Colobopsis) cylindricus (COCY) complex, including SE Asia's 'exploding' ants. Their lack of aggression against certain Polyrhachis species was associated with interspecific territory sharing by members of the two groups, and with a dominance-discovery trade-off. Experimental approaches yielded evidence for two putative contributors to positive association. Larger-bodied Polyrhachis parasitize food-finding abilities of smaller, more populous Camponotus workers, and the two taxa cooperate in territorial defense. Highly territorial and predatory weaver ants (Oecophylla smaragdina) were an important component of the ant mosaic in primary forest, second only to codominant COCY and Polyrhachis taxa. Members of the genus Crematogaster were significantly associated with Oecophylla in baiting censuses and regularly monopolized near-nest baits to the exclusion of weaver ants. Litter ant abundances differed between territories of Oecophylla and less predatory COCY species, but direction of difference was inconsistent over time. The densely packed mosaic of spatially territorial, and differentially predatory, taxa in Bornean rain forest likely contributes to spatial variation in ant effects on plant and arthropod communities.

AB Leaf-cutting ants (genera Atta and Acromyrmex) are considered dominant herbivores of Neotropical forests. However, so far quantitative, long-term, and large-scale assessments of their impact on these ecosystems are rare, because the available assessment methods were laborious and/or destructive. We describe a rapid, nondestructive, and inexpensive method to estimate the long-term harvest of Atta colombica colonies. Workers of A. colombica dump the colony refuse (exhausted fungal substrate) outside the nest. A single trail connects the refuse pile and the nest. In contrast to the foraging activity, the refuse deposition rate (the number of deposited refuse particles per minute) is diurnally constant and varies little on subsequent days. The number of refuse particles deposited per day was tightly correlated with the number of harvested fragments in nests of differing sizes (R-2 = 0.77, P < 0.0001). Therefore, the daily harvest of a particular colony can be calculated from short-term counts (5 min) of the refuse deposition rate at any time of the day. Combining these data with information on average fragment size (weight and/or area) allows the calculation of the total daily amount of biomass and/or foliage area harvested by the colony. This new method facilitates quantifying A. colombica herbivory on scales of populations and ecosystems, or over long-term scales.

AB Leaf-cutting ants are frequently characterized as the major herbivores in the Neotropics, but quantitative data to back up this assumption are scarce. In this study, the consumption and herbivory rates for the entire leaf-cutting ant (Atta colombica, Formicidae) population in an old secondary forest on Barro Colorado Island (BCI) in Panama were determined over 15 mo (on average 49 colonies). The number of harvested leaf fragments was calculated from monthly refuse deposition rates of the colonies and the regression between refuse deposition and harvesting rates. The inclusion of fragment characteristics (proportion of leaf fragments in the harvest, average fragment weight, and area) allowed us to calculate consumption and herbivory rates at colony, population, and ecosystem levels. The A. colombica population harvested 13.2 tons of biomass/yr and 13.1 ha of leaf area/yr, and deposited 9.4 tons of refuse material/yr. Rates varied considerably among colonies. At the ecosystem level, i.e., per forest area, herbivory rates were 132 kg biomass/ha/yr and 13 10 m(2) foliage/ha/yr. For the area on BCI where A. colombica occurs (100 ha), this is equivalent to 2.1 percent of the foliage area in the forest or 1.7 percent of the annual leaf-area production. This value is considerably lower than previously published estimates of leaf-cutting ant herbivory rates in tropical forests.

AB Edge-mediated changes in species composition are known to result in modified species interactions. Because of the crucial trophic position of herbivores and their far-reaching impact on plant communities, it is important to understand how edge influences herbivory. In the present paper, we investigated whether and how leaf-cutting ant foraging is altered in the forest edge, as this habitat is characterized by an increased proportion of pioneer species. We assessed basic foraging data as well as the herbivory rate (i.e., the proportion of the leaf material harvested by a colony in relation to the available leaf area in the foraging area) of Atta cephalotes colonies at the edge versus interior sites of a large remnant of the Atlantic forest in Northeast Brazil. Our results indicated clear edge effects on leaf-cutting ants: equally sized A. cephalotes colonies located at the forest edge removed about twice as much leaf area from their foraging grounds than interior colonies (14.3 vs. 7.8%/col/yr). This greater colony-level impact within the forest edge zone was a consequence of markedly reduced foraging areas (0.9 vs. 2.3 ha/col/yr) and moderately lower leaf area index in this habitat, whereas harvest rates were the same. Our results suggest that forest edges induce increased leaf-cutting ant herbivory, probably via the release of resource limitation. Together with the increase of leaf-cutting ant populations along forest edges, this may amplify environmental changes induced by habitat fragmentation.

AB Annual variation in the diet of adult spiny-tailed iguanas was studied by analyzing feces collected at 38 known iguana refuges in the desert of the southern Baja California peninsula. Iguanas consumed mostly plants, a small percentage of arthropods, their own skin, and remains from conspecifics. They consumed at least 22 of 83 plant species known to be present in the area. Leaves of three perennial Leguminosae species formed the year-round basis of their diet. Iguanas ate flowers and fruit when available. We propose that iguanas could be efficient seed dispersers for Cactaceae, but that they crush many of the seeds of leafy tree species. No significant differences in food consumption pattern were found between dry and rainy seasons. Iguanas apparently moved to neighboring trees only when searching for food. We propose that predation risk could have more influence than the nutritional value of plants on the species' foraging behavior and microhabitat selection in this area.

AB Structural and floristic components of vegetation and fruit production were examined to evaluate the relative importance of each vegetation aspect on patterns of habitat use and to determine whether differences in degree of frugivory would affect sensitivity of birds to vegetation components. Abundances of 12 bird species were quantified in four different habitat types in the Southeastern Atlantic rain forest of Brazil using captures with mist nets. Structural and floristic traits and fruit production were sampled within plots along the mist net lines. Best explanations for the variation in species abundance were obtained by different combinations of the vegetation components (generalized linear models, Akaike information criterion; R-2 mean values = 0.48, Delta AlCc = 0). Although each species had a particular preference for some vegetation variables, floristic components stood out in those relationships, generating models with a stronger explanatory capacity (R-2 > 0.40) and higher levels of empirical support (A AlCc = minimum values). The variation in bird sensitivities to the floristic component was associated with bird dependence on a fruit diet: there was a correlation between the explanatory capacity of models built with only floristic composition and a species' degree of frugivory (Spearman rank correlation, r = 0.66, P = 0.04), indicating that floristics had a higher effect in more frugivorous birds. For the other vegetation components, there was no clear pattern with statistical support. These results indicate that sensitivities of bird species to vegetation aspects are associated with their dependence on a fruit diet.

AB To assess the impact of bats on seed dispersal in a tropical mature forest (Nouragues, French Guiana), we conducted a bat exclusion experiment and tested the hypotheses that an artificial reduction in the abundance of bats would result in: (1) a decrease in seed species diversity, at the community level; and (2) an increase in seed limitation (a failure of seeds to reach all suitable sites for germination) at the species level. Seed rain was sampled in two contiguous forest plots for a total of 120 d, using 49 seed traps (I m(2)) arranged in 7 x 7 grids and spaced at 5-m intervals. Using mist nets, bat activity was reduced in one forest plot for a total of 60 nights. Thirty-nine plant species, or species groups, likely to be consumed and dispersed by bats, were collected within a total sample of 50,063 seeds. The overall seed rain was dominated by epiphytic Araceae and Cyclanthaceae (83.3%) and tree species within the genera Cecropia and Ficus (16.0%). Seeds from bat-dispersed shrubs and treelets (Piper, Solanum, and Vismia) were relatively rare (0.7%). The bat exclusion resulted in a 30.5 percent reduction in seed species richness and increased seed limitation for most of the species sampled. Seed limitation was caused mainly by a reduced seed rain (seed source limitation) rather than a decrease in seed dispersal uniformity (seed dispersal limitation). Therefore, bat-dispersed plants with low seed production are likely to be particularly affected by a decline in bat abundance, as a result of anthropogenic change.

AB Data are provided on the carrying capacity and potential production for sustainable human use of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and collared peccary (Pecari tajacu) in a protected tropical dry forest at Chamela on the Pacific coast of Mexico. In this paper, the carrying capacity was defined as the equilibrium density plus the number of animals removed by predators. The equilibrium point was estimated from the density dependent relationship between the finite population growth rate and the current density according to a logistic model. Annual density was estimated using the line transect method. Carrying capacity estimates were 16.5 to 17.2 deer/km(2) and 9-3-9. peccaries/km(2), representing a combined biomass of841-874 kg/km(2). A potential production for human use of 2. 1 deer/km(2) and 4.4 peccaries/km2 was estimated employing the model of Robinson and Redford (1991). The data Suggest that, in the protected tropical dry forest of Chamela, the density and biomass of wild ungulates can maintain a similar or greater density and biomass than other Neotropical forests. To obtain an accurate estimation of the maximum sustainable yield (MSY), it is necessary to consider predation. From a management point of view, it is important to consider that carrying capacity varies as a function of the rainfall pattern.

AB Change in lichen diversity is often used as a bioindicator to estimate effects of atmospheric pollution, but natural variation in lichen cover and species richness can be very, high. We examined the top-down effects of spore-consuming ants and the bottom-up effects of nutrient and light availability on lichen diversity associated with the leaf surface of the rain forest understory plant, Pz er cenocladum. Plots containing P. cenocladum were randomly assigned to treatments in factorial experiments that included high and low light levels, nutrient enrichment, and presence and absence of the ant mutualist, Pheidole bicornis. At the conclusion of the experiments, plants were harvested and size of leaves, secondary metabolite content (amides), epiphyll cover, and the species richness of the lichens (which comprised 85% of the epiphyll community) were quantified. Epiphyll cover (mosses, liverworts, and lichens) was greater on plants that had ant-mutualists and balanced resources. Lichen species richness was greater for plants with balanced resources, particularly for those with high light availability. Relationships between toxins and lichen cover and richness were weak and unclear. In this system, natural sources of variation were reliable determinants of lichen diversity and both biotic and abiotic influences were important.

   IDENTIFICATION
AB Some temperate wood-boring cerambycid beetles harbor intracellular gut yeasts believed to augment host nutrition, but species belonging to the subfamily Lamiinae are thought to lack endosymbionts. Almost 49 percent of Neotropical cerambycid species are lamiines, therefore, comparatively few rain forest species would be expected to host symbiotic gut yeasts. This study reports the isolation of gut yeasts from closely related Neotropical lamiines. We investigated species that feed on trees in the Brazil nut family (Lecythidaceae), because host plant associations are relatively well known. Our objectives were to determine if gut yeasts were present and, if possible, infer their mode of transmission. We collected and dissected 18 beetle specimens from three tree species, including 17 cerambycids and one curculionid. Every insect specimen yielded a gut yeast. DNA sequence libraries were used for a rapid identification of the yeasts and their larval hosts. The cerambycids included five lamiine species and one cerambycine. Six ascomycete yeasts were isolated from their guts; we found no evidence of strict vertical transmission. Larval gut yeasts were genetically similar to yeasts previously isolated from insects associated with wood or fungi, implying potential habitat specificity. The yeasts have not yet been localized, and potential function is not known, but they may contribute to rapid nutrient cycling or serve as the first line of defense against plant toxins.

AB Hoolock gibbons (Hoolock hoolock) are endangered small apes occurring in Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, and south China. All known populations have undergone declines primarily due to habitat destruction or alteration. We examined the influence of area of natural forests, area of plantations, area of agricultural land and edible plant species richness on the hoolock gibbon numbers from 22 sites in Bangladesh using multiple regression analysis. Area of natural forests and plantations were not linked to hoolock gibbon numbers, whereas area of agricultural land and edible plant species richness were both significantly linked. Higher edible plant species richness was directly related to hoolock gibbon numbers, while the area of agricultural land was inversely related. This is the first quantitative study illustrating the importance of these two variables with hoolock gibbon numbers. We also analyzed the existing habitat characteristics in two of the largest hoolock gibbon populations in Bangladesh: Lawachara (42 individuals) and Kaptai (84 individuals). Trees in Lawachara were generally smaller compared to those in Kaptai. Artocarpus, Tectona, and Dipterocarpus were the three most important genera in both sites, although Artocarpus was more important in Lawachara. Each site also had an abundant variety of tree species utilized by, hoolock gibbons for food. We discuss the current context of primate conservation in Bangladesh and suggest that the current conservation priority for gibbons in the country should be protection and improvement of habitat.

We found that both types of seed have reduced germination rates at low temperatures, and that ovoid seeds are photosensitive. In the discussion we present the possible implications of the findings for the understanding of the life history strategy of this species.

AB The leaf beetle Aplosonyx ancora cuts circular trenches on the underside of leaves of their aroid host plants before feeding. Latex is exuded from these cuts and the beetles feed intermittenly on these isolated tissues, apparently avoiding the latex. Circular feeding holes occur only in Araceae in which latex is contained in cells or vessels with cells bridging adjacent files ("anastomosing laticifers"). The phylogeny of Araceae and the restricted host records suggest a coevolutionary arms race and parallel phylogenesis between Aplosonyx and its aroid hosts.

We found a considerable interspecific variation in the reproductive fitness costs of herbivory in four African Acacia spp. Acacia nilotica and A. brevispica respond to protection from large mammalian herbivores by, greatly increasing their seed set. In contrast, there was little or no increase in seed set in A. mellifera and A. etbaica. The reasons for these differences are not known, but may be related to armament morphologies.

AB People have hunted mammals in tropical Asian forests for at least 40,000 yr. This period has seen one confirmed global extinction (the giant pangolin, Manis palaeojavanica) and range restrictions for several large mammals, but there is no strong evidence for unsustainable hunting pressure until the last 2000-3000 yr, when elephants, rhinoceroses, and several other species were progressively eliminated from the large parts of their ranges. Regional declines in most species have occurred largely within the last 50 yr. Recent subsistence hunting has typically focused on pigs and deer (hunted with dogs and spears or with snares), monkeys and other arboreal mammals (often caught with blowpipes), and porcupines and other rodents (smoked or dug out of burrows). Over the last 50 yr, the importance of hunting for subsistence has been increasingly outweighed by hunting for the market. The hunted biomass is dominated by the same species as before, sold mostly for local consumption, but numerous additional species are targeted for the colossal regional trade in wild animals and their parts for food, medicines, raw materials, and pets. Many populations of mammalian dispersers of large seeds and understory browsers have been depleted or eliminated, while seed predators have had a more variable fate. Most of this hunting is now illegal, but the law enforcement is generally weak. However, examples of successful enforcement show that hunting impacts can be greatly reduced where there is sufficient political will. Ending the trade in wild animals and their parts should have the highest regional conservation priority.

AB Vertebrate responses to hunting are widely variable for target and nontarget species depending on the history of hunting and productivity of any given site and the life history traits of game species. We provide a comprehensive meta-analysis of changes in population density or other abundance estimates for 30 mid-sized to large mammal, bird and reptile species in 101 hunted and nonhunted, but otherwise undisturbed, Neotropical forest sites. The data set was analyzed using both an unnested approach, based on population density estimates, and a nested approach in which pairwise comparisons of abundance metrics were restricted to geographic groups of sites sharing similar habitat and soil conditions. This resulted in 25 geographic clusters of sites within which 1811 population abundance estimates were compared across different levels of hunting pressure. Average nested changes in abundance across increasingly greater levels of hunting pressure ranged from moderately positive to highly negative. Populations of all species combined declined across greater differences in hunting pressure by up to 74.8 percent from their numeric abundance in less intensively hunted sites, but harvest-sensitive species faired far worse. Of the 30 species examined, 22 declined significantly at high levels of hunting. Body size significantly affected the direction and magnitude of abundance changes, with large-bodied species declining faster in overhunted sites. Frugivorous species showed more marked declines in abundance in heavily hunted sites than seed predators and browsers, regardless of the effects of body size. The implications of hunting for seed dispersal are discussed in terms of community dynamics in semi-defaunated tropical forests.

AB Mammal populations are increasingly hunted, yet the consequences of their disappearance from tropical forests have only recently been explored. Here, we summarize current research on the role of mammals in seed dispersal and postdispersal processes, such as seed predation and secondary dispersal, in different tropical regions. We evaluate how mammal features influence seedshadows and ultimately forest regeneration. Finally, we discuss the potential effect of changes in seedshadows caused by the elimination of many medium- and large-sized mammals. The complex role that mammals play in creating and modifying seedshadows in tropical forests cannot be easily quantified, and in this review we emphasize the variation that exists both within and among mammal taxa and across continents. To bridge this gap in information, we suggest that more studies should evaluate the relative importance of the disappearance of both seed dispersers and seed predators for particular plant species so that we may begin to understand the balance between these two influences. We also suggest that future studies identify ecological redundancy in nonhunted vertebrates within any particular community to evaluate compensatory behavior that may help ameliorate some of the negative effects of hunting of large and medium mammals.

AB Many of the mammals undergoing drastic declines in tropical forests worldwide are important seed dispersers and seed predators, and thus changes in mammal communities due to hunting will affect plant recruitment. It has been hypothesized that larger-seeded species will suffer greater reductions in seed removal and thus greater increases in predispersal seed predation than smaller-seeded species. We compared primary and secondary seed removal and predispersal seed predation of two tree species between hunted and nonhunted sites in Central Panama. Seeds of Oenocarpus mapora (Arecaceae) are 16-times greater in size than those of Cordia bicolor (Boraginaceae). We quantified primary seed removal and predispersal seed predation using seed traps, and we assessed secondary seed removal using seed removal plots. Primary removal of C. bicolor was 43 percent lower in the hunted sites, while primary removal of O. mapora was not significantly different. Secondary removal of unprotected O. mapora seeds on the ground was 59 percent lower in hunted sites, while secondary removal of C. bicolor was not significantly different. Predispersal seed predation of O. mapora by mammals was significantly lower in hunted sites, while predispersal seed predation by insects was not significantly different in either species. In combination with other studies, our results suggest that seed size is not a reliable predictor of the impacts of hunting. Mammal defaunation differentially affects stages and modes of seed dispersal and seed predation of different plant species, suggesting that these influences are complex and related to multiple plant traits.

AB Throughout the tropics, mammalian seed dispersers are being driven to local extinction by intense hunting pressure, generating concern not only about the loss of these species, but also about the consequences for the plants they disperse. We compared two rain forest sites in Cameroon-one with heavy hunting pressure and one protected from hunting-to appraise the loss of mammalian seed dispersers and to assess the impact of this loss on seed removal and seed dispersal of Antrocaryon klaineanum (Anacardiaceae), a mammal-dispersed tree. Surveys of arboreal frugivores indicate that three of the five monkey species, as well as chimpanzee and gorilla, have been extirpated from the hunted forest. Diaspore counts underneath A. klaineanum adults (six trees per site) indicate that seed removal is severely reduced in the hunted forest. Finally, genetic maternity exclusion analysis (using 3-7 nuclear microsatellite loci) of maternally inherited endocarp tissue from diaspores collected under the canopies of 12 fruiting "mother" trees (six trees per site) revealed that seed dispersal in the hunted forest is also greatly reduced. In the hunted forest with reduced mammal dispersal agents, only 1 of the 53 assayed endocarps (2%) did not match the mother and was determined to be from a dispersed diaspore. By contrast, in the protected forest, 20 of the 48 assayed endocarps (42%) were from dispersed diaspores. This study provides strong evidence that loss of dispersal agents can lead to reduced seed removal and loss of seed dispersal, disrupting the seed dispersal cycle.

AB In Neotropical forests, large fruit-eating primates play important ecological roles as dispersal agents of large seeds. Bushmeat hunting threatens to disrupt populations of primates and large-seeded trees. We test the hypothesis that otherwise intact Neotropical forests with depressed populations of large primates experience decline in recruitment of large-seeded trees. We quantify the proportion of small juveniles (> 0.5 m tall-1 cm diameter at breast height, DBH) of large primate-dispersed tree species found underneath heterospecifc trees that are also dispersed by large primates at two protected sites in Manu National Park and one hunted site outside Manu N.P. in southeastern Peru. The forests are comparable in edaphic and climatic qualities, successional stage, and adult tree species composition. We found that hunting locally exterminates populations of large primates, and reduced primates of intermediate body size (hereafter "medium primates") by 80 percent. Moreover, tree species richness was 55 percent lower and density of species dispersed by large and medium-bodied primates 60 percent lower in hunted than in protected sites. In addition, richness and density of abiotically dispersed species and plants dispersed by non-game animals are greater in hunted sites. Overhunting threatens to disrupt the ecological interactions between primates and the plants that rely on them for seed dispersal and recruitment. Sustainable wildlife management plans are urgently needed, because protected areas are at risk of becoming "island" parks if buffer zones become empty of animals and have impoverished flora.

AB Hunting and habitat loss represent an increasingly common anthropogenic impact. Available evidence suggests that defaunation is typically differential: medium/large mammals are most affected while small rodents are less affected, or even favored. In heavily impacted areas, such as Los Tuxtlas, the residual mammalian fauna is dominated by small rodents. We tested the expectation that if small rodents will preferentially attack small-seeded species, large-seeded species may escape predation in the absence of medium/large seed predators and that this may affect germination and, possibly, recruitment. Experiments with caged rodents (Heteromys desmarestianus) under laboratory conditions showed a preference for smaller seeds. A field experiment involving seeds of contrasting size showed that small, unprotected seeds experienced a predation risk 30-times larger than protected seeds, while the effect of protection was not significant for large seeds. These patterns of predation led to significant differences in germination: protected small-seeded species had a fourfold greater germination than unprotected small-seeded species, while germination was not significantly different between exposed and protected large seeds. The observed contrasts in germination suggest that under heavy defaunation, small-seeded species are likely to be penalized by the overabundance of small rodents, while large-seeded species escape predation. Our results are consistent with the observation of dense seedling carpets dominated by large-seeded species in the understory of Los Tuxtlas. We speculate that the patterns we uncovered may explain, at least partly, the impoverished diversity of the understory vegetation that characterizes heavily defaunated understories and that this has the potential to affect forest regeneration.

AB We evaluated predictions that hunters favor lianas, large seeds, and seeds dispersed by bats, small birds, and mechanical means for seedling banks in central Panama. We censused 3201 trees in 20 1-ha plots and 38,250 seedlings in the central 64 m(2) of each plot. We found significant differences in the species composition of the seedling bank between nine protected sites in the Barro Colorado Nature Monument and 11 hunted sites in the contiguous Parque Nacional Soberania. Lianas, species with large seeds, and species with seeds dispersed by bats, small birds, and mechanical means were all overrepresented at hunted sites. The latter two findings could also be evaluated relative to the species composition of reproductively mature adults for canopy trees. The tree species present in the seedling bank had significantly heavier seeds than the tree species present as adults at hunted sites but not at protected sites. The representation of seed dispersal modes among the species present in the seedling bank did not reflect pre-existing differences in the local species composition of adults. We hypothesize that hunting large seed predators favors large seeds by reducing predation and increasing survival. We also hypothesize that the harvest of large birds and mammals that disperse many seeds favors other species whose seeds are dispersed by bats, small birds, and mechanical means. This process also favors lianas because the seeds of disproportionate numbers of liana species are dispersed by wind.

AB Hunting can change abundances of vertebrate seed predators and seed dispersers, causing species-specific changes in seed dispersal and seed predation and altering seedling communities. What are the consequences of these changes for the adult plant community in the next generation and beyond ? Here, I derive equations showing how reduced seed dispersal reduces plant reproduction by intensifying kin competition, increasing vulnerability to natural enemies, and reducing the proportion of seeds passing through disperser guts. I parameterize these equations with available empirical data to estimate the likely effects on next-generation abundances. I then consider the indirect effects and longer-term feedbacks of changed seed or adult abundances on reproductive rates due to density-dependent interactions with natural enemies and mutualists, as well as niche differentiation with competitors, and discuss their likely qualitative effects. The factors limiting seed disperser and seed predator populations in natural and hunted forests emerge as critical for determining the long-term effects of hunting on rates of seed dispersal and seed predation. For example, where seed dispersers are held to a constant abundance by hunters, decreases in the availability of their preferred food plants are expected to lead to increased per-seed dispersal probabilities, potentially to the point of compensating for the initial disperser decline. I close by discussing the likely reversibility of hunting-induced changes in tropical forests and key questions and directions for future research.

AB This synthesis builds on the preceding articles of this Special Section and has three goals. We first review the nascent literature that addresses indirect effects of hunting for tropical forest plant communities. Next, we highlight the potential indirect effects of hunting for other groups of organisms. Our final goal is to consider what could be done to ameliorate the demographic threats to harvest-sensitive game species caused by unsustainable hunting. Three conclusions are possible at this time concerning the impact of hunting for tropical forest plant communities: (1) Hunting tends to reduce seed movement for animal-dispersed species with very large diaspores; (2) Hunting reduces seed predation by granivorous vertebrates for species with large seeds; and (3) Hunting alters the species composition of the seedling and sapling layers. The cascading effects of hunting are already known to affect bruchid beetles and dung beetles and are likely to affect other, nongame taxa. To ameliorate these problems, several lines of research should be further explored to facilitate the development of game management plans including: (1) alternative use of sources of animal protein; (2) income supplementation for local people from sources other than wild meat; (3) outreach and extension activities for communities; (4) recognition and facilitation of the shifting of attitudes towards hunting; (5) implementation of community-based wildlife management programs in regulated-use areas such as extractive reserves; and (6) landscape-scale conservation planning that maximizes the source-sink dynamics of harvested and unharvested game populations and enforces game regulations in strictly protected areas.

AB Lianas impose intense resource competition for light in the upper forest canopy by displaying dense foliage on top of tree crowns. Using repeated access with a construction crane, we studied the patterns of canopy colonization of the lianas Combretum fruticosum and Bonamia trichantha in a Neotropical dry forest in Panama. Combretum fruticosum flushed leaves just before the rainy season, and its standing leaf area quickly reached a peak in the early rainy season (May-June). In contrast, B. trichantha built up foliage area continuously throughout the rainy season and reached a peak in the late rainy season (November). Both species displayed the majority of leaves in full sun on the canopy surface, but C. fruticosum displayed a greater proportion of leaves (26%) in more shaded microsites than B. trichantha (12%). Self-shading within patches of liana leaves within the uppermost 40-50 cm of the canopy reduced light levels measured with photodiodes placed directly on leaves to 4-9 percent of light levels received by sun leaves. Many leaves of C. fruticosum acclimated to shade within a month following the strongly synchronized leaf flushing and persisted in deep shade. In contrast, B. trichantha produced short-lived leaves opportunistically in the sunniest locations. Species differences in degree of shade acclimation were also evident in terms of structural (leaf mass per area, and leaf toughness) and physiological characters (nitrogen content, leaf life span, and light compensation point). Contrasting leaf phenologies reflect differences in light exploitation and canopy colonization strategies of these two liana species.

AB Nitrogen-fixing epiphytes (especially lichens with a cyanobacterial symbiont-cyanolichens) have the potential to contribute significant amounts of nitrogen (N) to montane tropical forests, which are typically low in N-but the factors controlling the abundance and distribution of epiphytic cyanolichens are poorly understood. In long-term fertilization experiments in montane forests on a 4.1 million-yr-old Oxisol on the island of Kaua'i and on a 152-yr-old lava flow on the island of Hawai'i, the epiphytic cyanolichen Pseudocyphellaria crocata increased significantly in abundance in canopies of host trees fertilized with phosphorus (P). There was no response to fertilization with N or other essential elements. Nitrogen-fixation rates were also elevated in lichens in P-fertilized plots at both sites. Phosphorus supply to host trees may be an important factor controlling N inputs to montane tropical forests by N-fixing epiphytes.

AB Recent studies suggest that tropical tree species exhibit low inbreeding and high gene dispersal levels despite the typically low density of conspecifics in tropical forests. To examine this, we undertook a study of pollen gene dispersal and mating system of two Amazonian tree species. We analyzed 341 seeds from 33 trees at four microsatellite loci in a Carapa guianensis population from Brazil, and 212 seeds from 22 trees at four microsatellite loci in a Sextonia rubra population from French Guiana. Differentiation of allele frequencies among the pollen pool of individual trees was Phi(FT) = 0.053 (95% CI: 0.027-0.074) for C. guianensis and Phi(FT) = 0.064 (95% CI: 0.017-0.088) for S. rubra. The mean pollen dispersal distances were estimated at 69-355 m for C. guianensis, and 86-303 m for S. rubra, depending on the pollen dispersal model and the estimate of reproductive tree density used. The multi-locus outcrossing rate was estimated at 0.918 and 0.945, and the correlation of paternity at 0.089 and 0.096, for C. guianensis and S. rubra, respectively, while no significant levels of biparental inbreeding were detected. Comparing trees with high and low local density of conspecifics, we found no evidence for differences in inbreeding levels. The results are discussed within the framework of the emerging picture of the reproductive biology of tropical forest trees.

AB Seedlings of five species of dipterocarp trees were planted in experimental plots in rain forest gaps in Sabah, Malaysia, and the rates of herbivory on their mature leaves recorded over 6 mo. A novel method was used to estimate the feeding pressure exerted by the local insect herbivore community, derived from the relative abundances of the dominant generalist herbivores and their feeding preferences. Characteristics of the leaves related to their defense and nutritional value were measured-phenolic content, laminar fracture toughness, laminar thickness, and nitrogen content. Three main groups of herbivorous insects were present-coleopteran and lepidopteran herbivores, which were sampled by hand from the seedlings, and orthopteran herbivores, which were sampled by sweep netting. The feeding preferences of the main coleopteran and orthopteran herbivores were determined using laboratory feeding trials. Combining variables in a Principal Components Analysis, a clear separation was found between the five seedling species along the first extracted component. This correlated closely with herbivory rates between species. The first extracted component comprised a negative influence of phenolic content and positive effects of nitrogen content, laminar fracture toughness, abundances of coleopteran and lepidopteran herbivores, and estimated feeding pressure of the coleopteran community. Further studies are required to determine the potential applications of the latter measure of estimated herbivore community impact.

AB The spatial distributions of many tropical arboreal ant species are often arranged in a mosaic such that dominant species have mutually exclusive distributions among trees. These dominant species can also mediate the structure of the rest of the arboreal ant community. Little attention has been paid to how diet might shape the effects of dominant species on one another and the rest of the ant community. Here, we take advantage of new information on the diets of many tropical arboreal ant species to examine the intra- and inter-guild effects of dominant species on the spatial distribution of one another and the rest of the tropical arboreal ant community in a cocoa farm in Bahia, Brazil. Using null model analyses, we found that all ant species, regardless of dominance status or guild membership, co-occur much less than expected by chance. Surprisingly, the suite of five dominant species showed random co-occurrence patterns, suggesting that interspecific competition did not shape their distribution among cocoa trees. Across all species, there was no evidence that competition shaped co-occurrence patterns within guilds. Co-occurrence patterns of subordinant species were random on trees with dominant species, but highly nonrandom on trees without dominant species, suggesting that dominant species disassemble tropical arboreal ant communities. Taken together, our results highlight the often complex nature of interactions that structure species-rich tropical arboreal ant assemblages.

AB Regeneration of forest canopy trees can be inhibited by understory thickets. We hypothesized that Isoglossa woodii, a large-leaved herbaceous plant, limits tree recruitment in subtropical coastal dune forests by providing habitat to fruit and seedling consumers. Using uncaged and caged treatments in I. woodii gaps and thickets, we found that frugivore and herbivore behavior is not influenced by I. woodii. We conclude that direct effects of I. woodii on postemergence processes in seedlings contribute to tree recruitment limitation.

ID AMPHIBIAN DECLINES
AB Many animals, plants, and microorganisms are harmed by ultraviolet-B radiation. In particular, several members of class amphibia are negatively affected by exposure to ultraviolet-B radiation. Exposure to ultraviolet-B radiation can cause death or various types of sublethal damage in amphibians. One mechanism to lessen the effect of harmful ultraviolet-B radiation is to limit exposure to sunlight behaviorally. Few studies have examined the behavioral sensitivity of adult amphibians to ultraviolet-B radiation. Using both field experiments and field observations, we found that two species of diurnal poison-dart frogs in Costa Rica (Dendrobates pumilio, D. auratus) consistently preferred areas in the field and within experimental testing chambers that offered low levels of ultraviolet-B radiation. In field observations, vocalizing D. pumilio were found at locations with significantly lower levels of ambient ultraviolet-B compared to random locations throughout their natural habitat. Ultraviolet-B avoidance behavior may be an important behavioral response for tropical frogs in light of recent evidence suggesting a significant increase in the levels of ambient ultraviolet-B radiation in the tropics over the past decade.

AB Although flying foxes (fruit bats in the genus Pteropus) in continental forests often fly between scattered resources, little is known about their ranging behavior among islands. The inhospitable water matrix that surrounds the food patches (islands) in archipelagos may prevent flying foxes from tracking resources as efficiently as their counterparts on larger landmasses do. Our aim in this study was to determine whether the abundance of foraging flying foxes (Pteropus tonganus) reflected food availability on islands in the Vava'u archipelago of Tonga, regardless of island size and isolation. Overall, food availability was the strongest determinant of flying fox abundance, and spatial aspects of the islands (land area within 10 km) had only a small influence. Food availability appears to regulate flying fox abundance only when food resources are low, but when food sources are plentiful, flying fox abundance may be high or low. These results provide indirect evidence that flying foxes are able to track food resources efficiently in an archipelago, and the water matrix that surrounds the food patches (islands) is not a strong deterrent for foraging animals.

AB A soil charcoal survey was undertaken across 60,000 ha of closed-canopy tropical forest in central Guyana to determine the occurrence, ubiquity, and age of past forest fires across a range of terra firme soil types. Samples were clustered around six centers consisting of spatially nested sample stations. Most charcoal was found between 40 and 60 cm depth with fewest samples yielding material at 0-20 cm depth. The first core yielded charcoal at most stations. Charcoal ages of a random subsample ranged from less than 200 YBP to 9500 YBP with a noticeable peak between 1000 and 1250 YBP. Results reinforce a view that most closed-canopy tropical forests in eastern Amazonia have been subject to palaeo-fire events of unknown severity with a peak in charcoal age consistently appearing between 1000 and 2000 YBP. The two samples dated to the early Holocene represent some of the oldest indicators of paleo-fire known from upland Neotropical forest soils. Ubiquitous soil charcoal in central Guyana further indicate both forest resilience to fire and the widespread propensity for regional forests to burn, particularly during anomalous periods of drought.

AB Seasonal patterns of tree growth are often related to rainfall, temperature, and relative moisture regimes. We asked whether diameter growth of mangrove trees in Micronesia, where seasonal changes are minimal, is continuous throughout a year or conforms to an annual cycle. We installed dendrometer bands on Sonneratia alba and Bruguiera gymnorrhiza trees growing naturally within mangrove swamps on the islands of Kosrae, Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), Pohnpei, FSM, and Butaritari, Republic of Kiribati, in the eastern Caroline Islands of the western Pacific Ocean. Trees were remeasured monthly or quarterly for as long as 6 yr. Annual mean individual tree basal area increments ranged from 7.0 to 79.6 cm(2)/yr for all S. alba trees and from 4.8 to 27.4 cm(2)/yr for all B. gymnorrhiza trees from Micronesian high islands. Diameter increment for S. alba on Butaritari Atoll was lower at 7.8 cm(2)/yr for the one year measured. Growth rates differed significantly by hydrogeomorphic zone. Riverine and interior zones maintained up to seven times the annual diameter growth rate of fringe forests, though not on Pohnpei, where basal area increments for both S. alba and B. gymnorrhiza were approximately 1.5 times greater in the fringe zone than in the interior zone. Time-series modeling indicated that there were no consistent and statistically significant annual diameter growth patterns. Although rainfall has some seasonality in some years on Kosrae and Pohnpei and overall growth of mangroves was sometimes related positively to quarterly rainfall depths, seasonal diameter growth patterns were not distinctive. A reduced chance of moisture-related stress in high-rainfall, wetland environments may serve to buffer growth of Micronesian mangroves from climatic extremes.

AB The community composition and percent cover of vascular epiphytes were examined in relation to photosynthetic photon flux density (PFD), temperature, vapor pressure, and tree characteristics in the inner-crown of two emergent tree species, Hyeronima alchorneoides and Lecythis ampla, at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. A total of 53 species were found in a total sampled branch area of 32 m(2) in eight trees-four trees per species. Community composition varied both among individuals of the same tree species and between tree species. However, percent cover patterns of vascular epiphytes were significantly different between the two tree species; Hyeronima had a significantly greater percent cover of epiphytes than Lecythis. The higher percent light transmittance as well as lower humidity in Lecythis are likely causes of its lower percent cover of epiphytes.

AB Thigmomorphogenesis includes the effects of mechanical perturbation on plant growth. To test whether thigmomorphogenesis is evident at different scales within plants, we investigated the effect of wind on allometric relationships between specific plant parts. We chose two species from the elfin cloud forest of Puerto Rico that have contrasting growth habits, the shrub Clibadiun erosum (Asteraceae) and the palm Prestoea acuminata var. montana (Arecaceae), and subjected them to barrier-protected and wind-exposed treatments. For C. erosum, we compared the allometry of stems and branches against three allometric models that predict that plant height or branch length increases at the 1, 2/3, and 1/2 power of stem diameter. Only the geometric similarity model (scaling exponent of 1) seemed to hold when plants were exposed to the wind. We found relatively fewer leaves per number of branches produced and fewer leaves per increment of branch diameter in the plants of C. erosum exposed to the wind. Mean petiole length ratios (petiole length/basal radius) of P. acuminata were higher on leaves of barrier-protected plants for both simple and compound leaves, indicating that petioles were stouter and mechanically safer in the wind-exposed plants. We suggest that alteration of the allometric relationships of plant parts, organs, or plant modules (stems and branches of C. erosum and leaves of P. acuminata) and alteration of the number of plant parts (leaves and branches of C. erosum) are adaptive responses resulting from the mechanical perturbation induced by wind in the elfin forest.

AB We examined the impact of substrate, population density, and sexual composition on female reproductive success in harvested populations of the tropical understory palm Chamaedorea radicalis. Leaf harvest for the international floral greenery trade does not kill palms, but has been shown to reduce flowering frequency and has been projected to reduce population growth. Because C. radicalis is dioecious and wind-pollinated, a reduction in flowering density from leaf harvest or other anthropogenic factors may lower pollen movement between flowering conspecifics and lower fruit production. Such reduced fecundity in harvested populations can contribute to an Allee effect, where the per capita rate of population growth declines at low density. We tested for these effects by sampling C. radicalis along transects in ten populations, spanning a range of densities, during May (flowering peak) and August (fruiting peak) 2002. We applied path analysis using structural equation modeling (SEM) to test a set of hypothesized relationships between substrate, female size, several population parameters, and female fecundity. SEM models revealed that female fecundity was not dependent on any measure of population density or sexual composition, providing no evidence for an Allee effect. The strongest model (R-2 = 92.9%) related C. radicalis reproductive output only to substrate, female size, flower number, and proportional fruit set. This model revealed that palms on rock outcrops were larger, produced more flowers, and had higher proportional fruit set than palms on the forest floor. This finding suggests that protection of females on outcrops should enhance population growth and viability.

AB Understanding phenology in plant populations requires distinction between proximate mechanisms and ultimate (evolutionary) causation. Leaf production and abscission, flower production, and herbivory were monitored for 2 yr in a population of the stem succulent tree, Plumeria alba L. in the Guanica State Forest in southwest Puerto Rico. Dependence of phenological events on abiotic (rainfall and day length) and biotic factors (herbivore abundance/damage) was quantified to discern potential relationships. Leaf flush and flowering were not associated with periods of highest rainfall as might be expected in a dry tropical forest. Rather, these events were highly correlated with day length. We observed that most leaf flush began in March and April, which was several months before the wettest period of the year (August to November). This result is consistent with other studies that show that leaf flush in Plumeria is under photoperiodic control and that the plants initiate growth and reproduction when cloudiness is low and seasonal light availability is greatest. Herbivore damage by caterpillars of the sphinx moth Pseudosphinx tetrio is restricted primarily to the wettest season, consistent with the hypothesis that early leaf flush and reproduction has been selected to avoid herbivory. It is not clear whether photoperiodic control of leaf flush and reproduction serves to maximize seasonal light availability, minimize the impact of herbivores, or both. However, it is clear that peak rainfall is not likely to have been the sole selective factor determining leaf flush and flowering in P. alba.

AB Tropical cloud forests are functionally important ecosystems, but are severely threatened due to deforestation and fragmentation. Epiphyte mats, accumulations of live vegetation and dead organic matter on tree trunks and branches, are a conspicuous component of cloud forests and harbor diverse assemblages of meso- and microarthropods. We compared the morphospecies richness, composition, and abundance of arthropods in epiphyte mats between primary and secondary forests of Monteverde, Costa Rica, and at two nearby replicate sites. Epiphyte mats were thinner and less structurally diverse in secondary forest. We collected ca 36,000 micro- and mesoarthropods from epiphyte mats in the 2-yr study. Whereas arthropod morphospecies richness did not differ among forest types, arthropod abundance was significantly higher in secondary forest due to larger numbers of ants, especially Solenopsis spp. Arthropod assemblages showed a high degree of taxonomic overlap both within and between primary and secondary forests (Jaccard abundance-based similarity = 0.93-0.96). Although characteristics of the arthropod fauna proved to be similar among sites and between forest types, there was a significant temporal effect: arthropod morphospecies richness in epiphyte mats generally was lower in the dry season (February-May), when many taxa probably became dormant or sought shelter against desiccation in deeper portions of mats.

AB Fallen branches, logs, and exposed roots (fallen branches hereafter) commonly form part of the trunk trail system of leaf-cutting ants that inhabit the tropical rain forest. We studied the role of fallen branches on resource discovering and on leaf transport rates in Atta cephalotes. Fallen branches were common components of the A. cephalotes trail system; they were present in all the nests, and in the majority of the trunk trails examined (13/16). A field experiment revealed that, at the beginning of their foraging activity, ants discovered food sources located at the end of fallen branches earlier than those located on the leaf litter. Additionally, laden ants walked faster along a fallen branch than along soil tracks of the trunk trails. This increment in speed was higher in slow-walking ants (e.g., with larger loads) than in fast-walking ants (e.g., with smaller loads). These results suggest that the presence of fallen branches may direct the searching effort of leaf-cutters and increase the foraging speed of laden ants when these structures are part of the trunk trail system. The advantages of using fallen branches as part of a trail system, and their potential consequences in the spatial foraging pattern of leaf-cutting ants, are discussed.

AB Both the uloborid Philoponella vicina and the araneid Gasteracantha cancriformis spiders sometimes placed silk stabilimenta on non-orb "resting webs" that consisted of only one or a few lines. These webs completely lacked sticky silk, so their stabilimenta could not function to attract prey. Some non-orbs were built by spiders when their orb webs are damaged. These observations contradict the prey attraction camouflage hypothesis for stabilimentum function, but are compatible with the spider camouflage and web advertisement to avoid web destruction hypotheses.

AB Two common South American species of lynx spiders, Peucetia rubrolineata and P. flava (Oxyopidae), were surveyed on three localities in southeastern Brazil to determine plant choice. Both species were found to be associated with plants bearing glandular trichomes. A literature review and complementary data show that ten Peucetia species are associated with up to 55 plant species bearing glandular trichomes in at least 20 distinct vegetation types (phytophysiognomies) in more than 36 localities in the Neotropical, Neartic, Afrotropical, and Paleartic regions. The main plant families used by the spiders were Solanaceae, Asteraceae, and Melastomataceae. The specialization of the Peucetia species for plants bearing glandular trichomes may have evolved because insects adhered to these sticky structures may be used as prey by the spiders.

AB Aggregation patterns of plants vary according to spatial scale and developmental stage, and are dependent on vegetation dynamics and species composition. We describe the aggregation patterns of the epiphytic orchid Psychilis monensis from two sites with different vegetation structure and composition on Mona Island, Puerto Rico. We analyzed spatial variation for seedlings, juveniles, and adults using the density-independent, standardized Morisita index (I-MS). We censused a total of 879 plants. Strong preferences for some phorophyte species were evident, including dead trees, but association with bark roughness was equivocal. The highest densities occurred in the site with the lowest fruit and seed production, suggesting that the best sites for pollination and seedling establishment were not the same. Seedlings at one site were significantly aggregated, but all other stages were indistinguishable from a random distribution. Nevertheless, adults at both sites had the lowest I-MS values indicating that they tend to be the least aggregated of the three life history stages. The abundance and age structure of P. monensis were clearly affected by the frequency of their preferred hosts, but site-specific factors affecting seedling survival probably play a major role in site differences.

AB This study describes the foraging ecology of birds during summer and winter in two different types of coffee agroecosystems in Chiapas, Mexico. Avian foraging behavior is documented in two agroecosystems of differing management intensity, structurally similar but with different levels of floristic diversity, during summer and winter seasons. The distribution of tree species used by birds was more even, and birds used a greater diversity of tree species, in the more diverse coffee shade system. Much of the variation in resource use derived from shifts in the use of flowers and fruit, highlighting the importance in resource phenology for birds. Insectivory was more frequent in winter than summer for the coffee layer, and in summer for the shade layer. Given the vegetative structural similarity of the two coffee agroecosystems included in this study, floristic differences probably accounted for much of the difference in the bird communities between the management systems, especially given the strong seasonal response to flowering and fruiting. This work suggests that plentiful and diverse food resources associated with the high diversity of plant species may facilitate coexistence of the high number of bird species found in shade-grown coffee agroecosystems.

AB Diet and habitat use of the closely related and size-overlapping sympatric Cynopterus brachyotis and C. sphinx were established in lowland dry evergreen forest, Thailand, between March 1998 and March 2000. Feces from netted bats were analyzed, and the recapture rate determined. Although both species share a set of food plants, and fruits from early successional forest contribute about half of their diet, C. brachyotis, the smaller of the two species, ate a significantly greater proportion of fruits from early successional forest than C. sphinx. The latter ate a significantly greater proportion of fruit species in larger size classes. More C. brachyotis were captured in early successional forest in almost every month, while C. sphinx is more common in old-growth forest. However, the capture rate of C. sphinx increased in early successional forest in the mid-dry season when its preferred fruits become available. The recapture rate of C. brachyotis in early successional forest was significantly higher than that of C. sphinx, and the reverse situation was observed in old-growth forest. Male C. sphinx had a significantly higher recapture rate in early successional forest than females. Fruit size and habitat use are the major determinants of resource partitioning between these size-overlapping congeners.

AB Chestnut short-tailed bats, Carollia castanea, and Seba's short-tailed bats, C. perspicillata (Phyllostomidae), were radio-tracked (N = 1593 positions) in lowland rain forest at Tiputini Biodiversity Station, Orellana Province, Ecuador. For 11 C. castanea, mean home range was 6.8 +/- 2.2 ha, mean core-use area was 1.7 +/- 0.8 ha, and mean long axis across home range was 438 +/- 106 m. For three C. perspicillata, mean home range was 5.5 +/- 1.7 ha, mean core-use area was 1.3 +/- 0.6 ha, and mean long axis was 493 +/- 172 m. Groups of less than five C. castanea occupied day-roosts in earthen cavities that undercut banks the Tiputini River. Carollia perspicillata used tree hollows and buildings as day-roosts. Interspecific and intraspecific overlap among short-tailed bats occurred in core-use areas associated with clumps of fruiting Piper hispidum (peppers) and Cecropia sciadophylla. Piper hispidum seeds were present in 80 percent of the fecal samples from C. castanea and 56 percent of samples from C. perspicillata. Carollia perspicillata handled pepper fruits significantly faster than C. castanea; however, C. castanea commenced foraging before C. perspicillata emerged from day-roosts. Evidence for exploitative competition between C. castanea and C. perspicillata is suggested by our observations that 95 percent of ripe P. hispidum fruits available at sunset disappear before sunrise (N = 74 marked fruits). Piper hispidum plants produced zero to 12 ripe infructescences per plant each night during peak production. Few ripe infructescences of P. hispidum were available during the dry season; however, ripe infructescences of C. sciadophylla, remained abundant.

AB Many animals can adjust their behavioral strategies to reduce predation risk. We investigated whether rain forest monkeys and duikers alter their antipredatory behavior in response to hunting by humans in southwestern Gabon. We compared monkey and duiker responses to human observers in an area where hunting is prohibited, to those in a nearby area where hunting pressure is moderate but spatially variable. The results of our study indicate that monkeys become more secretive when hunted, commencing alarm calls only when at a certain distance (typically > 50 m) from humans. We found no difference in monkey group size between hunted and no-hunting areas. In no-hunting areas, duikers often freeze in response to approaching observers, but in hunted areas they abandon this strategy and rapidly flee from humans. Duikers also whistle more often in areas where they are hunted frequently. Our findings have at least two important implications. First, behavioral observations of monkeys and duikers may be useful in gauging local hunting intensity in African rain forests. Second, duiker densities are likely to be overestimated in hunted areas, where they more readily flee and whistle, and underestimated in no-hunting areas, where they rely on freezing behavior to avoid detection. Because behavioral adaptations to hunting vary both among species and localities, these differences should be considered when attempting to derive population-density estimates for forest wildlife.

AB In this work, we report the predicted distribution of the threatened fluminense swallowtail butterfly, Parides ascanius (Cramer 1775), and correlate it to the presence of urban and protected areas within its range. The distribution was modeled using a genetic algorithm. The predicted distribution of the fluminense swallowtail shows high agreement within Rio de Janeiro state, in a near-continuous strip of 2,038,253 ha along the coastal lowlands, 17.8 percent of which is within urban areas. Only 8.7 percent (178,187 ha) of the remaining (nonurban) predicted model overlapped at least partially with protected areas (19 in all). Almost half of these protected areas also overlapped with urban areas, resulting in an additional loss of 58,751 ha. In seven of 19 protected areas, the distribution of P. ascanius was predicted by less than 50 percent of the models; five of the remaining protected areas are less restrictive reserves. Despite the wide distribution predicted by the models, only two of the observed occurrence points matched the predicted distribution within protected areas. Modeling threatened species distribution is a useful tool for highlighting gaps in networks of protected areas and should aid in planning to fill these gaps. However, in several developing countries with high biodiversity, there is insufficient basic biological information for many threatened species. In these cases, prospecting field studies are urgently needed.

AB We studied the effect of forest gaps and cattle grazing on survival and growth of seedlings of seven native tree species, planted in dry forest fragments with different intensities of past logging in Central Brazil. Seedling survival after 12 mo ranged from 35 to 77 percent among species. Survival of most species was similar in gaps and understory in minimally disturbed forest remnants, but was lower in the gaps of more heavily logged forests. In contrast, growth was much higher in gaps than in understory in minimally disturbed forests, but for most species was similar in gaps and understory in more heavily logged forests. We did not detect an effect of cattle on seedling survival. Seedlings of the most commonly logged species show a high potential to survive and grow when planted in logged forests.

AB The obligate interaction between figs and their pollinating wasps is often cited as an extraordinary example of reciprocal species specificity and evolutionary cospeciation. However, recent studies have shown that breakdowns in one-to-one specificity are not rare (30-60% of species depending on the locality). Combined with evidence of hybridization in some species, this led researchers to propose that a better evolutionary model was one of groups of genetically well-defined pollinators coevolving with groups of frequently hybridizing figs. Nevertheless, these recent studies still indicate that a majority of fig species have one or more host-specific pollinator. The extent to which specificity barriers in these species are leaky will have important consequences for the evolutionary process in Ficus. At Lambir Hills N.P., Sarawak, a single individual of Ficus acamptophylla has become recently isolated from conspecifics through clearance of its specialized habitat, but adjacent forest has a diverse fig flora, including 16 species with congeneric pollinators. Thus, when this individual flowered I was able to investigate the maintenance of its specificity barriers in the absence of competition from the normal pollinator. Only 1 percent of inflorescences were entered by a single pollinator species, which had very low reproductive success, and no viable seeds were produced. Nonpollinating wasps also failed to reproduce in any of the inflorescences. These results indicate the maintenance of strict specificity barriers in this fig individual.

AB Small vertebrates were inventoried within three habitat types in a degraded dry forest region of Panama. Animals were classified as frugivorous if they were observed foraging on fruit or if fecal samples contained mostly or exclusively seeds. Overall, we found that eight bat species and 21 bird species consumed fruit. The greatest numbers of birds were observed within live fences and bird species richness was greatest within riparian forests. Bat assemblages were not significantly different between habitats. The implication is that ecosystem services such as seed dispersal may still be functional in this landscape.

Two other avian species, Trogon rufus and Habia rubica, have also been observed following coatis. This "following foraging behavior" is more frequent during the dry season when coatis forage in trees. For the birds, this can represent a coping strategy with the reduced resource availability during the drier season.

AB Because of tropical forests' disproportionate importance for world biodiversity and for the global carbon cycle, we urgently need to understand any effects on these ecosystems from the ongoing changes in climate and atmosphere. This review, intended to complement existing data reviews on this topic, focuses on three major classes of challenges that we currently face when trying to detect and interpret directional changes in tropical forests. One is the very limited existing information on the historical context of study sites. Lasting effects from past climate, natural disturbances, and/or human activities could be significantly affecting current-day processes in tropical forests and need to be investigated for all active field sites. Second, while progress has been made in recent years on standardizing and refining research approaches, a number of methods- and data-limitations continue to affect efforts both to detect within-forest changes and to relate them to ongoing environmental change. Important outstanding needs are improved sampling designs, longer time-series of observations, filling key data gaps, and data access. Finally, forest responses to ongoing environmental change are complex. The effects of many simultaneously changing environmental factors are integrated by the plants, and their responses can involve significant lags, carryovers, and non-linearities. Specifying effects of individual environmental changes, however, is required for accurate ecosystem-process models and thus for projecting future impacts on these forests. After discussing these several types of challenges and ways to address them, I conclude with a priority agenda for this critical area of research.

AB Tropical forests are often shaped by disturbance events, especially in regions where hurricanes and other severe storms occur. We studied the effects of Hurricane Georges (September 1998) on the sierra palm (Prestoea acuminata var. montana) in the Luquillo Mountains of Puerto Rico. We established riparian transects along two headwater streams that were similar in size and location, but differed in riparian tree species composition and land-use history. Following Hurricane Georges, sierra palms were surveyed periodically for damage and recovery (measured by initial loss and subsequent regrowth of palm leaves), tree height, sun exposure, and production of inflorescences and infructescences. Palm height had the highest association with damage, with most damage occurring to canopy palms. Palm recovery (4 mo and 10 mo post-hurricane) was associated with high tree density, indicating that sun exposure was not limiting. Hurricane Georges likely reduced production of flowers and fruits in sierra palms for at least 10 mo following the storm, although production of new leaves was rapid. Although palms recovered quickly from defoliation after the hurricane, decreased reproduction resulted in reduced availability of fruit for terrestrial and aquatic consumers.

AB The stoichiometry of resources may explain bottom-up regulation of higher trophic levels. We tested the effects of soil and litter nutrient stoichiometry on the invertebrate litter fauna of a Costa Rican tropical rain forest. Animal densities were estimated from 15 sites across a phosphorus gradient. The density of the invertebrate litter fauna varied considerably, and was strongly tied to soil and litter phosphorus concentrations. An increase in phosphorus concentrations corresponded with an equally proportionate increase in animal densities. Natural variation in nutrient levels can thus serve as a predictor of density in a highly diverse tropical animal community.

AB Miconia prasina (Melastomataceae) is an important colonizing species during early stages of secondary succession in Puerto Rico but its abundance declines with increasing stand age. We studied its demography for 2 yr (1995-1997) in three populations across a pasture to forest chronosequence (1-, 12-, and 25-yr old) and in one population in a hurricane-disturbed older forest (> 60-yr old). Vegetative growth was positive in the two young sites, but negative in the two older sites. The highest percentage of plants that flowered occurred in the two younger sites but highest seed production occurred in the 25-yr-old site. Although seed germination occurred in the two older sites, no seedlings established. Vegetative reproduction (root sprouts) was found in all sites, with most sprouts occurring in young sites. The 2 yr of census data were used to construct stage-based transition matrices. In the two young sites, the average population growth rate was positive (lambda > 1), while average population growth was negative in the two older sites (lambda < 1). Elasticity, a measure of the effects of proportional changes in life-history transitions to the long-term population growth rate, varied across both stages and sites. Elasticity shifted from large plants in young sites to small plants in older sites. Across all sites, elasticities related to survival were more important than those of growth or vegetative reproduction. The demographic analysis supported the previous observations of changes in the density of M. prasina based on the chronosequence and also suggests that establishment via seeds must occur prior to abandonment in active pastures.

AB We investigated microclimatic edge gradients associated with grassy powerlines, paved highways and perennial creeks in wet tropical forest in northeastern Australia during wet and dry seasons. Photosynthetically active radiation, air temperature and vapor pressure deficit, soil temperature, canopy temperature, soil moisture, and air speed in the rain forest understory were measured during traverses perpendicular to the forest edge. Light intensity was elevated near the edges of powerlines, highways, and creeks, but this effect was strongest for creek edges. Air temperature and vapor pressure deficit were elevated near powerline edges in the dry season and highway edges in both wet and dry seasons but were not elevated near creek edges in either season. In contrast, soil moisture was lowered near creek edges but not near either powerline or highway edges. No edge gradients were detected for air speed. Canopy temperature was elevated near highway edges and lowered near powerline edges in the wet season but no edge gradients in canopy temperature were detected near creek edges in either the wet or the dry season. We suggest that these different edge gradients may be largely the result of differences in the fluxes of latent and sensible heat within each type of linear canopy opening, with periodic flood disturbance assisting by maintaining a more open canopy near creek edges. Our data indicate that the nature of the linear canopy opening is at least as important as the width in determining the nature and severity of microclimatic edge effects, analogous to the "matrix effect" of traditional fragmentation studies.

AB Quercus humboldtii is a montane forest dominant species in Colombia, which has experienced significant habitat loss. Using three microsatellite loci, we compared the genetic diversity of adults and seedlings in fragments of small and large size. Results show high genetic diversity, comparable to other temperate oak species (H(o) = 0.813, H(e) = 0.780, and f = -0.044). However, allelic richness reduction in seedlings of the most fragmented part of the landscape, suggested restricted gene flow and risk of future genetic bottlenecks, if larger tracts of forest disappear.

AB Dioecy, the segregation of male and female structures among individuals, is widespread in tropical plants, encompassing 10-30 percent of species in some sites. In many cases, interindividual sex separation is not complete, as individual plants, although nominally dioecious, may produce both types of reproductive structures. A common form of this sexual variation is the production of female structures in otherwise male individuals, commonly referred to as fruiting males. Here we report the existence of fruiting males in the dioecious tropical tree Jacaratia mexicana (Caricaceae). We show that fruiting males can constitute up to 45 percent of all males in some populations of a tropical forest in Southern Mexico. In order to determine the functional significance of fruiting males for the breeding system of J. mexicana, we compared the relative performance of male- and female-borne seeds. Our results show that seeds from fruiting males are three times less likely to germinate and survive than seeds from female trees. Based on relative seed fitness data, and sex ratios in natural populations, we estimate that 6-15 percent of the genes contributed by fruiting males to the next generation are transmitted via ovules, meaning that morphological variation in gender is at least partially accompanied by functional gender variation. Finally, our seed fitness estimates for fruiting males suggest that fruiting males will not replace female plants in natural populations.

AB We present evidence that differences in soil seedbank persistence among pioneer plants in the cloud forest of Monteverde, Costa Rica, are influenced by differences in seed chemical defense. We used extracted seed chemicals from Bocconia frutescens (Papaveraceae), Guettarda poasana (Rubiaceae), Phytolacca rivinoides (Phytolaccaceae), Urera elata (Urticaceae), Cecropia polyphlebia (Cecropiaceae), and Witheringia meiantha (Solanaceae) to assess seed chemical defense in two ways: (1) a plant pathogen inhibition assay using Pythium irregulare; and (2) a brine shrimp toxicity assay using Artemia salina. The combined performance of each species in the two assays positively correlated with seedbank persistence. In the pathogen assay, mycelium growth was reduced when Pythium was cultured on media containing seed extracts from the three species with the greatest seed longevity in the soil (i.e., Bocconia, Guettarda, and Phytolacca). Bocconia, the most persistent species, was the only species that contained chemicals toxic to brine shrimp, an indication of defense against arthropods. We focused on Bocconia defense by isolating the chemicals toxic to brine shrimp and identified them as dihydrosanguinarine, dihydrochelirubine, and dihydrochelerthrine. We found these alkaloids in Bocconia seeds at much higher concentrations (similar to 50 mg/g seed material) than in leaves. These chemicals are likely responsible for the exceptional longevity of Bocconia seeds in the soil. Phytolacca and Guettarda seeds also remain viable in the soil for long periods probably due to antipathogen chemicals detected in our analyses. In contrast, the species that do not persist (i.e., Urera, Cecropia, and Witheringia) lacked seed defensive chemicals in our assays.

AB We studied temporal dynamics of diverse moth ensembles (Arctiidae and Geometridae) in early and late succession stages of forest recovery in the montane zone of southern Ecuador. Moths were sampled using weak light sources (2 x 15 W tubes per trap) during three sampling periods (March-April 2002, wet season; October-November 2002, and August-October 2003, both "dry" seasons). Arctiid moth abundance hardly varied between sampling periods. Estimates of local diversity were lower in 2002 (wet and dry season) than in the dry season 2003, and ensemble composition was more strongly affected by sampling period rather than habitat differences. Geometridae ensembles revealed stronger temporal patterns. Geometrid abundance increased about twofold from the wet to the dry season, and temporal effects on species composition were far more pronounced that in arctiids. These differences might hint to variation in the dependence of geometrid versus arctiid larvae on ephemeral plant resources. Despite these significant temporal dynamics, in both families only a few of the more common species analyzed individually showed strong temporal changes in abundance. Almost all common species occurred as adults during all sampling periods. Therefore, even though temporal dynamics of moth ensembles are not negligible, both moth families are suitable "indicators" of community diversity and change along the succession gradient. Samples must be large enough, however, and preferably should be collated over various times of the year and in parallel, to allow for valid statements about moth diversity and species compositions in relation to habitat differences. These recommendations undermine the validity of the concept of "rapid biodiversity inventories" for speciose tropical insect communities.

AB We present data on sample richness, relative abundance, and community structure of a leaf litter amphibian assemblage from globally important miombo-mopane woodlands characteristic of western Tanzania. We describe patterns of diversity across major habitat types and between different seasons from an annual pitfall-trapping campaign. We recorded 28 species of amphibians, which is significantly higher than existing richness estimates for other miombo woodland sites elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa. We found that cultivation of native habitat reduces frog diversity, a conclusion that has important implications in light of the rapid conversion of miombo woodland for agriculture and fuel-wood across much of southern and central Africa. Many species showed strongly ansynchronized patterns of seasonality in relative abundance, which has significant implications for the establishment of successful monitoring programs and biodiversity surveys. These conclusions emphasize the importance of stratified long-term sampling in biodiversity studies and demonstrate that superficial levels of sampling effort can lead to erroneous conclusions regarding patterns of diversity in amphibian communities. The relatively poor focus on herpetofaunal research in African miombo-mopane woodland is out of proportion to its ecological and conservation significance.

AB Rate of oxygen consumption was measured in five bulbuls (Family Pycnonotidae) from western Uganda to evaluate whether this group is indeed characterized by the very low basal rates of metabolism previously reported. For three of these species, body temperature and rate of metabolism were measured as a function of ambient temperature from 10 degrees C to 35 degrees C. In these species body temperature was highly variable, and declined with ambient temperature in Andropadus virens. Such variation, in conjunction with behavioral adjustments, may reduce heat loss at low ambient temperatures. Body mass accounted for 98 percent of the variation in the basal rates of metabolism presented here. Basal rates in these species ranged from 81 to 90 percent of values predicted by the Aschoff-Pohl relationship for passerines, whereas previous measurements ranged from 56 to 72 percent of predicted values. This difference may reflect differences in species or measurement techniques, which, if the latter, suggests that the reduction in metabolic rate in this family may be less than originally thought. These data underline the importance of continued data collection on the metabolism of tropical birds, few of which have been measured to date.

AB Although agriculture dominates much of Central America, little is known about the bat assemblages that occur within agricultural landscapes and how bats use different types of tree cover within these landscapes. Using mist-nets and a mark-recapture protocol, we compared bat diversity and movement across six types of tree cover within an agricultural landscape in central Nicaragua. The tree cover types surveyed included secondary forests, riparian forests, forest fallows, live fences, pastures with high tree cover and pastures with low tree cover. We captured a total of 3084 bats of 39 species, including two new species records for the country (Lonchorhina aurita and Molossops greenhalli). Of these, 2970 bats and 27 species were in the Phyllostomidae family. There were significant differences in mean species density, abundance and evenness of phyllostomid bats across the different types of tree cover, but not in bat diversity. Riparian forests had the highest mean species density and bat abundance per plot. In contrast, mean bat abundance and species density were lowest in pastures with low tree cover. Of the 1947 phyllostomid bats marked, a total of 64 bats of eight species were recaptured. The average linear distance between extra-site recaptures was 2227 m (+/- 228 SE) and the maximum distance was 10.6 km. Bats were recorded moving between almost all types of tree cover, and especially to and from riparian forests. Our study suggests that agricultural landscapes retaining a heterogeneous tree cover may maintain a diverse bat assemblage, and that bats visit and use a variety of tree cover types within the agricultural matrix.

AB Reproduction of Amazon River Dolphins, Inia geoffrensis, is generally reported to be highly seasonal; however, this conclusion is based on studies from only one area of Inia distribution from throughout the Amazon and Orinoco river basins. Our observations of live dolphins from the Orinoco, Amazon, and Mamore river basins (in Venezuela, Peru and Bolivia, respectively) indicate that reproduction in Inia often occurs year-round, with seasonal peaks varying according to geographic location. Inia neonates in Peru and Bolivia were seen in all seasons, and were observed most often in falling water (season was defined by relative water level). Conversely, neonates in Venezuela were seen at the end of low water and in rising water, yet were never observed during falling water. Inia mating behavior in Peru was observed in all seasons, while mating was observed only during falling and low water in Bolivia. Our review of the literature from throughout the range of Inia indicates variation in reproductive seasonality, with year-round reproduction in some areas. Seasonality of peaks in births varied according to study area, and may be more closely associated with local environmental and prey conditions than with taxonomic relatedness, relative seasonal differences in water levels, or broad geographic distribution.

AB Previous tests with essential oils from ripe chiropterochoric fruits suggested they can be used to attract and capture fruit-eating bats inside forest remnants. Here we evaluated the efficiency of these oils to attract frugivorous bats to open areas. We performed field tests with artificial fruits impregnated with essential oils of the genera Piper or Ficus that were attached to two groups of mist-nets set 50 m outside the border of a forest remnant. One group of artificial fruits received the corresponding oil isolated through hydrodistillation and the other received water only. Fruits with oils attracted significantly more fruit-eating bats, especially Artibeus lituratus that regularly crosses open habitats to reach other forest remnants. The highly significant attraction of A. lituratus by the oil of Piper was unexpected, since this bat is a specialist on Ficus fruits. We hypothesize that in habitats with no fruit available it is possible to attract frugivorous bats with the odor of several ripe fruit species. Furthermore, we verified that almost half of the individuals captured defecated seeds, indicating that the oils also attract recently fed bats, even when their preferred food is available nearby. This technique potentially may increase seed rain at specific locations, being particularly promising to restoration projects.

AB Hunting often impacts rain forest mammal communities but little is known about its indirect effects on other taxa. We examined dung beetle assemblages using pitfall and flight-intercept traps at six rain forest sites in Panama that ranged in hunting intensity. Heavily hunted sites showed altered community composition, significantly fewer species (based on rarefaction), and lower abundances of dung beetles than did sites with little hunting. Our results suggest that intensive hunting affects nontarget forest taxa and is potentially altering ecosystem functioning.

AB The common vampire bat, Desmodus rotundus, feeds on mammalian blood and is a major agricultural pest in Latin America. One way to prevent bats from biting livestock is to understand how the bats locate the livestock. We confirmed the role of olfaction in foraging with a modified cafeteria trial. Bats significantly favored blood meals associated with scent (fur, feces) over meals lacking these olfactory cues. These results confirm earlier observations on the role of olfaction during prey location by this species, and have potential to facilitate eradication measures without extensive loss of other bat species.

AB There are few hypotheses to explain local understory diversity patterns. There is a consensus that climate and soil fertility affect understory density and diversity at large scales, but few studies addressed the mechanisms controlling density and diversity locally. Here, I examine patterns of abundance and diversity of three understory herb groups along gradients of soil nutrients and topography at the mesoscale (64 km(2)) in a wet tropical forest, and possible factors causing them. Herb richness, diversity, density, and cover were measured in fifty-nine 250 x 2 m plots systematically distributed over Reserva Ducke, Manaus. Herb groups responded differently to environmental gradients. Whereas density and cover of pteridophytes increased with altitude and slope, Marantaceae density and cover decreased. Density of sedges increased with altitude, but did not vary with slope. Density and cover of Marantaceae and sedges but not pteridophytes increased with the soil cation content. Pteridophyte richness increased with slope whereas Marantaceae richness decreased, richness of both groups increased with cation content. Diversity increased with altitude for Marantaceae and decreased for pteridophytes. Some of these patterns agree with what is expected from herbs, such as the greater abundance of Marantaceae and sedges in flat and low altitude plots, where water availability is higher and probably also light, and the greater richness of Marantaceae and pteridophytes in higher nutrient plots. The unexpected results of higher abundance and richness of pteridophytes in slopes, instead of in bottomlands, suggest that biotic or litter-mediated controls may be important to set these patterns.

AB The high degree of isolation of forest "islands" relative to "continental" forested areas creates a naturally fragmented landscape in the savanna ecosystem. Because fragmentation can affect the intensity and quality of biological interactions (e.g., seed dispersal) we examined the abundance and species richness of seed rain produced by birds and bats in three different parts of forest islands (center, edge, and exterior) located at the Estacion Biologica del Beni, Bolivia. Despite the fact that we found higher species density of seeds in the seed rain at the center of forest islands, when comparing species richness corrected for observed differences in density, species richness was higher at the edge of islands. The three parts of the islands did not differ in total number of seeds. Three genera (Byrsonima, Ficus, and Piper) contributed the most seeds to the seed rain. We found differences in the abundance of dispersed seeds probably because of the variation related with the disturbance line, where the savanna matrix interacts with the forest islands. Carollia perspicillata, Carollia brevicauda, and Sturnira lilium were the bats that contributed most to seed dispersal within forest islands, and Schistochlamys melanopis and Tyranneutes stolzmanni were the most important birds. The movement of seeds produced by bats and birds within forest islands of the savanna is crucial to assure the continuity of ecological process and dynamics of these forest islands.

AB Although the use of modified roosts has been reported in more than 20 species of bats in the tropics, comparative studies of the roosting ecology of congeneric tent-roosting species are notably lacking. In the Paleotropics, this unique behavior has been described in two species belonging to the genus, Cynopterus: C. sphinx and C. brachyotis. However, it is not known whether tent roosting is an essential component of their roosting ecology, or whether the behavior is found in other members of the genus. In this study we characterize the roosting ecology of four sympatric species of Cynopterus in peninsular Malaysia and use these data to address two main questions. (1) Do all four species use modified roosts and, in those that do, is tent-roosting obligate or opportunistic ? (2) Do species pairs overlap in roost preferences and roosting habitat and, if so, is there evidence for interspecific interactions in relation to these resources ? We radio-tracked bats at two floristically distinct sites and located a total of 249 roosts. Interspecific roost niche overlap was minimal at both sites and we found no evidence for interspecific competition for roost resources at the local level. Species differences in roosting ecology were defined primarily by spatial separation of roosting habitats and secondarily by within-habitat differences in roost selection. Importantly, we found that although periodic use of modified roosts was a characteristic shared by all four species, most roosts were unmodified, indicating that tent roosting is a facultative behavior in Malaysian Cynopterus.

AB Fundamental to our understanding of the ecology of animal communities in the tropics is knowledge of the effect of seasonal changes in the abundance of food sources in consumer diets. We determined stable-isotope composition (C-13/C-12 and N-15/N-14) in whole blood of 14 resident avian species in a tropical dry forest to quantify the origin of their assimilated protein. We used a probabilistic approach (IsoSource) to estimate the relative contribution of C-3 plants, CAM-C-4 plants, C-3 insects, and CAM-C-4 insects during the dry and rainy seasons. IsoSource iteratively creates each possible combination of source contribution and produces a distribution of all feasible combinations that adequately predict the observed isotopic signature of the consumer. Granivore-frugivores and granivore-frugivore-insectivores were modeled as predominantly dependent upon plants whereas insectivorous birds were modeled to derive protein almost exclusively from insects. Between these extremes there were several species using mixed diets such as insectivore-frugivores or insectivore-granivores. In most species, virtually all assimilated food was of C-3 origin with the exception of Ruddy Ground-Doves (Columbina talpacoti) in which CAM or C-4 plants contributed significantly. Seasonal changes in relative food source contribution were followed in eight species of birds. Of these species, White-tipped Doves (Leptotila verreauxi), Grayish Saltators (Saltator coerulescens), and Social Flycatchers (Myiozetetes similis) increased their use of insects in the rainy season, in contrast to Great Kiskadees (Pitangus sulphuratus), which decreased their use of insects. Our study suggests that that diverse strategies are used by various avian species to obtain dietary proteins within seasonal habitats.

AB Permanent cooperative sociality is rare in spiders. Here we describe sociality in a cobweb (Theridiidae) genus with no other known social species. In five areas of eastern Ecuador, we found nests of Theridion nigroannulatum containing from a single to several thousand adults living together in a communal web. Spiders cooperated in prey capture and shared their food. Subadult to young adult sex ratios were highly female biased, suggesting a strongly subdivided population structure as in other permanent-social spiders. Unusual aspects of T. nigroannulatum's biology include the existence of adult females of two discrete sizes, an extreme boom and bust pattern of colony growth, and the presence, within larger colonies, of populations of a predatory spider (Faiditus spp., Argyrodinae) that may play the role of a colony-level parasite. The existence of females of two sizes may be the result of alternative female reproductive strategies, intracolony competition for resources, or an incipient caste system in this species. A redescription and phylogenetic analysis corroborate the placement of this species in Theridion, indicating that sociality has evolved independently in at least three theridiid genera.

AB In recent years the coastal dune vegetation of the state of Yucatan, Mexico has become highly fragmented due to clearing for development. We evaluated patterns of genetic differentiation and genetic variability among orchid populations (Myrmecophila christinae var christinae) in eight habitat fragments along a west-to-east disturbance gradient in which sites located on the western end began experiencing fragmentation earlier than those in the east. Leaf samples from adult individuals and juvenile plants were collected from all eight populations, and analyzed using starch-gel electrophoresis in a lithium buffer system. Per population estimates of genetic diversity, proportion of polymorphic loci at 95 percent, mean number of alleles per locus, allelic richness, and population structure were calculated, as well as estimate comparisons between generations. Genetic diversity at the loci analyzed did not show significant differences among the eight populations. Based on the results, the model of isolation by distance does not fit the M. christinae populations under study; in some cases, populations close to one another apparently experienced very little genetic exchange. Thus, we propose that so far, fragmentation has not led to significant genetic differences between populations subject to different historical backgrounds of disturbance (i.e., time since onset of disturbance), as well as between generations within each of the M. christinae study populations. Nevertheless, the genetic characteristics of some remnant populations might change over time due to a future decrease in the opportunities for genetic exchange with other populations.

AB Estimates of annual survival are essential for addressing topics in evolutionary and conservation ecology. However, most demographic studies of land birds are based on north temperate species, and few robust estimates of survival based on mark-recapture statistics are available for continental South American birds. We used time-since-marking models to estimate apparent survival of adult birds from 7 yr of mist netting data in the Colonche Hills. This site is one of few remaining large tracts of premontane forest in southwestern Ecuador, and an area of high priority for avian conservation. Species with sufficient data for analysis included three hummingbirds (Adelomyia melanogenys, Heliodoxa jacula, Phaethornis baroni), a cotinga (Schiffornis turdinus), and a wren (Henicorhina leucophrys). Our parameter estimates had reduced precision because the number of recaptures was small. Probability of recapture was low in three species ((p) over cap < 0.23), and moderate in two others ((p) over cap = 0.49-0.62). Adelomyia and Phaethornis had moderate apparent survival ((phi) over cap (2+) = 0.36-0.48; probability that a bird neither died nor emigrated from our survey area in a given year). Adults of Adelomyia moved seasonally, and it is possible that permanent emigration from our survey area contributed to low estimates of apparent survival. The other three species had relatively high estimates of adult apparent survival ranging from. (phi) over cap (2+) = 0.62-0.70 in Heliodoxa and Schiffornis to a high of (p) over cap (2+) = 0.92 in Henicorhina.

AB Seedling density and the condition of stony endocarps of the tree Dipteryx panamensis were assessed in protected continuous forest and two forest fragments exposed to hunting and selective logging. Seedling density was higher in forest fragments than in continuous forest, while more whole endocarps and fewer chewed and half endocarps were found in fragments, indicating lower seed predation at fragment sites. These findings appear to contradict two earlier D. panamensis studies and we discuss methodological differences that could account for our disparate results. Hunting and fragmentation effects on mammal populations are suggested as a cause for the altered recruitment pattern in fragments.

AB After the Asian tsunami the media was inundated with reports of aberrant behavior among animals attributed to a "sixth sense" that allowed them to respond to the catastrophe ahead of the impact. We present behavior data from two satellite-collared Asian elephants that ranged close to the tsunami impact area in Sri Lanka. These data indicate that neither elephant behaved in a manner consistent with a "sixth sense" that allowed an early detection of the approaching tsunami.

AB Low postdispersal mortality of palm seeds in tapir dung is hypothesized to result from the mechanical barrier provided by dung against bruchid infestation and/or from the distance to adult palms at which seeds are dispersed. We tested these hypotheses by distributing endocarps of Attalea phalerata Mart. ex Spreng. in experimental dung piles in Beni, Bolivia. Predation rates were significantly lower for seeds covered by dung than for exposed or partially covered seeds, but did not differ between seeds placed below and 50 m away from palms. Thus, dung, not short-distance dispersal, protects seeds against bruchid beetles, and may ultimately promote survival of palm seeds.

AB Oecophylla ants utilize living leaves when they construct their nests. We investigated how Oecophylla smaragdina nests in southern Thailand affected leaf performance on the mangrove tree Rhizophora mucronata. Leaves used in nests and neighboring leaves showed a higher rate of premature leaf loss compared to control leaves farther from the nests. However, a tree's total cost due to the higher premature leaf loss was estimated to be approximately between 3- and 20-fold lower than the benefit derived from ant protection, detected in a previous study (Offenberg et al. 2004).

AB We compared the effects of ant presence at extrafloral nectaries of Lafoensia pacari St. Hil. on herbivore damage and silicon accumulation. Plants that were accessible to ants experienced lower herbivory levels over the first 3 mo of the experiment. After 3 mo, most leaves were fully expanded with inactive extrafloral nectaries; by 6 mo there was no effect of ant access on herbivore damage. Along with experiencing higher herbivory, plants in the ant-exclusion treatment had significantly higher silicon levels in their leaves, suggesting that silicon serves as an induced defense in this ant-plant-herbivore interaction.

AB Lianas contribute to many aspects of tropical forest diversity and dynamics, and interest in liana ecology has grown substantially in recent years. Methods to census lianas and estimate biomass, however, differ among studies, possibly hindering attempts to compare liana communities. At Nouragues Research Station (French Guiana), we tested the extent to which liana abundance, basal area, and estimated biomass differed depending on stem diameter measurement location, inclusion of ramets, inclusion of lianas rooted within versus passing through the plot, and plot shape. We found that the mean per plot abundance and basal area of lianas were significantly greater when lianas were measured low on the stem, when ramets were included, and when lianas were sampled in transects (2 x 50 m) than in square plots (10 x 10 m). Mean per plot liana abundance and basal area were 21 percent and 58 percent greater, when stems were measured at the largest spot on the stem compared to 130 cm from the ground, respectively. Including liana ramets increased average per plot liana abundance, basal area, and estimated biomass by 19, 17, and 16 percent, respectively. To facilitate cross-study comparisons, we developed conversion equations that equate liana abundance, diameter, and basal area based on the measurements taken at four different stem locations. We tested these equations at Lambir Hills National Park, Malaysia and found that they did not differ significantly between the two sites, suggesting that the equations may be broadly applicable. Finally, we present a new allometric equation relating diameter and biomass developed from 424 lianas from five independent data sets collected in four countries.

AB Fire is a frequent disturbance in the tropical dry forests of Central America, yet very little is known about how native species respond to such events. We conducted an experimental burn in a tropical dry forest of western Nicaragua to evaluate plant responses to fire with respect to survivorship and recruitment. Measurements of woody vegetation of all size classes were carried out prior to the prescribed burn and three successive years post fire. We selected the 15 most abundant species < 10 cm DBH to assess percent survivorship and sprouting responses post fire. Changes in seedling densities for these 15 most abundant species and the 15 least abundant species were analyzed using a repeated measure ANOVA. We also assessed changes in seedling densities for three species of international conservation concern. We found three major fire-coping strategies among common dry forests plants: resisters (low fire-induced mortality), resprouters (vigorous sprouting), and recruiters (increased seeding post-fire). While survivorship was generally high relative to tropical moist forest species, those species with lower survivorship used either seeding or sprouting as an alternative strategy for persisting in the forest community. Seed dispersal mechanisms, particularly wind dispersal, appear to be an important factor in recruitment success post-fire. Burn treatment led to a significant increase in the density of seedlings for two species of conservation concern: Guaiacum sanctum and Swietenia humilis. Results of this study suggest that common dry forest species in western Nicaragua are fire tolerant. Further study of individual species and their fire responses is merited.

AB The role of Euclea divinorum in the establishment of broad-leaved thickets was investigated in Serengeti National Park, Tanzania. Thickets are declining due to frequent fires, but have not reestablished when fires have been removed. Seedlings of E. divinorum, a fire-resistant tree, were found in grassland adjacent to thickets and as thicket canopy trees and may function to facilitate thicket establishment. Seedlings of thicket species were abundant under E. divinorum canopy trees but not in the grassland, indicating that E. divinorum can facilitate forest establishment. We examined E. divinorum establishment in grassland by measuring survival and growth of seedlings with respect to fire, browsers, elephants, and competition with grass. Seedling survival was reduced by fire (50%), browsers (70%), and competition with grass (50%), but not by elephants. Seedling growth rate was negative unless both fire and browsers, or grass was removed. Establishment of thickets via E. divinorum is not occurring under the current conditions in Serengeti of frequent fires, abundant browsers, and dense grass in riparian areas. Conditions that allowed establishment may have occurred in 1890-1920s during a rinderpest epizootic, and measurements of thicket canopy trees suggest they established at that time.

AB We hypothesized that salinity and light interactively affect mangroves, such that net photosynthesis, growth, and survivorship rates increase more with increase in light availability at low than high salinity. Using greenhouse and field experiments, we determined that net photosynthesis, growth rates, and size increased more with light at low than high salinity. At high salinity, the ratio of leaf respiration to assimilation increased fourfold, suggesting that salinity may have contributed to declines in net photosynthesis. Stomatal conductance, leaf-level transpiration, and internal CO2 concentrations were lower at high salinity. Ratios of root mass to leaf mass were higher at high salinity. Stomatal limitations and increased respiratory costs may explain why at high salinity, the seedlings did not respond to increased light availability with increased net photosynthesis. Increased root mass relative to leaf mass suggests that at high salinity, either water or nutrient limitations may have prevented the seedlings from increasing growth with increasing light availability. At both low- and high-salinity zones in the field, seedling survivorship increased with light availability, and the effect of light was stronger at low salinity. However, at low light, survivorship was higher at high than low salinity, indicating that there may be a trade-off between survivorship and growth. The interactive effects observed in the greenhouse were robust in the field, despite the presence of other factors in the field such as inundation and nutrient gradients and herbivory. This study provides a robust test of the hypothesis that salinity and light interactively effect mangrove seedling performance.

AB We documented bark consumption by painted ringtails (Pseudochirulus forbesi) and other arboreal marsupials at Mt. Stolle, Papua New Guinea. Evidence consisted of scratch marks on the boles of trees in conjunction with the removal of all moss and direct sightings of animals eating bark. Only 43 trees >= 10 cm diameter at breast height (DBH) of 19 species showed signs of consumption at the study site; five of these species were confirmed by direct sighting to be consumed by painted ringtails. We sought to determine if bark of these trees contained important dietary minerals. Analyses showed that calcium and potassium, individually and combined, were significantly more abundant in eaten versus uneaten trees of the same species. On average, eaten trees showed 4.7 and 2.2 times the amount of these minerals, respectively, as found in uneaten trees. Adult males were more likely than adult females or juvenile males to be captured at eaten trees than away from them. Two species of Syzygium and one species of Sloanea were highly selected for bark consumption, but not all trees of a species were eaten; rather, particular individuals of these species were preferred. We conclude that bark appears to be an important source of calcium and potassium, and speculate on the relationship between the limited availability of these special trees and the social behavior of painted ringtails.

AB Food resources are arguably the most common limiting factor for most species, yet little is known about how food quantity and quality interact to determine the size and distribution of wildlife populations. Frugivores may be limited by food quality since fruits, unlike leaves, are typically low in protein and minerals. Understanding the factors influencing frugivore population dynamics is particularly important due to rapid habitat loss and the need to construct informed management plans. Therefore, this study used redtail monkeys in Kibale National Park, Uganda as a model frugivore to (1) compare nutrient intake, reproduction, and habitat use patterns for three redtail groups in an unlogged and heavily logged area; and (2) examine relationships between nutrient intake and redtail population densities across five habitats. Feeding time and intake of crude protein, lipids, and minerals were higher in diets consumed by groups in unlogged areas than heavily logged areas. Intake of both copper and sodium intake was below NRC requirement levels suggested for macaques. Food availability in the unlogged areas was 3.5 times higher than the heavily logged area. Across five study sites, absorbable copper and the ratio of copper to caloric intake in redtail diets were significantly related to redtail population density. These results suggest that food quality is an important factor determining frugivore population density in anthropogenically disturbed frugivore habitats. Copper deficiency, which has been associated with population declines of wild herbivores, has the potential to be a key factor limiting densities of frugivores in tropical habitats.

AB Generalized pollination systems may be advantageous on island systems or regions of substantial disturbance. We examined whether or not specialization breakdown has occurred in a presumably bat-pollinated columnar cactus, Pilosocereus royenii, on Puerto Rico, an island subjected to periodic hurricanes. The flowers show characteristics related to bat pollination including nocturnal anthesis, morphology, and amount and quality of nectar reward. The cactus produces flowers whose styles are temporally and mechanically separated from its anthers and do not self-pollinate. Hand manipulations indicated that it is partially self-incompatible or suffers some inbreeding depression. In 217 h of observations conducted biweekly over the course of 1 yr, P. royenii received visits from bats, moths, bees, and birds, but the only effective pollinator was the carpenter bee, Xylocopa mordax. Only four bat visits were recorded, all prior to stigma receptiveness. Floral morphology of P. royenii was significantly more variable than that of other bat-pollinated species of the genus. We propose that infrequent bat visits are a consequence of a population crash and that floral variability is due to either relaxed selection for bat pollination or a transitional stage from bat pollination to bee pollination.

AB This study applies a novel, vertically stratified fogging protocol to document arthropod abundance, density, and biomass across a vertical gradient in a primary, lowland dipterocarp forest canopy in Borneo. We fogged arthropods at 5 m vertical intervals and 20 m horizontal intervals along six full-canopy transects and measured leaf surface areas along the same transects. The results show that arthropod biomass in the aboveground regions was 23.6 kg/ha, the abundance was 23.9 million individuals/ha, and the density on leaf surfaces was 280 individuals/m(2) leaf area. All three numbers are five to ten times higher than estimated by previous surveys of tropical lowland rain forest canopies using mass-collection techniques. Arthropod abundance and biomass were analyzed in relation to canopy structure, composition, vapor pressure deficit (VPD), photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD), and height. Using stepwise regression we found that 13 of 14 arthropod groups had significant positive relationships with one-sided leaf area, 11 had significant negative relationships with VPD, 3 had significant relationships with height, and none showed positive relationships with light. Classifying the 14 taxa based on their responses to leaf area and VPD created three groups that corresponded roughly to the biology of these taxa. This study suggests that the biomass and abundance, and perhaps therefore-by extrapolation-the biodiversity, of tropical canopy arthropods may be very much higher than previously estimated.

AB Camponotus mirabilis (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) is a highly specialized resident of live Guadua bamboo in western Amazonia. Workers in established colonies open and invade young, unlignified culms, and mature polydomous colonies occupy several-to-many adjacent stems. Multistoried carton shelves support brood inside culms, and larvae are nourished by honeydew of coccids (Cryptostigma guadua). Constructing a system of stem holes and wicks, C. mirabilis modifies occupied stems in ways that produce passive water evacuation. Nocturnally foraging workers gather both prey and wood fiber, a component of wicks. Diurnally, they boil aggressively from agitated stems, and are attacked by parasitic phorid flies (Diptera: Phoridae). Culms housing C. mirabilis are stouter and more erect than are unoccupied stems but are opened regularly by capuchin monkeys (Cebus apella) searching for brood and perhaps reproductive castes. Damaged by monkeys, weak-walled Guadua stems frequently collapse and are abandoned by ants. Breakdown of brood shelves leaves nutrient-rich carton suspended in water within basal internodes, but isotopic analyses fail to show that occupied culms utilize either nitrogen from carton or carbon respired by ants or decomposing debris. Lower foliar nitrogen concentration in occupied than in control stems suggests that coccids and ants parasitize host resources. A prior experimental survey of bamboo ants may have missed C. mirabilis because females found new colonies in culms occupied by another bamboo specialist, and established colonies invade only young bamboo growth.

AB Roads can facilitate the establishment and spread of both native and exotic species. Nevertheless, the precise mechanisms facilitating this expansion are rarely known. We tested the hypothesis that dirt roads are favorable landing and nest initiation sites for founding-queens of the leaf-cutter ant Atta laevigata. For 2 yr, we compared the number of attempts to found new nests (colonization attempts) in dirt roads and the adjacent vegetation in a reserve of cerrado (tree-dominated savanna) in southeastern Brazil. The number of colonization attempts in roads was 5 to 10 times greater than in the adjacent vegetation. Experimental transplants indicate that founding-queens are more likely to establish a nest on bare soil than on soil covered with leaf-litter, but the amount of litter covering the ground did not fully explain the preference of queens for dirt roads. Queens that landed on roads were at higher risk of predation by beetles and ants than those that landed in the adjacent vegetation. Nevertheless, greater predation in roads was not sufficient to offset the greater number of colonization attempts in this habitat. As a consequence, significantly more new colonies were established in roads than in the adjacent vegetation. Our results suggest that disturbance caused by the opening of roads could result in an increased Atta abundance in protected areas of the Brazilian Cerrado.

Cette etude evalue les consequences des populations exotiques de W. auropunctata en Afrique continentale. En echantillonnant la myrmecofaune dans neuf sites au Parc National de la Lope au Gabon, j'ai trouve une forte correlation entre la diversite de fourmis et la duree ecoulee depuis l'arrivee de W. auropunctata. Les especes de fourmi indigenes sont beaucoup plus nombreuses dans les zones encore vierges (39.0 +/- 4.6) en comparant avec les sites envahis depuis environ 5 et 10 ans (7.0 +/- 6.2 et 1.7 +/- 1.2, respectivement). Dans les sites envahis, W. auropunctata representait la majorite des specimens rencontres dans chaque echantillonnage. Cette etude met en evidence la menace posee par W. auropunctata aux ecosystemes continentaux, tout comme l'ont montrees les etudes anterieures pour des ecosystemes insulaires plus fragiles. L'implantation pres des cours d'eau est fulgurante: a la Lope, l'essentiel du territoire envahi est situe le long des cours d'eau, suggerant un transport facilite par l'eau.

AB Mucuna (Fabaceae) has explosive flowers that open only if a pressure is applied on their wings and keel. The cacique Cacicus haemorrhous inserts its bill into a flower and spreading its mandibles apart it opens the flower to take nectar. This icterine bird also preys upon caterpillars of the butterfly Astraptes talus that pupates within the flowers. Foraging with use of bill movements to take nectar or insects within a flower is an adequate mechanism to open and pollinate explosive flowers. We suggest that a plausible behavioral scenario for the pollination relationship between icterines and Mucuna-like flowers might start with the birds' searching for insects within flowers.

AB Ruminant-mediated seed dispersal, an understudied process in tropical forests, was examined via Phyllanthus emblica-Axis axis interaction. A captive Axis deer regurgitated intact P. emblica seeds after retaining them in the rumen for 7-27 h. At Rajaji National Park, a considerable fraction (22%) of deer-regurgitated P. emblica seeds germinated, although lower than unconsumed seeds (72%). The size and strength of seeds like P. emblica might ensure that ruminants regurgitate them intact instead of defecating them.

AB The role of red-footed tortoises (Geochelone carbonaria) and yellow-footed tortoises (G. denticulata) as seed dispersal agents was investigated in northwestern Brazil from 5 to 26 January 2002 by analyzing fecal samples for frequency and viability of seed species and estimating daily displacement of tortoises from recaptured and thread-trailed individuals. Fourteen of 19 fecal samples contained a total of 646 seeds represented by 11 plant species. The most abundant species was Ficus sp. (N = 400) with 100 percent of seeds viable, followed by Aechmea sp. (N = 88) with 93 percent of seeds viable, and Genipa americana (N = 59) with 91 percent of seeds viable. Mean minimum retention time of seeds was 1.6 d and mean daily displacement of tortoises based on recaptured (N = 7) and thread-trailed tortoises (N = 2) was 57 m. Thus, the diversity and proportion of viable seeds consumed by tortoises, combined with the seed retention times and daily movements, suggest they may be effective dispersal agents. These preliminary findings warrant further investigation into the ecological role of these tortoises in Neotropical ecosystems and their contribution to the maintenance of species diversity and forest structure.

In 2002, we reexamined jaguar diet following two decades of mitigated human hunting of jaguar prey. We observed high overlap between historical and current jaguar diet constructs. Nine-banded armadillo remained the most frequently consumed prey item. However, collared peccary consumption increased by nearly 20 percent while dietary breadth decreased by 60 percent presumably reflecting increased prey availability following reduced human hunting pressure.

Agoutis were captured from behind and killed with a bite through the back of the skull. The kill sites for two female agoutis were significantly closer to their den sites than expected, while kill sites for two males were not. All carcasses were completely covered by leaves during the day and were fed on during night hours. Predation by ocelots can be a significant cause of mortality for agoutis at Barro Colorado Island (BCI).

AB The influence of El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on rainfall and its possible effect on availability of food for white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in a tropical dry forest in the Pacific coast of Mexico was studied. From 1977 to 2003 there were three significant El Nino and La Nina events. During El Nino years rainfall decreased during the wet season ( June to October) and increased during the dry season (November to May), with the opposite effect during La Nina years. Plant diversity was monitored in permanent plots during the wet and dry seasons of 1989-1993. The results provide evidence that ENSO events affect deer food availability, particularly in the dry season.

AB IT IS WIDELY ANTICIPATED THAT HABITAT LOSS will cause a mass extinction of tropical forest species. To evaluate this possibility, Wright & Muller-Landau (2006, henceforth WML) project future net tropical forest loss from United Nations projections of human population growth and present day relationships between human population density and the percentage of original forest cover remaining for 45 countries that support 89.6 percent of extant, humid tropical forest. Absolute rates of deforestation (area/yr) are predicted to decline in this analysis, and urbanization is predicted to accelerate the decline to the extent that rural populations control forest cover change. These projections suggest that large areas of tropical forest cover will remain in 2030 and beyond, and thus that habitat loss will threaten extinction for a smaller proportion of tropical forest species than previously predicted. Brook et al. (2006, henceforth BBKS) object. BBKS repeat caveats presented by WML and raise additional objections. Here, we show why we believe most of these new objections are unfounded.

AB Landsliding is a natural process influencing montane ecosystems, particularly in areas with elevated rainfall and seismic activity. Yet, to date, little effort has been made to quantify the contribution of this process to land-cover change. Focusing on the mountains of Mexico and Central America (M-CA), we estimated the contribution of landsliding to land-cover change at two scales. At the scale of M-CA, we classified the terrain into major landforms and entered in a GIS historical data on earthquake- and rainfall-triggered landslides. At the scale of the Sierra de Las Minas of Guatemala, we investigated Landsat TM data to map rainfall-triggered landslides. During the past 110 yr, > 136,200 ha of land in the mountains of M-CA have been affected by landslides, which translates into disturbance rates exceeding 0.317 percent/century. In Sierra de Las Minas, rainfall associated with hurricane Mitch affected 1765 ha of forest, or equivalently, landslides triggered by storms of this magnitude transformed between 0.196 (return time of 500 yr) and 1.290 (return time of 75 yr) percent of forest/century. Although landsliding results in smaller rates of land-cover change than deforestation, we hypothesize that it has a stronger impact on ecosystems, both in qualitative and quantitative terms, given its influence on vegetation and soil. Moreover, interactions between landsliding and deforestation may be altering the expression of this complex process such that the few protected areas in the mountains of M-CA may represent the only possibility for the conservation of this process.

AB Grasslands created by grass invasions into shrublands or woodlands followed by fire are now a dominant feature of many seasonally dry environments. In Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, introduced perennial grasses dominate grasslands created by fire in grass-invaded woodlands. In a previous study, we found that net primary production in these grasslands is substantially lower than in unburned woodlands. Yet, our estimates of annual net nitrogen (N) mineralization showed higher rates in these savannas than in the unburned woodlands, rates that appear to greatly exceed annual N demand by the vegetation. We therefore hypothesized that N should not be limited to the plants growing in these sites. We tested this hypothesis with a 2-yr fertilization experiment. At peak biomass, we found a 30 percent increase in live biomass in plots with N added and no increase in production with only phosphorus (P) added. N and P together were synergistic, suggesting that co-limitation or P limitation becomes important when N is more available. Plants responded to added N by increasing individual leaf area and shoot length by over 50 percent. Tissue N was higher with added N; hence, biomass N was substantially higher. Tissue P concentrations declined with N addition but were elevated by P addition despite lack of a growth response to P alone. Overall, N limitation exists despite high annual rates of net N mineralization, and co-limitation of production by P may occur when N is abundant. Here, asynchrony between plant nutrient demand and N availability may contribute to N limitation.

AB Several studies in lowland tropical rain forests have documented effects of local-scale topographic variation on plant species distribution and abundance patterns. Few studies have compared the distribution patterns of more than one plant group, however, and even fewer have related these to measured physical and chemical soil characteristics. Here, we document such soil characteristics within a square 1-ha plot in Amazonian Ecuador, and compare them to the distribution patterns of terrestrial pteridophytes, angiosperm ground herbs, and palms. Substantial variation in soil properties was found within the plot. The three plant groups showed highly correlated floristic patterns within the 1-ha plot even after the effect of geographical distances had been taken into account. Mantel tests yielded significant correlations between edaphic patterns, as measured by distances in various soil and topographic characteristics, and floristic patterns. For all three plant groups, differences in elevation within the plot were highly correlated with floristic distances, and for terrestrial pteridophytes and palms, distances in soil calcium content and sand content were also important. Our results resembled those obtained at wider spatial scales with the same plant groups, which indicates that soil factors may play an important role for distribution and beta diversity of plants, even at the local scale.

AB Species diversity-environmental heterogeneity (D-EH) and species diversity-productivity (D-P) relationships have seldom been analyzed simultaneously even though such analyses could help to understand the processes underlying contrasts in species diversity among sites. Here we analyzed both relationships at a local scale for a highly diverse tropical dry forest of Mexico. We posed the following questions: (1) are environmental heterogeneity and productivity related ?; (2) what are the shapes of D-EH and D-P relationships ?; (3) what are individual, and interactive, contributions of these two variables to the observed variance in species diversity ?; and (4) are patterns affected by sample size, or by partitioning into average local diversity and spatial species turnover ? All trees (diameter at breast height >= 5 cm) within twenty-six 0.2-ha transects were censused; four environmental variables associated with water availability were combined into an environmental heterogeneity index; aboveground standing biomass was used as a productivity estimator. Simple and multiple linear and nonlinear regression models were run. Environmental heterogeneity and productivity were not correlated. We found consistently positive log-linear D-EH and D-P relationships. Productivity explained a larger fraction of among-transect variance in species diversity than did environmental heterogeneity. No effects of sample size were found. Different components of diversity varied in sensitivity to environmental heterogeneity and productivity. Our results suggest that species' differentiation along water availability gradients and species exclusion at the lowest productivity (driest) sites occur simultaneously, independently, and in a scale-dependent fashion on the tree community of this forest.

AB Human activities such as logging and agriculture can severely damage forest ecosystems by changing forest structure, ecosystem function, and biodiversity. These changes may have long-lasting consequences, which influence forest recovery. We investigated the effect of past human disturbance on the current distribution of an understory, achlorophyllous orchid, Wullschlaegelia calcarata in Puerto Rico's tropical rain forest after 70 yr of recovery. Our study site was the 16-ha Luquillo Forest Dynamics Plot located in the Luquillo Experimental Forest, which has four areas with differing intensity of land use that have been distinguished from variation in canopy cover seen in aerial photographs taken in 1936. We recorded orchids in six 10-m-wide, 500-m-long transects across four different areas of land-use history. We found that the orchid was not present in an area of the plot which had < 20 percent canopy cover in 1936, and was most abundant in the area with > 80 percent canopy cover, which had been minimally impacted by human activity. Tree species composition varied among land-use history areas, and our observations suggested that this variation might be influencing the local distribution of W. calcarata. We also measured leaf litter biomass and identified the leaves of litter in areas with and without the orchid. Litter with a high proportion of Buchenavia tetraphylla leaves had more orchids. Even though human disturbance ceased in 1932, land-use history in the Luquillo Forest still casts a shadow over the distribution of W. calcarata.

AB Cicindela (Calochroa) whithilli (Hope) and Cicindela (Calochroa) flavomaculata Hope (Cicindelidae: Coleoptera) are seasonally dominant predatory insects in the cultivated, and irrigated rice paddy fields of the South Indian peninsula. While studying the feeding ecology of these tiger beetles in rice paddy agro-ecosystems in Sringeri area of the central Western Ghats, we examined their potential as biocontrols on the major rice paddy pest populations available in this region. Earthworms and tadpoles were significant prey organisms during the early cultivation period, while other traditional prey organisms like ants and spiders (mainly wolf and jumping spiders) were more common as prey organisms toward the mid-season. The results showed that the feeding fauna of tiger beetles can extend to prey items beyond arthropods, to include vertebrates. Cicindela (Calochroa) duponti Dejean is another common species that occurs abundantly in the Areca orchards and on the bunds that separate rice paddy fields from adjacent uncultivated lands. We performed laboratory tests to determine the feeding guild of these beetles, and to investigate their possible role as a predator of the rice paddy pests. Although preliminary in nature, the results suggest that both C. whithilli and C. flavomaculata are ineffective as biocontrol agents of rice paddy agro-ecosystems. They appear to have only a marginal impact on the larvae of Leptocorisa acuta, a major insect pest of paddy rice, but further experimental and observational studies are needed to firmly establish the significance of this observation.

AB Monodominant forests are a widespread feature of the humid and wet lowland tropics, but little is known about their origins or factors mediating their persistence. Nonetheless, escape from significant vertebrate and invertebrate seed predation plays a prominent role in most hypotheses. The seeds of Pentaclethra macroloba (Fabaceae: Mimosoideae) have long been thought to be virtually immune to predation, contributing to its local dominance in the canopy of some Mesoamerican forests. Here, we describe herbivory by the larvae of Carmenta surinamensis (Lepidoptera: Sesiidae) on the seeds of P. macroloba, and report the results of studies designed to clarify how this interaction influences germination, seedling growth, and mortality. To this end, we collected P. macroloba seeds at 30-d intervals for 5 mo along a rain forest transect in Costa Rica. The seeds were monitored in a shade house for 30 d. Adult moths were reared from 43.6 percent of seeds, and significantly affected germination and mortality, and all measures of growth (number of leaves, seedling height, seed and seedling mass at 30 d, and 30-d change in seed and seedling mass). Based on these observations, we conclude that seed boring by C. surinamensis is a potentially important factor influencing population dynamics in P. macroloba, and warrants further investigation for its prospective role in regulating local abundance in this locally dominant and ecologically significant tree.

AB Herbivores can be associated with distinct ontogenetic stages of their host in a nonseasonal, directional, and continuous pattern of colonization and extinction of species populations called ontogenetic succession, but the processes behind this pattern are still largely unknown. We used plants of Cryptocarya aschersoniana Mez (Lauraceae) belonging to different ontogenetic stages, to examine how the density of different gall-inducing insects varies along the ontogeny of the host, and how gall density is influenced by mechanisms associated with host quality (plant height, plant shape, leaf area, specific leaf area, and hypersensitivity), and by mechanisms associated with their natural enemies (parasitoids, pathogens, and predators). In a remnant of Araucaria Forest, located in the Sao Francisco de Paula National Forest (Brazil), gall density (ind./100 g of leaf ) was obtained for 42 plants of C. aschersoniana divided into three height classes. Two galling species were recorded, showing quite distinct density patterns among height classes of C. aschersoniana. While Hymenoptera gall density decreased almost 50 times from small plants to canopy trees, Hemiptera gall density increased almost 10 times. Path analyses showed that Hymenoptera density was higher in smaller plants, independent of other host traits, while Hemiptera density was higher in plants exhibiting smaller leaves. Natural enemies were not detected in the Hemiptera population, and mortality rates due to predators, parasitoids, and pathogens did not affect Hymenoptera density. Processes associated with plant quality play the main role in generating the observed ontogenetic succession pattern.

AB Although spiders are a very diverse group on vegetation, their associations with plants are poorly known. Some salticid species specifically use Bromeliaceae as host plants in some regions of South America. In this study, I report the geographic range of these spider-bromeliad associations, and whether the spiders inhabit particular bromeliad species and vegetation types, as well as open areas or interior of forests. Nine salticid species were found to be associated with up to 23 bromeliad species in cerrados (savanna-like vegetation), semideciduous and seasonal forests, coastal sand dune vegetation, restingas, inselbergs, highland forests, chacos, and rain forests at 47 localities in Brazil, Paraguay, Bolivia, and Argentina. Some species were typically specialists, inhabiting almost exclusively one bromeliad species over a large geographic range (e.g., Psecas chapoda on Bromelia balansae), whereas others were generalists, occurring on up to 7-8 bromeliad species (e.g., Psecas sp., Eustiromastix nativo, and Coryphasia sp. 1). The regional availability of bromeliad species among habitats may explain this pattern of host plant use. More jumping spiders were found on bromeliads in open areas than on bromeliads in the interior of forests. These results show that several jumping spider species may be strictly associated with the Bromeliaceae in the Neotropics. This is one of the few studies to show host-specific associations for spiders on a particular plant type over a wide geographic range.

AB The relationship between forest succession and microfungal diversity has been poorly studied. Fungi provide important ecosystem services that may deteriorate in deforested or highly disturbed forests. To determine the possible effects of deforestation and forest succession on microfungi, species diversity of hypocrealean fungi (Ascomycota) was compared in forest stands in Eastern Costa Rica representing three stages of succession: 1-2, 25-27 yr old, and an old growth forest. Species diversity in a second-growth forest fragment surrounded by timber plantations and second-growth forest was also compared to that of a stand surrounded by old growth forest. The results show that the overall diversity of hypocrealean fungi was inversely proportional to the age of the forest stand, and each family showed different successional trends. Clavicipitaceae was more diverse in the old-growth forest and was positively related to the age of the forest stand. Nectriaceae was highly diverse in the 1- to 2-yr-old stand and less diverse in the old-growth stand. Saprobic and plant pathogenic fungal species were more diverse in the 1- to 2-yr-old stand and their diversity was inversely proportional to the age of the forest stand. The diversity of insect pathogens was positively related to the age of the forest stand. The 20- to 22-yr-old forest fragment had the lowest number of species overall. Based on the data gathered in this study, hypocrealean fungal species diversity is related to the successional stage and fragmentation of tropical forest.

AB Montane cloud forest (MCF) has high levels of species diversity, contributes positively to the catchment water yield, and is a globally threatened habitat type. The shortage of reliable data regarding the area currently occupied by MCF remains an obstacle to operational conservation planning in Mexico. This paper assesses how much MCF remains in the central Highlands of Chiapas (Mexico) and how fragmented it is in relation to other forest cover. We estimated that the area covered by MCF was between 3700-5250 ha. This estimate contrasted with the approximately 40,000 ha reported for the same region by the Mexican National Forestry inventory in 2000. MCF was highly scattered and fragmented within a matrix of other tropical montane forest types. Other forest types may be partially buffering the remaining MCF habitats, however, mitigating their disturbance and enhancing their connectivity. We conclude that mechanisms should be sought to promote the protection of core areas containing MCF fragments in agreement with communal and private landowners and to conserve the ecological functions of surrounding buffer zones. Such a conservation strategy would match the natural configuration of these endangered habitats.

AB We studied some feeding behaviors of the purple-throated fruitcrow (Querula purpurata) in two Colombian Amazonian forests, which affect the primary seed dispersal of the plants on which it feeds. Visit length, number of fruits removed and dispersed, feeding rates, and fruit-handling times were compared to those obtained for two other cotingas feeding on the same fruiting trees. Querula purpurata exhibited shorter visits (98 sec) and fruit-handling times (4 sec), and higher mean feeding rates (1.6 fruits/min) than Phoenicircus nigricollis and Cotinga cayana. In contrast, P. nigricollis dispersed the highest number of seeds of four of the five tree species studied. Although Q. purpurata and P. nigricollis exhibited feeding behaviors that increase seed dispersal, Q. purpurata may be more important in the transport of seeds between habitats, while P. nigricollis may be a major seed disperser within the primary forest.

AB Laughing falcon (Herpetotheres cachinnans) predation on coral snakes (Micrurus nigrocinctus) was recorded in two incidents that illustrate previously unreported variation in predatory behavior. In the first, the falcon held a live coral snake by the posterior end for an extended period of time, rather than decapitating it immediately. In the second, the falcon left a decapitated coral snake in a tree for more than 2 h before returning to recover its prey. A variety of behavioral adaptations may protect laughing falcons from coral snake venom.

AB We studied the effects of contrasting light environments on the relationship between the host plant size of Poulsenia armata and the abundance of two gall midges in a tropical rain forest in Veracruz, Mexico. The number and density of two gall morphs (i.e., laminar and vein-petiole galls) were positively correlated with plant size only in trees found in the forest but not in gaps. The availability of foliar area of P. armata trees was greater in forest gaps than in the forest. The foliar area was positively correlated with the abundance of laminar galls in trees in forest sites, but not with vein-petiole galls. We concluded that the abundance of two morphs of gall midges on P. armata was associated with host plant size only in the forest trees. Larger plants had more galls than small plants, although this relationship was affected by local light environments.

AB Deforestation and habitat loss are widely expected to precipitate an extinction crisis among tropical forest species. Humans cause deforestation, and humans living in rural settings have the greatest impact on extant forest area in the tropics. Current human demographic trends, including slowing population growth and intense urbanization, give reason to hope that deforestation will slow, natural forest regeneration through secondary succession will accelerate, and the widely anticipated mass extinction of tropical forest species will be avoided. Here, we show that the proportion of potential forest cover remaining is closely correlated with human population density among countries, in both the tropics and the temperate zone. We use United Nations population projections and continent-specific relationships between both total and rural population density and forest remaining today to project future tropical forest cover. Our projections suggest that deforestation rates will decrease as population growth slows, and that a much larger area will continue to be forested than previous studies suggest. Tropical forests retracted to smaller areas during repeated Pleistocene glacial events in Africa and more recently in selected areas that supported large prehistoric human populations. Despite many caveats, these projections and observations provide hope that many tropical forest species will be able to survive the current wave of deforestation and human population growth. A strategy to preserve tropical biodiversity might include policies to improve conditions in tropical urban settings to hasten urbanization and preemptive conservation efforts in countries with large areas of extant forest and large projected rates of future human population growth. We hope that this first attempt inspires others to produce better models of future tropical forest cover and associated policy recommendations.

The Xishuangbanna region has a typical monsoon climate with a mean annual temperature ranging between 15.1 degrees C and 21.7 degrees C, and precipitation between 1200 and 2500 mm. There is a pronounced dry season between November and April with frequent occurrence of heavy fog. Rainfall during the wet season between May and October accounts for over 80 percent of total annual precipitation. Water deposition from fog accounts for over one-third of total water input during the dry season in the forests, suggesting an important role that fog may play in pushing up the northern limit of tropical rain forest in Southeast Asia.

AB Xishuangbanna of southern Yunnan is biogeographically located at a transitional zone from tropical Southeast (SE) Asia to subtropical East Asia, and is at the junction of the Indian and Burmese plates of Gondwana and the Eurasian plate of Laurasia. The flora of the region consists of a recorded 3336 native seed plant species, belonging to 1140 genera in 197 families, among which 83.5 percent are tropical genera and 32.8 percent are endemic to tropical Asia, suggesting a strong affinity to tropical Asian flora. The vegetation of Xishuangbanna is organized into four forest types: tropical rain forest, tropical seasonal moist forest, tropical montane evergreen broad-leaved forest, and tropical monsoon forest. The tropical rain forest in Xishuangbanna has the same floristic composition of families and genera as some lowland equatorial rain forests in SE Asia, and is dominated (with a few exceptions) by the same families both in species richness and stem dominance. The exceptions include some deciduous trees in the canopy layer, fewer megaphanerophytes and epiphytes, and a higher abundance of lianas and microphyllic plants. We consider the tropical rain forest of Xishuangbanna as a type of tropical Asian rain forest, based on their conspicuous similarities in ecological and floristic characteristics.

AB Xishuangbanna is a region located at the northern edge of tropical Asia. Biomass estimates of its tropical rain forest have not been published in English literature. We estimated forest biomass and its allocation patterns in five 0.185-1.0 ha plots in tropical seasonal rain forests of Xishuangbanna. Forest biomass ranged from 362.1 to 692.6 Mg/ha. Biomass of trees with diameter at 1.3 m breast height (DBH) >= 5 cm accounted for 98.2 percent of the rain forest biomass, followed by shrubs (0.9%), woody lianas (0.8%), and herbs (0.2%). Biomass allocation to different tree components was 68.4-70.0 percent to stems, 19.8-21.8 percent to roots, 7.4-10.6 percent to branches, and 0.7-1.3 percent to leaves. Biomass allocation to the tree sublayers was 55.3-62.2 percent to the A layer (upper layer), 30.6-37.1 percent to the B layer (middle), and 2.7-7.6 percent to the C layer (lower). Biomass of Pometia tomentosa, a dominant species, accounted for 19.7-21.1 percent of the total tree biomass. The average density of large trees (DBH >= 100 cm) was 9.4 stems/ha on two small plots and 3.5 stems/ha on two large plots, illustrating the potential to overestimate biomass on a landscape scale if only small plots are sampled. Biomass estimations are similar to typical tropical rain forests in Southeast Asia and the Neotropics.

AB Dipterocarp rain forest reaches its northern latitudinal limit in Xishuangbanna, Southwest China. We studied the soil seedbank of dipterocarp rain forest in Xishuangbanna during the dry and wet seasons. Results showed that there were large seed accumulations in both the dry (mean +/- SD; 3925 +/- 2533 seeds/m(2)) and wet seasons (5415 +/- 3232 seeds/m(2)). One hundred and sixteen species of seed plants were identified from germination, 66 percent of which were woody species. Weed or pioneer species dominated the seedbank. The soil seedbank in Xishuangbanna had similar species composition as compared to those in tropical Asia, but higher seed storage reflects the intense disturbance and forest fragmentation in this area.

AB Leaf and fig phenology (including leafing, flowering, and fruiting) and syconium growth of Ficus racemosa were studied in Xishuangbanna, China. Leaffall and flushing of F. racemosa occurred twice yearly: in mid-dry season (December to March) and mid-rainy season (July to September). The adult leaf stage of the first leaf production was remarkably longer than that of the second. F. racemosa bears syconia throughout the year, producing 4.76 crops annually. Asynchronous fig production was observed at a population level. Fig production was independent of leafing. Fig production peaks were not evident, but fluctuation was clear. Diameter growth rates of syconium were normally higher in early developmental stages than in later stages, and reached a peak coinciding with the female flower phase. The mean +/- SD of syconium diameter of the female flower phase was 2.19 +/- 0.36 cm, and reached 3.67 +/- 0.73 cm of the male flower phase. Syconium diameter and receptacle cavity quickly enlarged at the female and male flower phases. Monthly diameter increment of the syconium was primarily affected by average monthly temperature, rather than rainfall or relative humidity.

AB We studied litter decomposition and nutrient release in a tropical seasonal rain forest of Xishuangbanna, Southwest China. The monthly decay rates (k) of leaf litter ranged from 0.02 to 0.21/mo, and correlated with rainfall and soil moisture. Annual k values for leaf litter (1.79/yr) averaged 4.2 times of those for coarse wood (2.5-3.5 cm in diameter). The turnover coefficients of forest floor mass (annual litterfall input/mean floor mass) were: 4.11/yr for flowers and fruits, 2.07/yr for leaves, and 1.17/yr for fine wood (<= 2 cm in diameter), with resident time decreasing from fine woods (0.85 yr) to leaves (0.48 yr) and to flower and fruits (0.24 yr). Nutrient residence times in the forest floor mass were ranked as: Ca (1.0 yr) > P (0.92 yr) > Mg (0.64 yr) > N (0.36 yr) > K (0.31 yr). Our data suggest that rates of litter decomposition and nutrient release in the seasonal rain forest of Xishuangbanna are slower than those in typical lowland rain forests, but similar to those in tropical semideciduous forests.

AB Decomposition is a critical process for nutrient release and accumulation of soil organic matter in disturbed soils, such as those found on landslides. I conducted a decomposition experiment on five landslides in the Luquillo Mountains of Puerto Rico as part of an investigation of the successional roles of two of the most common plant colonists to landslides, Cecropia schreberiana Miq. (Cecropiaceae) a pioneer tree species, and Cyathea arborea (L.) Sm. (Cyatheaceae) a pioneer tree fern. I compared leaf litter decomposition over one year and the initial and 1-yr chemistry for both species. Initial litter chemistry differed between the two species, as Cecropia had slightly higher nitrogen (9.2 mg/g) than Cyathea (8.2 mg/g) and higher lignin (28.6%) than Cyathea (26.0%), but water-soluble carbon and nonpolar extractable carbon (fats and oils, waxes, chlorophylls) were higher in Cyathea than Cecropia. Total carbon, acid-soluble carbon, total phosphorus, and pH did not differ significantly between leaf litter species. Across all five landslides, Cyathea (k= 0.93 +/- 0.06) leaves decomposed significantly faster than Cecropia (k= 0.68 +/- 0.06). The differences in these species leaf litter decomposition rates and chemical composition could potentially influence organic matter dynamics and nutrient cycling rates in these early successional systems.

AB We studied the ecological characteristics of 45-50-yr-old subtropical dry forest stands in Puerto Rico that were growing on sites that had been deforested and used intensively for up to 128 yr. The study took place in the Guanica Commonwealth Forest. Our objective was to assess the long-term effects of previous land use on this forest-i.e., its species composition, structure, and functioning. Previous land-use types included houses, farmlands, and charcoal pits. Stands with these land uses were compared with a nearby mature forest stand. The speed and path of forest recovery after deforestation and land-use abandonment depended on the conditions of the land. Study areas where land uses had removed the forest canopy and altered soil conditions (houses and farmlands) required a longer time to recover and had a different species composition than study areas where land uses retained a forest canopy (charcoal pits). Different forest attributes recovered at different rates. Crown area index, stem density, and litterfall rate recovered faster than stemwood and root, biomass, tree height, and basal area. Where previous land uses removed the canopy, Leucaena leucocephala, a naturalized alien pioneer species, dominated the regrowth. Native species dominated abandoned charcoal pits and mature forest. The change in species composition, including the invasion of alien species, appears to be the most significant long-term effect of human use and modification of the landscape.

AB Mangroves are prone to bearing frequently the full brunt of hurricanes and tropical storms. The extent of destruction and early regeneration are widely studied. The purpose of this study was to add a long-term view of mangrove regeneration and assess the potential effects on mangrove horizontal zonation patterns of catastrophic destruction. Hattie, a category five hurricane, hit the Belizean coast in 1961. It passed directly over the Turneffe Atoll where our study area, Calabash Cay, is located. At four sites on this island, we analyzed mangrove forest structure along transects parallel to the shoreline within zones delineated by species dominance and tree height. We propose an index based on the Simpson index of diversity to express changes in the heterogeneity of the species dominance. Physical-chemical parameters and nutrient availability were also measured. The destruction levels were estimated by analysis of the distribution of diameter at breast heights of the bigger trees in the inland zones. Variations in species dominance among sites and zones could be explained by interactions of various factors. Further, different levels of destruction between the two sides of the island had a significant effect on current patterns of species and structural zonation at Calabash. We conclude that disturbance regime in general should be considered as a factor potentially influencing mangrove horizontal zonation patterns.

AB The availability of exactly dated tree-ring chronologies is limited in tropical regions. However, these chronologies could contribute widely to studies of the influence of natural and human-induced factors on tropical forests. We examine the potential for building a chronology based on three sites in the miombo woodland of western Zambia. Brachystegia spiciformis Benth., a dominant species from this vegetation type, is used. Response of the chronology to several climatic factors is examined. All specimens showed very clear growth rings, and cross-dating between radii of a tree was successful for all trees. Site chronologies could be constructed after cross-dating of growth ring series of individual trees. The mean growth ring curves of the three sites were significantly similar, allowing for the construction of a regional chronology. Correlation function analysis between the tree-ring chronology and regional climatic variables revealed that climate at the core of the rainy season, in December and January, has an explicit influence on tree growth. Where precipitation and relative humidity in these months influence tree growth positively, temperature correlates in a negative way. Some 20 percent of the variance in the B. spiciformis tree-ring chronology is accounted for by wet season rainfall. The successful cross-dating and correlation between a tree-ring chronology and climate demonstrated in this study indicate annual ring formation in B. spiciformis trees and sensitivity to climatic conditions.

AB Pollinators, especially insects, could be influenced by forest fragmentation. The aim of this paper was to examine whether there were differences in 1) the communities of floral visitors; 2) the frequency of visits; and 3) the fruit and seed sets of individuals of Psychotria tenuinervis occurring at anthropogenic edges (AEs), natural edges (NEs), and in the forest interior (FI) in 2 yr of study. In 2002, the total number of flower visits was greater in NE and lower in AE, while no difference among habitats was found in 2003. There were differences among sample plots, within habitats, in both years. Bees were the most frequent visitors of P. tenuinervis flowers, and the introduced honeybee Apis mellifera was the most common species observed. There were no differences in the fruit and seed sets, or in the density of reproductive individuals of P. tenuinervis among habitats. However, in 2002, NE showed the greatest proportion of fruits per flower and AE the smallest. The similarity among the habitats was probably due to the marked variation or heterogeneity among the sample plots and among the plants within the habitats, which may have masked any interhabitat differences. The observed heterogeneity and the likely importance of other factors, such as gaps and the age of the edge, on the fragment studied, could be viewed as important issues for conservation programs.

AB We linked primary dispersal by spider monkeys (Ateles geoffroyi) and howler monkeys (Alouatta pigra) to post-dispersal seed fate by studying the effects of dung type and defecation pattern on secondary seed dispersal by dung beetles. First, we described the defecation patterns for both primate species. Howler monkeys generally defecated in groups (88% of observed defecations), with each individual producing on average 31 g of dung, resulting in a large area of the forest floor (31 m(2)) covered by large amounts of dung (clumped spatial pattern). Spider monkeys generally (96% of observed defecations) defecated individually, each individual producing an average of 11 g of dung, resulting in a small area of the forest floor (2 m(2)) covered by small amounts of dung (scattered spatial pattern). Secondly, we captured dung beetles using as bait the dung of both primate species, to detect differences in the assemblages of these secondary seed dispersers attracted to the dung of both primates. More individual dung beetles, but not more species, were attracted to howler monkey dung than to spider monkey dung. Finally, we assessed experimentally (using plastic beads as seed mimics) how dung type (Ateles vs. Alouatta) and defecation pattern (scattered vs. clumped) affect secondary seed dispersal by dung beetles. We found that post-dispersal seed fate was affected by dung type, with more seeds being buried when present in howler monkey dung, than in spider monkey dung, but was not affected by defecation pattern. It is important to consider post-dispersal processes, such as secondary seed dispersal by dung beetles, when comparing species of primary dispersers.

AB We studied roost structure, modification, and availability in Lophostoma silvicolum (Phyllostomidae), an insectivorous gleaning bat, on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama. Collection of nest material beneath termitaria and infrared video filming indicated that males of L. silvicolum excavate and maintain cavities inside active termite nests. A binary logistic regression analysis showed that to be suitable as roosts, termite nests have to be larger than 30 cm in diameter and taller than 30 cm, well shaded, with few transecting branches, and freely accessible from below. Use of active termite nests as roosts may provide several benefits to L. silvicolum, including reduction of competition for roost sites with sympatric bat species, reduced parasite load and a suitable microclimate. A comparison of number of all termite nests in selected forest plots with number of termite nests that are potentially suited as bat roosts and number of termite nests that are actually used by bats suggests that L. silvicolum may not be roost-limited on BCI in spite of its highly specialized roost choice.

AB Endozoochorous seed dispersal by kerama deer (Cervus nippon keramae) was investigated at four sites on Aka Island, the Ryukyu Archipelago, Japan. Kerama deer feces contained seeds of 35 plant species. Most of the germinated seeds were small (1.3 +/- 0.18 mm) and had a hard coat, comparable to the germinated seeds in several other studies of endozoochorous seed dispersal by herbivores. Both the numbers and species compositions of seeds differed among the four sites, reflecting differences in the food available to kerama deer among habitats. Although many graminoid seeds were found in the two open habitats (Sites A and B) and in the adjoining forest habitat (Site C), woody plant seeds dispersed endozoochorously by birds and mammals were dominant in the forest (Site D), away from the marsh. Although a majority of the graminoid species was growing in open habitats such as the marsh and open fields, few were growing in the forest. Therefore, the kerama deer spread many open-habitat graminoid seeds to the open and forest habitats. If a high density of kerama deer persists for a long time and gaps in forests are created by browsing kerama deer or by other means, graminoid species may spread substantially on Aka Island. Therefore, it is possible that seed dispersal by forest deer contributes to the expansion of grasslands.

AB Norops polylepis is a common anoline lizard that occupies both forest and pasture habitats at various elevations in southern Costa Rica. Previous studies have documented significant spatial variation in mite loads (Eutrombicula chiggers) on N. polylepis. My objective was to investigate whether mite load has a negative impact on growth rates and body condition. Growth rates were estimated in three sites using mark-recapture with three intensive sampling periods over 12 mo. Nine hundred and forty lizards were captured and 200 individuals were recaptured across sampling periods. Mite load was significantly higher in forests than in pastures, and varied significantly among study sites. Males grew faster than females, and females and juveniles had higher body condition than males. I was unable, however, to detect any influence of mite load on growth rates or body condition. I conclude that Eutrombicula chiggers are either largely benign for N. polylepis or, if they do exert a negative effect on fitness, it is mediated through a trait other than growth or body condition.

AB The leaf litter of tropical wet forests is replete with itinerant ant nests. Nest movement may help ants evade the constraints of stress and disturbance and increase access to resources. I studied how nest relocation and environmental factors may explain the density, size, and growth of leaf litter ant nests. I decoupled the relationships among litter depth, food abundance, and nest availability in a 4-mo manipulation of food and leaf litter in a community of litter-nesting ants in a lowland wet forest in Costa Rica. Over 4 mo, 290 1 m(2) treatment and control plots were sampled without replacement. Nest densities doubled in response to food supplementation, but did not decrease in response to litter removal or stress (from litter trampling). The supplementation of food increased the utilization of less favored nesting materials. In response to food supplementation and litter trampling, arboreal ants established nests in the litter, and growth rates of the most common ants (Pheidole spp.) increased. Colony growth was independent of colony size and growth rates of the most abundant ants. In general, I conclude that litter-nesting ant density is driven primarily by food limitation, that nest relocation behavior significantly affects access to resource and the demographic structure of this community, and that nest fission may be a method to break the growth-reproduction trade-off.

AB The planting of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) in the understory of tropical forests is promoted in many regions as a strategy to conserve forested lands and meet the economic needs of rural communities. While the forest canopy is left intact in most understory plantations, much of the midstory and understory vegetation is removed in order to increase light availability for cultivated species. We assessed the extent to which the removal of vegetation in understory plantations of Chamaedorea hooperiana Hodel (Arecaceae) alters understory light conditions. We also examined how any changes in light availability may be reflected by changes in the composition of canopy tree seedlings regenerating in understory plantations. We employed a blocked design consisting of four C. hooperiana plantation sites; each site was paired with an adjacent, unmanaged forest site. Hemispherical canopy photographs were taken and canopy tree seedlings were identified and measured within 12 3 x 2 m randomly placed plots in each site for a total of 96 plots (4 blocks x 2 sites x 12 plots). Plantation management did not affect canopy openness or direct light availability but understory plantations had a higher frequency of plots with greater total and diffuse light availability than unmanaged forest. Comparisons of canopy tree seedling composition between understory plantations and unmanaged forest sites were less conclusive but suggest that management practices have the potential to increase the proportion of shade-intolerant species of tree seedlings establishing in plantations. Given the importance of advanced regeneration in gap-phase forest dynamics, these changes may have implications for future patterns of succession in the areas of forest where NTFPs are cultivated.

AB We compared the allometry of two contrasting late-successional dipterocarp species to test whether a monolayer (shade-tolerant)-multilayer (shade-intolerant) model applies to pole-sized trees. Crown traits of the more shade-tolerant species (Vatica micrantha) did not conform to either of the familiar monolayer or multilayer models for pole-sized trees, but instead were consistent with a "persistent multilayer" model. Species differences in crown traits may be influenced more by future rather than present light environments.

AB Changes in tree, liana, and understory plant diversity and community composition in five tropical rain forest fragments varying in area (18-2600 ha) and disturbance levels were studied on the Valparai plateau, Western Ghats. Systematic sampling using small quadrats (totaling 4 ha for trees and lianas, 0.16 ha for understory plants) enumerated 312 species in 103 families: 1968 trees (144 species), 2250 lianas (60 species), and 6123 understory plants (108 species). Tree species density, stem density, and basal area were higher in the three larger (> 100 ha) rain forest fragments but were negatively correlated with disturbance scores rather than area per se. Liana species density, stem density, and basal area were higher in moderately disturbed and lower in heavily disturbed fragments than in the three larger fragments. Understory species density was highest in the highly disturbed 18-ha fragment, due to weedy invasive species occurring with rain forest plants. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling and Mantel tests revealed significant and similar patterns of floristic variation suggesting similar effects of disturbance on community compositional change for the three life-forms. The five fragments encompassed substantial plant diversity in the regional landscape, harbored at least 70 endemic species (3.21% of the endemic flora of the Western Ghats-Sri Lanka biodiversity hotspot), and supported many endemic and threatened animals. The study indicates the significant conservation value of rain forest fragments in the Western Ghats, signals the need to protect them from further disturbances, and provides useful benchmarks for restoration and monitoring efforts.

AB To the discussion on secondary succession in tropical forests, we bring data on three under-addressed issues: understory as well as overstory changes, continuous as opposed to phase changes, and integration of forest succession with indigenous fallow management and plant uses. Changes in vegetation structure and species composition were analyzed in secondary forests following swidden agriculture in a semideciduous forest of Bolivian lowlands. Twenty-eight fallows, stratified by four successional stages (early = 1-5 yr, intermediate = 6-10 yr, advanced = 12-20 yr, and older = 22-36 yr), and ten stands of mature forests were sampled. The overstory (plants >= 5 cm diameter at breast height [DBH]) was sampled using a 20 x 50 m plot and the understory (plants < 5 cm DBH) in three nested 2 x 5 m subplots. Semistructured interviews provided information on fallow management. Canopy height, basal area, and liana density of the overstory increased with secondary forest age. The early stage had the lowest species density and diversity in the overstory, but the highest diversity in the understory. Species composition and abundance differentiated mature forests and early successional stage from other successional stages; however, species showed individualistic responses across the temporal gradient. A total of 123 of 280 species were useful with edible, medicinal, and construction plants being the most abundant for both over- and understories. Most of Los Gwarayo preferred mature forests for making new swidden, while fallows were valuable for crops, useful species, and regenerating timber species.

AB I assessed the role of low vegetation (plants ca 1 yr old and <= 50 cm tall) as a biotic facilitator or barrier in the recruitment of different growth forms and species in primary forests, secondary forests, and old-fields (abandoned pastures) in southeastern Mexico. I removed by hand all plants (<= 100 cm tall, including roots) and litter from 20, 0.25 m(2) plots in each habitat. For 1 yr, I counted the number of plant species (5-50 cm tall) recruited, grouped them into different growth forms, and compared them to undisturbed control plots. Prior to manipulation, the standing density of trees and lianas was highest in primary and secondary forests. Shrubs were more abundant in secondary forests, whereas herbs, epiphytes, and hemi-epiphytes were more abundant in old-fields. Herbaceous plants appeared as important components of the community in all habitats. The removal of low vegetation increased total plant recruitment in all habitats. Considering each growth form, the absence of vegetation increased recruitment in primary forests for herbs, in secondary forests for epiphytes and hemi-epiphytes, in old-fields for trees, and for lianas in primary forests and old-fields. In vegetation removal plots, recruitment of species was greater in pastures, lower in secondary forest, and similar in primary forest with respect to control plots. Depending on habitat type, species, and growth form, the presence of low vegetation may act as a recruitment barrier or facilitator for different species, affecting plant community structure, diversity, and composition in different habitats.

AB We compared the diversity, taxonomic composition, and pollination syndromes of bromeliad assemblages and the diversity and abundance of hummingbirds along two climatically contrasting elevational gradients in Bolivia. Elevational patterns of bromeliad species richness differed noticeably between transects. Along the continuously wet Carrasco transect, species richness peaked at mid-elevations, whereas at Masicuri most species were found in the hot, semiarid lowlands. Bromeliad assemblages were dominated by large epiphytic tank bromeliads at Carrasco and by small epiphytic, atmospheric tillandsias at Masicuri. In contrast to the epiphytic taxa, terrestrial bromeliads showed similar distributions across both transects. At Carrasco, hummingbird-pollination was the most common pollination mode, whereas at Masicuri most species were entomophilous. The proportion of ornithophilous species increased with elevation on both transects, whereas entomophily showed the opposite pattern. At Carrasco, the percentage of ornithophilous bromeliad species was significantly correlated with hummingbird abundance but not with hummingbird species richness. Bat-pollination was linked to humid, tropical conditions in accordance with the high species richness of bats in tropical lowlands. At Carrasco, mixed hummingbird/bat-pollination was found especially at mid-elevations, i.e., on the transition between preferential bat-pollination in the lowlands and preferential hummingbird-pollination in the highlands. In conclusion, both richness patterns and pollination syndromes of bromeliad assemblages varied in distinct and readily interpretable ways in relation to environmental humidity and temperature, and bromeliad pollination syndromes appear to follow the elevational gradients exhibited by their pollinators.

AB We examined whether the experimental exclusion of large mammalian and small rodent seed predators had differing effects on seedling recruitment under natural seed rain conditions. In both primary and late-successional secondary forested areas, exclosure experiments using natural seed densities were designed to assess seedling recruitment. To assess the differences in seedling recruitment, we monitored three exclosure treatments (1.2 m radius/1.5 m height) in two forest types (primary vs. late-successional secondary forest): (1) fenced exclosures that excluded large mammals; (2) fenced exclosures that excluded both large and small mammals; and (3) open controls. Within each exclosure treatment, we marked and identified all seedlings at the beginning of the experiment (February 2001), followed the marked seedlings' fate for a year, and then marked and identified all new seedlings after a year. Two preliminary findings were generated from these data: for some tree species, small rodents and large mammals have differential effects on seedling recruitment, and the effect of excluding mammals did not differ with habitat type (primary vs. late-successional secondary forest). These preliminary results highlight the need to examine further how the effects of small rodent and large mammal exclusion may affect species-specific seed predation and seedling recruitment in a variety of habitat/land use types (e.g., primary forest, late-successional forest, and early-successional forest).

AB In the coastal semideciduous forest of La Mancha, Veracruz (Mexico), we evaluated the removal of fallen fruits and seeds of different species by the land crab Gecarcinus lateralis under different environmental conditions (age soil of forest stand, topography, and cover). Crabs removed 67 percent of the propagules in the experiments (3106 of a total of 4608), and seeds were removed in greater quantities (61.1%) than fruits (38.9%). Fruits of Maclura tinctoria (Moraceae) and Ehretia tinifolia (Boraginacea) and seeds of E. tinifolia were the most affected species. Crabs removed higher quantities of fruits in old-soil forest and in the understory than in young-soil forest and gaps. In experiments with seeds, only for the older forest, the crabs removed more seeds in slopes and peaks than in valleys and in the understory than gaps, whereas in the young-soil forest, the differences were not significant. Our results suggest that G. lateralis, like Gecarcoidea natalis and Gecarcinus quadratus, is an efficient propagule predator and can exert pressure in the establishment of plant species, but in La Mancha, this also depends on site conditions and identity of the species.

AB Honey-making bee colonies in Bwindi Impenetrable National Park were investigated with Batwa Pygmies locating 228 nests of Apis and five stingless bees (Meliponini). The relative importance of predation, food supply, nesting site, and elevation affecting abundance were studied for meliponines in particular. Nest predation and overall nest abundance had no correlation with elevation along a 1400 m gradient, nor did flowering phenology or pollen collection. Many suitable, large trees were unoccupied by bee nests. In 174 ha of forest plots, 2 Meliponula lendliana, 13 M. nebulata, 16 M. ferruginea, 16 M. bocandei, and 20 Apis mellifera adansonii nests occurred, suggesting a habitat-wide density of 39 nests/km(2). Compared to other studies, Ugandan Meliponini were uncommon (0.27 colonies/ha, tropical mean = 1.9/ha), while Apis mellifera was numerous (0.12 nests/ha, tropical mean = 0.06/ha), despite park policy allowing humans to exploit Apis. Meliponine colony mortality from predators averaged 12 percent/yr and those near ground were most affected. Tool-using humans and chimpanzees caused 82 percent of stingless bee nest predation. Selective factors affecting nest heights and habit may include auditory hunting by predators for buzzing bees, and indirect mutualists such as termites that leave potential nesting cavities. Mobility and free-nesting by honey bee colonies should enable rapid community recovery after mortality, especially in parks where human honey hunting is frequent, compared to sedentary and nest-site-bound Meliponini.

AB Post-logging seedling regeneration density by big-leaf mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla), a nonpioneer light-demanding timber species, is generally reported to be low to nonexistent. To investigate factors limiting seedling density following logging within the study region, we quantified seed production rates, germinability, dispersal patterns, and seed fates on the forest floor through germination and the first seedling growing season in southeastern Amazonia, Brazil. Fruit production rates were low by three logged and one unlogged populations compared to reports from other regions. Commercial-sized trees (> 60 cm diameter) were more fecund than noncommercial trees (30-60 cm diameter) at two sites, averaging 14.5 vs. 3.9 fruits/tree/year, respectively, at Marajoara, a logged site, over 8 yr. Fruit capsules contained an average of 60.3 seeds/fruit, 70 percent of which appeared viable by visual inspection. Sixty-seven to 72 percent of apparently viable seeds germinated in nursery beds 2.5 mo after the dispersal period, when wet season rains began. Dry season winds blew most seeds west-northwest of parent trees, with median dispersal distances of 28 and 9 m on west and east sides of parent trees, respectively. Nearly 100 percent of seeds fell within an area of 0.91 ha. On the forest floor beneath closed canopies, mammals, invertebrates, and fungal pathogens killed 40 percent of apparently viable seeds, while 36 percent germinated. Nine months after seedling establishment-midway through the first logging season following seed dispersal-14 percent of outplanted seeds survived as seedlings, representing 5.8 seeds/fruit. We conclude that seedlings are likely to survive in logging gaps at appreciable densities only in rare cases where previous year fruit production rates by logged trees were high (4-12.5% of commercial-sized trees/year at Marajoara) and where tree crowns were felled in west or northwest directions.

ID BARRO-COLORADO ISLAND; INSECTIVOROUS BIRDS; EXTINCTIONS; RICHNESS;

AB I tested whether terrestrial/understory habits, large body sizes, low tolerance to edge or to matrix habitat, and food/habitat specialization are characteristics of the most vulnerable bird species based on point counts conducted in 14 forest fragments in northern Parana, southern region of the Brazilian Atlantic forest. In addition, the sensitivity level of each bird species to forest fragmentation in northern Parana (high, medium, and low) was compared to the Vicosa region, another fragmented landscape of the Atlantic forest. Contrary to expectations, large body size and terrestrial/understory habits were not features clearly related to high sensitivity to forest fragmentation; but species with tolerance to edge did have lower sensitivity. I found also that specialized habitat/food were not good predictors of extinctions; the most specialized guilds, bamboo and vine-tangle insectivores and trunk and twig insectivores, had a high number of species with low sensitivity. Patterns of sensitivity were compared for 75 bird species that occurred in both northern Parana and Vicosa; higher incongruence occurred for 14 and 7 species considered as highly sensitive in Vicosa but were of medium or low sensitivity, respectively, in northern Parana. These differences may occur because sensitivity to habitat fragmentation may vary from the center to the periphery of a species' geographic range. Geographic variation in patterns of sensitivity to forest fragmentation may be important for conservation planning.

AB We studied physiognomy-specific (i.e., gaps vs. understory) responses of birds to low harvest (18.7 m(3)/ha), reduced-impact logging by comparing 3500 mist net captures in control and cut blocks of an Amazonian terra firme forest in Brazil at 20-42 mo postharvest. Species richness did not differ significantly between control (92 species) and cut (85) forest based on rarefaction to 1200 captures. Fifty-six percent of all species were shared between control and cut forest, compared to the 64 percent shared between control blocks. Higher captures of nectarivores and frugivores in cut forest likely occurred as a consequence of postharvest resource blooms. Higher captures of some insectivores in cut as compared to control forest were unexpected, attributable to increased wandering or shifts from association with midstory to understory as a consequence of habitat alteration. Logging influenced capture rates for 21 species, either consistently, or via positive interaction with physiognomy or time (13 species higher in cut forest and 8 species higher in control forest). Cut understory sites had lower diversity (H') and scaled dominance than understory and gap sites in control forest. Temporal changes in captures may have resulted from successional dynamics in cut forest: two guilds and three species increased in abundance. Increases in abundances of guilds and particular species were more prevalent in control than in cut forest, suggesting that logging displaced birds to control forest. In general, the effects of logging were relatively minor; low harvest rates and reduced-impact methods may help to retain aspects of avian biodiversity in Amazon forest understories.

AB A recent increase in published studies of lianas has been paralleled by a proliferation of protocols for censusing lianas. This article seeks to increase uniformity in liana inventories by providing specific recommendations for the determination of which taxa to include, the location of diameter measurement points on individual stems, the setting of minimum stem diameter cutoffs, the treatment of multiple-stemmed and rooted clonal groups, and the measurement of noncylindrical stems. Use of more uniform liana censusing protocols may facilitate comparison of independently collected data sets and further our understanding of global patterns in liana abundance, diversity, biomass, and dynamics.

Lianas reached the canopy at significantly smaller size-classes (1.5 cm) in the wet aseasonal forest, suggesting that this estimate changes with forest type. Nevertheless, as a general rule, we suggest that 2.0 cm is the minium stem diameter to examine the abundance and diversity of canopy lianas or canopy competition between lianas and trees.

Values derived from the canopy-surveyed plots were higher than fruit-trap estimates. Fruiting patterns obtained throughout both methods were not correlated. Our results showed that the fruit-trap method does not accurately reflect fruiting patterns occurring at the highest levels of the forest, while the canopy-surveyed plots provided both quantitative and qualitative information on canopy fruit production, and each species contribution.

AB We quantified nectar-robbing in two ornithophilus plant species by marking and monitoring robbed flowers and unrobbed flowers of each plant until fruit production. Significantly more marked unrobbed Cavendishia pubescens flowers successfully matured fruits than their robbed counterparts, while fruit set did not differ significantly between robbed and unrobbed flowers of Fuchsia venusta. In C. pubescens, birds of species known to be legitimate visitors sometimes behaved as secondary nectar robbers; conspecific birds handled flowers of F. venusta consistently. This behavioral change may contribute to the observed negative effect of nectar-robbing on reproduction of C. pubescens.

AB Scarlet Macaw diet was determined during the breeding season of February-June 1998. Macaws were primarily granivorous, exhibiting a narrow diet during the dry season, with low variety of food items in adult and nestling diets. Seeds of Cnidoscolus spp. and Schizolobium parahybum, tree species characteristic of floodplain forest, were predominant in nestling diets, and may provide protein-rich food resources. River floodplains provided important nest sites and food resources for Scarlet Macaws during the breeding season.

AB Sucrose, glucose, and fructose are the three sugars that commonly occur ill floral nectar and fruit pulp. The relative proportions of these three Sugars in nectar and fruit in relation to the sugar preferences of pollinators and seed dispersers have received considerable attention. Based oil the research of Herbert and Irene Baker and their collaborators, a dichromy between sucrose-dominant humming-bird-pollinated flowers and hexose-dominant passerine flowers and fruits was proposed. Data oil sugar preferences of several hummingbird species (which prefer Sucrose) vs. a smaller sample of passerines (which prefer hexoses) nearly fitted this apparent dichotomy. This hummingbird-passerine dichoromy was strongly emphasized until the discovery Of Smith African plants with sucrose-dominant nectars, which arc pollinated by passerines that are able to digest, and prefer Sucrose. Now we know that, with the exception of two clades, most passerines are able to assimilate Sucrose. Most sugar preference studies have been conducted using a single, relatively high, sugar concentration in the nectar (ca 20%). Thus, we lack information about the role that sugar-concentration might play in Sugar Selection. Because many digestive traits are strongly affected nor only by sugar composition, but also by Sugar concentration, we suggest that preferences or different sugar compositions are concentration-dependent. Indeed, recent studies on Several unrelated nectar-feeding birds have found a distinct switch from hexose preference at low concentrations to sucrose preference at higher concentrations. Finally. we present some hypotheses about the role that birds could have played in molding the sugar composition of plant rewards.

AB We monitored Survival of seedlings in 216 I-m(2) quadrats in lowland rain forest in tropical north Queensland between December 2001 and December 2002. During this time, the region experienced severe drought associated with air El Nino Southern Oscillation event. Tire 2001 census recorded 124 species and 2912 individuals. In late November 2002 (2 wk prior to the second census), a low intensity fire passed through approximately half of the study site removing all evidence of seedlings from I 10 plots. Only 482 (17%) individuals and 64 (52%) species recorded in 2001 survived the 12-mo period. In 96 quadrats riot affected by fire, mortality was high, but considerably variable between species. Six of the 20 most abundant species in 2001 experienced mortality rates higher than the community average and two of the most abundant species showed rates lower than average. Overall, conditions experienced during 2002 caused significant changes in the rank abundances of species between censuses. Mortality due to fire was less severe and mortality, more uniform across species, resulting ill significant concordance between pre and postfire rankings, once the effects of drought had been considered. Our results provide the first indication of how differences ill Survival after a perturbation predicted to become more frequent in future global climates may alter the size and species composition of the seedling bank in Australian tropical rain forests.

AB Plant establishment and growth oil rocky outcrops in the Itatiaia massif (2400 m a.s.l.), southeastern Brazil, are limited by tack of soil and by freezing temperatures in winter nights. Mat-forming species of different sizes and shapes oil bare rock provide substrate for other plants to establish. The habitat preference of two geophytes, Stevia camporian (Asteraceae) and Alstroemeria foliosa (Alstroemeriaceae), was compared with regard to their association with the type of mat species and distinct rock topographies. The habitat preference of the mar species in regard to topography was also assessed. We found 1706 ramets of S. camparum and 1317 of A. foliosa in 253 vegetation islands ranging in size from 0.005 to 18.097 m(2). Mat species in these islands were Fernseea itatiaiae, Vriesea itatiaiae (both Bromeliaccae), Pleurostima gounelleana (Velloziaceae) and/or Campylopus pilifer (Dicranaceae) and other mosses. Mat species were segregated by topography. Geophytes were similarly distributed across types of topography but showed negative interspecific association. S. camportum Occurred mostly oil the moss-dominated islands, whereas A. foliosa was more common in P.gounelleana islands. We found geophyte co-occurrence in larger vegetation islands containing both P.gounelleana and mosses as mat species. Thus, the effect of topography on geophyte segregation was indirect, since topography affects mat species distribution, and the geophyte preference for distinct mat species as substrate resulted in their segregation.

AB We investigated ecophysiological and morphological traits affecting light and water use of four commercially important pendant epiphytic bryophyte species in a montane oak-bamboo forest in Costa Rica. predictions based mostly oil ecophysiological studies of temperate bryophytes and vascular plants were experimentally tested or tropical montane bryophyte species ranked on the basis of their distributions in the canopy from the most protected (1) to the most exposed sites (4): (1) Phyllogonium viscosum; (2) Pilotrichella flexilis; (3) Dendropogonella rufescens; and (4) Frullania convoluta. As, predicted, highly exposed species tended to have higher light saturation and compensation points, higher dark respiration rates, more chlorophyll, higher chlorophyll a:b ratios, and higher nitrogen concentrations. Contrary to predicted trends, exposed-site species had lower water contents at full saturation; there were no detectable differences among species in the race of water loss. Rates of carbon gain in all species reached asymptotes with increasing water content, but the moisture compensation point For carbon uptake of the moss D. rufescens was substantially higher than in the other species. Observed patterns result from interactions among processes related to water storage and transport operating at different scales and are determined by various morphological traits including the density, size, and disposition of phylloids, as Well as by whole-clump architecture.

AB Successional patterns of microfungi on decaying leaves of Ficus pleurocarpa were assessed as part of a study to enumerate microfungi in tropical rain forest leaf litter. Leaves degraded into fragments over a period of 3 mo. Two methods were applied, a direct observational method and a particle filtration protocol. Using a direct method, 104 species were observed, while 53 sporulating taxa and 100 sterile morphotaxa were isolated by [)article filtration. Overall patterns of succession were confirmed by both methods, but the relative abundance of species detected differed between the two methods. Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling identified at least four successional stages and suggested that microfungal communi ties increased in similarity with advancing decay. Data collected by the direct method indicated a slow but steady decline of diversity with advancing decay, whereas all increase in diversity was detected by particle filtration. Synecological succession Studies provide a useful tool to identify patterns and generate hypotheses. Understanding the underlying causes of successional patterns will require further autecological studies.

AB This study reports the effect of daily mean ambient temperature on daily activity and habitat use by the giant anteater (Myrmerophaga tridactyla) in the Pantanal wetlands of Brazil. We equipped I I giant anteaters with a global position system collar programmed to acquire a location every 10 min for 15 d. A temperature data logger left in the meteorological station at the study site registered data on ambient temperature. Giant anteaters were mainly active in open fields except during the coldest days, when they, sought protection inside forests. Giant anteaters also used open habitats for resting but during the hottest or chilliest days the), sheltered in forests. In the Pantanal, where temperatures are usually high, giant anteaters were active all night long, but as daily average ambient temperature decreased anteaters began and finished activity progressively earlier and reduced total activity As a consequence, time spent active it daylight increased progressively and time spent active during the night decreased progressively, probably to allow the anteaters to expose themselves to solar radiation and to avoid heat loss during the night.

AB I compared the effectiveness of sympatric brown howlers (Alouatta guariba) and muriquis (Brachyteles arachnoides) as seed dispersers in terms of quantitative and qualitative attributes. 1 hypothesized chat differences in feeding and behavioral patterns between these large-bodied folivorous/frugivorous primates would lead to dissimilarities in their effectiveness as endozoochoric seed dispersal agents. The study was carried out in a semideciduous Forest Fragment of Fazenda Barreiro Rico, southeastern Brazil. Through behavioral sampling of frugvory and defecation events as well as analyses of fecal samples, I determined that A. guariba dispersed fewer species and produced a lower proportion Of Clung with intact seeds than B. arachnoides. There was no difference between the number of seeds in fecal samples of A. guariba and B. arachnoides. These primates affected to a similar degree both germination percentage and latency to germination of seeds they ingested or removed the pull) from. Howlers and muriquis Were also similar in carrying seeds away from the parent trees. Contrary to muriquis, howlers defecated seeds under the canopy of conspecific lianas, where seeds are expected to stiffer high mortality rates, and voided seeds predominantly in a clumped pattern. B. arachnoides was a more effective seed disperser when compared to A. guariba in some attributes evaluated, but not in others. Given the interspecific variation in recruitment patterns of tropical plants and the loss of frugivorous bird species at the study, site, rile differences between howlers and muriquis in their abilities as seed dispersers may, crucially influence the composition and maintenance of seedling diversity.

AB Tracking the dispersal of seeds by, fruit-eating animals in tropical rain forests is crucia to further our understanding of plant-firugivore interactions and their no pacts upon forest regeneration and plant population dynamics. We tested the feasibility of tracking bar-dispersed seeds in a Philippine lowland rain forest with the help of fluorescent Pigment. The powder was mixed with acetone and sprayed to ripe fruits of fig trees, i.e., Ficus septica and F variegata. During nightly monitoring using a hand-held ultraviolet lamp bat deposits (seed-containing spat outs and feces) could successfully be detected. Distances and directions of deposit sites to the focal trees were recorded and seed shadow areas were analyzed. Bats dispersed most of the seeds less than 50 in away from the parent plants resulting in seed shadow areas < 0.30 ha in size. An in situ fruit preference experiment showed that fluorescent powder is unlikely to deter bats from feeding on ripe figs. In Conclusion, the technique is simple, inexpensive, noninvasive, applicable to different fields of research and allows one to follow the fate of seeds from known sources.

AB We studied activity patterns of long-legged bats, Macrophyllum macrophyllum (Phyllostomidae), in the Barro Colorado Nature Monument, Panama, using radio-telemetry. Activity of four males and five females equipped with radio-transmitters were monitored for 4-7 entire nights each between April and July 2002. Bats exhibited maximum activity around dusk and high activity during the night. Males and females foraged for equal amounts of time in continuous flight (mean: 7 min, maximum 1 h) with interspersed resting phases (mean: 15 min, maximum 3 h). Activity of M. macrophyllum was sensitive to several factors. Time of emergence and return to day roost were correlated with time of sunset and sunrise, respectively. Maximum bat activity coincided with high abundance of aerial insects. Finally, heavy rain caused bats to reduce or cease flight activity. Direct observations and field video recordings support the assumption that M. macrophyllum employs two distinct foraging modes: trawling of insects from and capture of aerial insects at low heights above water. Combination of foraging modes gives M. macrophyllum high flexibility and efficiency in prey search. Activity, foraging mode, and morphology, which are similar to trawling bats from other families, distinguish M. macrophyllum from all other phyllostomid species and grant it access to open habitat above water, a habitat no other phyllostomid bat has conquered.

AB We described the plants used as roost resources by Artibeus watsoni in souchwestern Costa Rica, assessed roost fidelity, and compared roosting ecology between two sites, Golfito and Corcovado, which vary in the degree of human influence. A total of 349 tents front 25 different plant species were used by A. watsoni as roosts: some plant species (e.g., Carludovica palmata, Asplundia alata, Heliconia imbricata and Calathea lutea) were modified into tents with significantly higher frequency than others. The highest tents above the ground were observed in Philodendron popenoei and Rhodospatha wendlandii, whereas tents it) Philodendron grandipes and A. alata were significantly lower than any other species. Asplundia alata and R. wendlandii also had the highest Frequency of leaves modified pet-plant. fidelity of bats to tents was low, although bats Used several cents intermittently within a restricted area. Males general]), were more faithful to tents than females, although not significantly so. This observation, along with indirect evidence of leaf modification, suggests chat males; are primarily responsible for tent construction. The two study sites differed in the plants Used for roosting and in tent fidelity. Bats in Corcovado used a greater variety of plant species for tent roosting, whereas bats in Golfito were more faithful, suggesting that roosting resources were scarcer at the latter site.

AB Madagascar has a distinctive fruit bar community consisting of Pteropus rufus, Eidolon dupreanum, and Rousettus madagascariensis. In this study, we observed fruit bat visits to flowering baobabs (Adansonia suarezensis and Adansonia grandideri) and kapok trees (Ceiba pentandra) during the austral winter. Eidolon dupreanum was recorded feeding on the nectar of baobabs and kapok, P rufus was observed Feeding oil kapok only and no R. madagascariensis were seen. Three mammals species, two small lemurs (Phaner furcifer and Mirza coquereli) and E. dupreanum, made nondestructive visits to flowering A. grandidieri and are therefore all potential pollinators of this endangered baobab. This is the first evidence to show that A. grandidieri is bit-pollinated and Further demonstrates the close link between fruit bats and some of Madagascars endemic plants. Eidolon dupreanum was the only mammal species recorded visiting A. suarezensis and visits peaked at the reported limes of maximum nectar concentration. Pteropus rufus visited kapok mostly before midnight when most nectar was available, but E. dupreanum visited later in the night. These differences in timing of foraging on kapok can be explained either by differing distances from the roost sites of each species or by resource partitioning. We advocate increased levels of protection, education awareness, and applied research oil both mammal-pollinated baobab species and fruit bats, and suggest that both baobabs and bats are candidate "flagship species" for the threatened city forests of Madagascar.

AB We used plot-level manipulations and analyses to test the effects of food availability on the behavior and condition of resident dry-forest birds in Jamaica. Two control plots were monitored in each of 2 yr. Food was Supplemented on five plots over 2 yr with piles of cut oranges distributed around plots, which served as a direct source of carbobydrates and water, and an indirect Source of ground arthropods due to increased above-ground activity. We reduced ants on five plots over 2 yr; however, We found no difference in total ground arthropod biomass between control and reduction treatments, so we pooled these plots For analysis. We selected nine focal resident bird species for study of relative abundance, body condition, and breeding condition. Birds were sampled prior to, and 5 to 6 weeks after the initiation of treatments. Seven of nine species had higher relative abundance following food supplementation. Three species were recaptured more frequently in supplementation plots than in control plots. These abundance and persistence responses did not Cause any changes in body condition. In one species, Bananaquit (Coereba flaveola), food supplementation resulted in higher concentrations of individuals in breeding condition. These results demonstrated Functional response to dry-season food availability and suggest a limiting mechanism. This Study helps explain mechanisms by which bird populations respond to resource availibility, and is the first Successful plot-level food supplementation experiment for tropical forest birds.

AB We measured beta diversity, or turnover in species composition, OF ant assemblages inhabiting patches of forest and savanna (cerrado) near Alter do Chao, in the Brazilian Amazon. In addition, we assessed vertical partitioning of these assemblages by comparing the ground and lower vegetation strata within each habitat. Ants attracted to sardine baits were collected along transects in 39 savanna and 34 forest sites scattered over a 16 km x 16 km landscape. There were about twice as mail), species in the forest as in the savanna, and within both habitats, we collected more species Oil the ground than in the vegetation. Similar results were obtained when analyzing data at the level Of individual transects, indicating that ant species richness is affected by both habitat and strata. About two-thirds of the species recorded in the savanna were also found in the forest. Within both habitats, a large proportion of the species Found in the least species-rich stratum (vegetation) were also found in the richer one (ground). However, ordination analysis, using data from individual transects, revealed that different habitats and strata can be clearly discriminated from each other in terms of their ant species composition. Each habitat and stratum had I number of characteristic (indicator) species which, although generally riot exclusive to that particular habitat and stratum, predominated there. Our findings indicate that habitat and strata specialization is an important factor governing the organization of ant communities in Amazonia.

AB We evaluated the temporal and spatial patterns of abundance and the amount of damage caused by gall-inducing insects (GII) in deciduous and riparian habitats in a seasonal tropical dry forest in Mexico. Plants occurring in these habitats differ in their phenology and moisture availability. decidious habitats are seasonal and xeric, while riparian habitats are aseasonal and mesic. We Found 37 GII species and each one was associated with a specific plant species. In total, 19 species (51.3%) were present in deciduous habitats, 13 species (35.2%) in riparian habitats, and only 5 species (13.5%) Occurred in both. Abundance and leaf damage by GII were greater in deciduous than in riparian habitats during the wet season. For each GII species that occurred in both habitats, host plant species supported greater abundance and leaf damage by GII in deciduous habitats during the wet season. These results indicate a greater association of GII species with host plants in deciduous than in riparian habitats during the wet season. In riparian habitats, 11 plant species (61.1%) had greater density of GII in the dry than in the wet season. Similarly, leaf damage by GII was significantly greater in the dry than in the wet season in riparian habitats for 12 plant species (66.7%). Dry forest plants of riparian habitats presented two peaks of leaf-flushing: GII colonized leaves produced in the first peak at the beginning of the wet season, and accumulated or recolonized leaves in the second peak it the beginning of the dry season. The levels of leaf damage by GII detected ill this Study in the rainy season were considerably, higher than those obtained for folivorous insects in other neotropical forests, suggesting that this GII guild might have all important impact oil their host plant species in this tropical community.

AB Hong Kong (22 degrees N) is on the northern margins of the Asian tropics and has a native fig flora of 24 species. A total of 3.4 km(2) of the urban area on Hong Kong Island was surveyed for spontaneous and planted fig plants of reproductive size. The 1124 individuals included 14 species in four subgenera: seven native species (F. fistulosa, F. hirta, F. hispida, F. microcarap, F. pumila, F. subpisocarpa, and F. variegata), four of which were sometimes planted, one probably native (F. virens), one naturalizing species (F. religiosa), and five exotic species that occurred only in cultivation, two of which (F. altissima, F. rumphii) are pollinated and produce viable seeds. The native species in the two most common subgenera form distinct ecological guilds: those in subgenus Sycomorus bear large, many seeded, green or yellow figs and are bat-dispersed pioneers on exposed soil; those in subgenus Urostigma bear small, few-seeded, dark-purple figs and are largely bird-dispersed and epilithic. The density of potentially fruiting fig plants in the study area (2.3/ha) was within the range reported for tropical forests and between them they were visited by the entire urban frugivore fauna. This study shows the importance of the urban fig flora to urban wildlife and also highlights the risk of cultivated Ficus species becoming invasive, despite their obligate species-specific pollinator mutualisms.

AB Tubu (Montanoa guatemalensis, Asteraceae) is a popular tree used in windbreaks in the San Luis valley near the Monteverde cloud forests of Costa Rica. Seventy-eight woody taxa from 32 families were found in the understory of 19 tubu windbreaks (five 4-yr-old, eight 12-yr-old, and six 20-yr-old). Mean size of tubu increased with stand age, but tubu was neither replacing itself nor spreading from the windbreaks. Density of other trees and shrubs >= 1 m was higher in 4-yr-old plots than in 20-yr-old plots, but density of other trees < 1 m tall did not vary with windbreak age. Whereas richness of species >= 1 m was higher for 12- and 20-yr-old plots were animal dispersed than in 4-yr-old plots. Tubu windbreaks may undergo major changes in woody species composition, with Daphnopsis americana, Inga punctata, and Trichilia havanensis likely to predominate in the future.

AB We tested the impact of a predatory species of the family Miridae (Hemiptera) on its host plant Piper urostachyum (Piperaceae) by comparing folivory in mirid-excluded plants and controls. We also tested the effect of resident anyphaenid spiders on mirid behavior and levels of folivory. Plants without mirids suffered significantly more folivory than plants with mirids. The impact of spider removal was less clear. Together, these results support the idea that resident mirids serve in anti-herbivore defense for P. urostachyum plants.

AB The mechanisms underlying responses of invertebrates to forest edges remain poorly understood. Here, we use an experimental approach to investigate the predation rates on butterflies in two neotropical forest fragments. Neither distance from forest edge nor degree of forest openness affected predation rates on artificial caterpillars. The mean predation rate of artificial caterpillars on Barro Colorado Island (1500 ha) was significantly higher than that on Peninsula Gigante (2600 ha) likely due to density-dependent effects. Our study demonstrates the utility of artificial predation experiments for rapid assessment of relative lepidoptera predation rates in tropical forests.

The papers in this special section on Neotropical dry forests cover a wide range of sites and problems ranging from the use of multispectral and hyperspectral remote sensing platforms to the impact of hurricanes on tropical dry forest regeneration. Here, we present to the Scientific Community the results of a workshop on which research priorities For tropical dry forests were discussed. This (discussion Focuses on the need to develop linkages between remote sensing, ecological, and social science research. The incorporation of social sciences into ecological research Could contribute dramatically to Our understandings of tropical dry forests by providing important contextual information to ecologists, and by helping to develop an important science-policy-public nexus on which environmental management can succeed.

We also compared leaf area index (LAI) for the Costa Rican sites during the wet and dry seasons. In addition, we examined differences in canopy structure to ascertain the most influential factors oil PAI/LAL Subsequently, we explored relationships between spectral vegetation indices derived from Landsat 7 ETM+ satellite imagery and PAI/LAI to create maps of PAI/LAI for the wet season for the three sites. Specific forest structure characteristics with the greatest influence on PAI/LAI varied among the sites and were linked to climatic differences. The differences in PAI/LAI and canopy openness among the sites were explained by both the past land-Use history and forest management practices. For all sites, the best-fit regression model between the spectral vegetation indices and PAI/LAI was a Lorentzian Cumulative Function. Overall, this Study aimed to further research linkages between PAI/LAI and remotely sensed data while exploring unique challenges posed by this ecosystem.

AB We integrate forest structure and remotely sensed data for four Successional stages (pasture, early, intermediate, and late) of a tropical dry, forest area located in the Sector Santa Rosa of the Guanacaste Conservation Area in northwestern Costa Rica. We used a combination of spectral vegetation indices derived from Landsat 7 ETM+ medium resolution and IKONOS high-resolution imagery. The indices (using the red and near-infrared hands) simple ratio and normalized difference vegetation index separated the Successional stages well. Two other indices using mid-infrared bands did not separate successional stages as well. In a comparison of the successional stages with chronological age, there was no separability in the spectral reflectance among different age classes. Successional stages, in contrast, showed distinct groups with minimal overlap. We also applied a simple validation in another dry forest located in the Palo Verde National Park in the province of Guanacaste, Costa Rica, with reasonably good results.

AB There is a growing emphasis oil developing methods for quantifying,ing the structure and composition of tropical Forests that can be applied over large landscapes, especially for tropical dry forests that are severely fragmented and have a high conservation priority This study investigates the relationships between various measures of forest structure (annual wood), increment, canopy closure, stand density stand basal area) and composition (tree species diversity, tree community composition) measured in semi-deciduous tropical dry forests oil islands in Lago Guri, Venezuela and three spectral indices derived from Landsat ETM+: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Infrared Index (IRI), and Mid-infrared Index (MIRI). Even though there were significant autocorrelations among spectral indices, there were significant differences in the relationships between spectral indices and forest attributes. IRI was not significantly correlated with any of the structural variables while MIRI was correlated with canopy closure and NDVI values were correlated with canopy Closure as well is annual woody increment. NDVI and MIRI were both related to relative tree diversity and all three indices were associated with aspects of tree species composition. Based on the results of this study, it appears that spectral indices, and in particular NDVI, may be useful indicators of forest attributes in tropical dry forest habitats. Further research needs to be undertaken to identify if the results of this study can be applied to other tropical dry forests at a global spatial scale.

AB We compared vegetation Structure and species richness across a 56-Yr chronosequence of six replicated age classes of dry tropical forest oil the island of Providencia, Colombia, in the Southwest Caribbean. Stand age classes were determined using sequential, orthorectified panchromatic aerial photos acquired between 1944 and 1996 and Landsat 7 ETM + satellite imagery from 2000. Along the chronosequence we established 59 plots of 2 x 50 m (0.01 ha) to document changes in species richness, basal area, tree height, stem] density, and sprouting ability. All woody trees and shrubs >2.5 cm diameter at breast height (DBH) were censused and measured. Although woody, species density reached a peak in stands from 32 to 56 yr old, rarefaction analysis showed that species richness increased linearly with stand age and was highest in stands 56 yr old or greater. Nonparametric, abundance-based estimators of species richness also showed positive and linear associations with age. Basal area and mean tree height were positively associated with age since abandonment, while sprouting ability showed a negative relationship. Our results indicate rapid recovery of woody species richness and structural characteristics along this tropical dry, forest chronosequence.

AB Tropical dry forests are located predominantly in the northern portion of Venezuela, above 6 degrees N. Although their potential extent covers ca 400,000 km(2) (44% of the land), they currently occupy about 10 percent of this area. The diversity and complexity of Venezuelan dry forests increases from north to south along a gradient of decreasing severity of the dry season. A typical dry forest in Venezuela presents ca 110-170 species of plants front ca 40 to 50 families with in an area of approximately 10 ha. Species composition and forest structure, however, are dependent oil local landscape conditions (e.g., soil type, topography), and nearby forest types call be very different. Our analysis of five dry forest variants showed a maximum family similarity of 67 percent, although most values fell in the 50-60 percent interval. They are currently considered as one of venezuelas most threatened ecosystems, but only 5 percent of extant dry forests are included in protected areas; this represents 0.5 percent of their potential extent. It is fundamental to promote the creation of at least 3 or 4 more large protected areas (ca 5000 ha), with different climatic and orographic characteristics, in combination with the recovery of threatened species, the restoration of degraded systems, and the implementation of sustainable development projects. Their apparent high resilience suggests Chat with the proper management we call restore and maintain the integrity of Venezuelan dry forests.

AB Using optical and photosynthetic assays from a canopy access crane, we examined the Photosynthetic performance of tropical dry forest canopies during the (it), season in Parque Metropolitano, Panama City, Panama. Photosynthetic gas exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence, and three indices derived from spectra] reflectance (the normalized difference vegetation index, the simple ratio, and the photochemical reflectance index) were used as indicators of structural and physiological components of photosynthetic activity. Considerable interspecific variation was evident in structural and physiological behavior in this forest stand, which included varying degrees of foliage loss, altered leaf orientation, stomatal closure, and phorosystem 11 downregulation. The normalized difference vegetation index and the simple ratio were closely related to canopy structure and absorbed radiation for most species, but failed to capture the widely divergent Photosynthetic behavior among evergreen species exhibiting various degrees of downregulation. The photochemical reflectance index and chlorophyll fluorescence were related indicators of Photosynthetic downregulation, which was not detectable with the normalized difference vegetation index or simple ratio. These results suggest that remote sensing methods that ignore downregulation cannot capture within-stand variability ill actual carbon flux for this diverse forest type. Instead, these findings support a sampling approach that derives Photosynthetic fluxes from a consideration of both canopy light absorption (e.g., normalized difference vegetation index) and photosynthetic light-use efficiency (e.g., photochemical reflectance index). Such sampling should improve our understanding of controls on photosynthetic carbon uptake in diverse tropical forest stands.

AB Highly seasonal rainfall creates a pulse of litterfall in the southern Yucaran peninsula region, with cascading effects oil the timing of essential nutrient fluxes, microbial dynamics, and vegetation growth. I investigated whether forest age or a regional environmental gradient related to rainfall has a greater effect oil patterns of litterfall in this increasingly human-dominated landscape. Litterfall was sampled in 10-13 stands in each of three locations spanning a rainfall gradient of ca 900-1400 mm/yr. Litter was collected monthly from November 1998 through january 2000 in mature forests and in secondary forests aged 2-25 Yr. Despite a substantial precipitation gradient, age was the only, significant predictor of annual litter mass. Two- to five-yr-old forests produced significantly less litter than 12-25-yr-old secondary forests (4.6 vs. 6.2 Mg/ha/yr), but the difference between older secondary forests and mature forests (9 percent) was not significant. Litter production increased with rainfall, bill not significantly so. The pattern of litterfall was similar across locations and age classes, with a peak during late March or early April. However, litterfall seasonality was most pronounced in the old secondary and mature forests. Litterfall was more evenly distributed throughout the year in forests under 10 yr old. Seasonality of litterfall was also less pronounced at the wettest site, with less disparity between peak litterfall and off-peak months. Seasonality was not related to soil texture. Forest age and rainfall are important drivers of litterfall dynamics; however, both litter mass and degree of seasonality depended more strongly on forest age. Thus, the impact of land-use change on litter nutrient cycling is as great, if not greater, than the constraint imposed by the major natural environmental factor affecting tropical dry forests.

AB In 1998, we measured the effects of Hurricane Georges after it passed over long-term research sites in Puerto Rican dry forest. Our primary objectives were to quantify hurricane effects oil forest structure, to compare effects in a large tract of forest versus a series of nearby forest fragments, to evaluate short-term response 10 hurricane disturbance in terms of mortality and sprouting, and to assess the ability of hurricanes to maintain forest structure. We sampled damage from 33 plot's (1.3 ha) across a 3000-ha tract of forest as well as in 19 fragments. For steins with 2.5-cm minimum diameter, 1004 sterns/ha (12.4%) suffered Structural damage, while 69 percent of the undamaged steins were at least 50 percent defoliated. Basal area lost 10 Structural damage equaled 4.0 m(2)/ha (22%) in south-facing native forests. Structural damage and defoliation increased with stern diameter and were more common in certain dry forest species. South-Facing forests and those on ridgetops incurred more damage than north-facing forests or chose comprised primarily of introduced species. Stein mortatity was only 2 percent of all steins after 9 me. Structural damage did not necessarily result in stern mortality Hurricane-induced mortality was not associated with stem height or diameter, but was ten times greater than background mortality. Basal sprouting was proportional to the amount of structural damage incurred in a stand. Forest fragments experienced the same patterns of hurricane effects as the reference forest. The low, dense structure of Caribbean dry forest can be maintained by hurricane damage to larger steins and induction of basal sprouting to generate multistemmed trees.

AB Tropical dry forests occupy more area and are more endangered than rainforests, yet their regeneration ecology has received less study and is consequently poorly understood. We recorded the flowering and fruiting phenology of a tropical dry forest in Jamaica over a period of 26 mo within ten 15 x 15-m plots. Community-wide recruitment reached a maximum in the wet season, whereas no recruitment occurred during the dry season. We observed a unimodal peak in rainfall and fruit production, and the periodicity and intensity of seed production were significantly correlated with rainfall seasonality (the optimal time for germination). Flowering at the community and system levels lagged behind a significant increase and subsequent decrease in rainfall by 7 and 3 mo, respectively, indicating that the dominant factor controlling flowering periodicity is the passage of the major (4-mo long) rainy season and changes in soil moisture conditions. Fruiting lagged behind flowering by 2 mo and a significant increase in fruiting occurred 2 mo prior to a significant increase in rainfall. At the population level, a correspondence analysis identified a major dichotomy in the patterns of flowering and fruiting between species and indicated two broad species groups based oil their time of peak fruiting and the number of times they were in fruit. These were either individuals which were usually in peak fruit 1-2 mo prior to the start of the major rainy season or those that were in fruit more or less continuously throughout the year with no peak fruiting time. This study supports the view that seasonal variation in rainfall and hence soil water availability constitutes both the proximate and the ultimate cause of flowering periodicity in tropical dry forests.

AB Although tropical wet Forests are generally more diverse than dry forests for man), faunal groups, few studies have compared bat diversity among dry forests. I compared ground level phyllostomid bat community structure between two tropical dry forests with different precipitation regimes. Parque National Palo Verde in northwestern Costa Rica represents one of the wettest tropical dry forests (rainfall 1.5 m/yr), whereas the Chamela-Cuixmala Biosphere Reserve Oil the Pacific coast of central Mexico represents one of the driest (750 mm/yr). Mist net sampling was conducted at the two Study sites to compare changes ill ground level phyllostomid bat community structure between regions and seasons. Palo Verde was more diverse than Chamela and phyllostomid species showed low similarity between sites (Classic jaccard = 0.263). The distinct phyllostomid communities observed at these two dry Forest sites demonstrates that variants of tropical dry forest can be sufficiently different in structure and composition to affect phyllostomid communities. At both dry forest sites, abundance of the two most common foraging guilds (frugivores and nectarivores) differed between seasons, with greatest numbers of individuals captured coinciding with highest chiropterophilic resource abundance.

AB Among their effects on forest structure and carbon dynamics, hurricanes frequently create large-scale canopy gaps that promote secondary growth. To measure the accumulation of above ground biomass (AGBM) in a hurricane damaged forest, we established permanent plots 4 mo after the landfall of Hurricane Joan on the Atlantic coast of Nicaragua in October 1988. We quantified AGBM accumulation in these plots by correlating diameter measurements to AGBM values using a published allometric regression equation for tropical wet forests. In the first Measurement year following the storm, ACBM ill huirricane-affected plots was quite variable, ranging from 26 to 153 Mg/ha, with a mean of 78 (+/- 15) Mg/ha. AGBM Was Substantially lower than in two control plots several kilometers outside the hurricane's path (331 +/- 15 Mg/ha). Biomass accumulation was slow (5.36 +/- 0.74 Mg/ha/yr), relative to previous Studies of Forest regeneration following another hurricane (Huge) and agricultural activity We suggest that large-scale, homogenous canopy damage caused by Hurricane Joan impeded the dispersal and establishment of pioneer trees and led to a secondary forest dominated by late successional species that resprouted and survived the disturbance. With the relatively slow rate of biomass accumulation, any tightening in disturbance interval could reduce the maximum capacity of the living biomass to store carbon.

AB Sediment-rich rivers seasonally flood central Amazonian varzea forests, leading to periodic anoxic conditions in the rhizosphere and requiring morphological and structural adaptations, such as aboveground root systems. We investigated some possible relationships between root types and environmental factors in forest plots covering 3.1 ha of varzea in the Maruiraua Sustainable Development Reserve, Brazil. Digital elevation models of the Study sites were obtained; sedimentation and soil texture were investigated to check relationship between position of trees on the flood gradient, soil conditions, and aboveground root systems. Different types of aboveground roots were closely related to flooding duration and habitat dynamics. Species Subjected to higher and more prolonged floods tended to produce more aboveground roots than Species Subjected to lower and shorter inundations. Plank-buttressing species increased with decreasing flood height and/or flood duration, and with increasing growth height and basal area. Habitats inundated for long periods were dominated by species with low growth heights and low basal areas, which formed stilt roots and aerial roots. Root system and sediment deposition showed a close relationship, plank buttressing being more common in sites subjected to lower sediment rates. In the disturbed sites close to the main river channel colonized by pioneer species, the occurrence of buttresses was lower than in less disturbed climax stages. No clear relationship was found between root systems and sediment grain sizes.

AB Most phenological Studies to dare have taken place ill Upland forest above the maximum food level of nearby streams and rivers. In this paper, we examine the phenological patterns of tree assemblages in a large Amazonian forest landscape, including both upland (terra firme) and seasonally flooded (varzea and igapo) forest. The abundance of vegetative and reproductive phenophases was very seasonal in all Forests types. Both types of flooded forest were more deciduous than terra firme, shedding most of their leaves during the inundation period. pulses of new leaves occurred mainly during the dry season in terra firme, whereas those in the two floodplain forests were largely restricted to the end of the inundation period. Flowering was concentrated in the dry season in ail forest types and was strongly correlated with the decrease in rainfall. The two floodplain forests concentrated their fruiting peaks during the inundation period, whereas trees in terra firme tended to bear fruits at the onset of the wet season. The results suggest that the phenological patterns of all forest types are largely predictable and that the regular and prolonged seasonal flood pulse is a major determinant of phenological patterns in varzea and igapo, whereas rainfall and solar irradiance appear to be important in terra firme. The three forest types provide a mosaic of food resources that has important implications for the conservation and maintenance of wide-ranging frugivore Populations in Amazonian forests.

AB Entrained phenology patterns of tropical trees are expected to be sensitive to short-term fluctuations in typical rainfall and temperature. We examined 47 mo of data on the flowering, fruiting, and new leaf phenology for 797 trees from 38 species in the Tai National park, Cote d'Ivoire. We determined the timing of the phenology cycles in relation to seasonal rainfall, temperature, and solar radiation. Regression analysis was used to examine how variations in rainfall and temperature influenced deviations in the peaks and troughs of phenology cycles. We also investigated whether populations that fruit during periods of community-wide fruit scarcity were those populations with relatively long- or short-fruiting duration. Flower, Fruit, and leaf-flushing phenophases all exhibited I 2-mo cycles. The broad peak in flowering began with the northward zenithal passing in April and ended with the southward zenithal passing in September. Fruiting peaks occurred in the long dry season, and leaf flushing peaked in the long dry season but Continued into the wet season. Deviations front phenology cycles were largely attributable to short-term fluctuations in rainfall and/or temperature. Fruiting durations of species were related to the mean diameter at breast height. Species with long- and short-fruiting durations contributed equally to fruit abundance during periods of community-wide fruit scarcity.

We assessed the influence of six microhabitat characteristics oil seed persistence and germination in seeds dispersed in chimpanzee feces and "wadgcs." A total of 257 fecal samples and 56 wadges were located over a 4-mo period by tracking a semi-habituated chimpanzee community on day follows. Forty-nine (19.1%) of the fecal samples contained large seeds from five different tree species. The majority of fecal samples with seeds contained seeds front the mature forest tree Olea capensis (Oleaceae) (83.7%). Forty-two wadges (75%) contained seeds from the mature forest tree Syzygium guineense (Myrtaceae). Seeds were monitored at their deposition site for removal and germination up to 49 d Following deposition. We collected data oil the microhabitat surrounding each fecal and wadge sample. Multivariate analyses indicated that while fecal and wadge samples were nor clustered into particular microhabitats, there was little overlap in the microhabitats in which wadges and fecal samples were deposited. Significantly more seeds persisted over 49 d in wadges (67.9%) than in feces (30.3%). Elevation was the only microhabitat variable determined to have a significant influence oil seed persistence, whereas slope was determined to have a significant influence oil germination.

This study reports changes in composition and abundance of arthropods during the anthesis of inflorescerices and in the developing infructescences of three species of Xanthosoma at three different geographic locations: (1) X undipes in a tropical Cloud forest of Costa Rica, Central America; (2) X. daguense in a tropical cloud forest in the central Andes of Colombia; and (3) X. poeppgii in the Peruvian Amazonas. All Xanthosopia species displayed similar interactions with the main pollinators, dynastine beetles. We observed a succession from terrestrial to aquatic arthropods as inflorescences aged and set fruit. However, community composition varied among different Xanthosoma species. Some arthropods recorded in Xanthosoma phytotelmata have also been reported as inflorescence visitors of the dynastine-pollinated terrestrial genus Dieffenbachia and of vines from Philodendon and Syngonium. Further research may elucidate if phytotelmata similar to those described for Xanthosoma Could occur among dynastine-pollinated genera of Araceae, both in the understory and the canopy of Neotropical forests.

This Substrate differs in many ways from floral nectar, and therefore fruit-feeding butterflies are expected to possess adaptations for efficient Foraging, choice, and ingestion of their food. Differences in food quality and in spatial and temporal Here we describe the sugar and nitrogen content of fruits chat butterflies feed oil in a tropical forest in availability are also likely to have led to life history evolution. Uganda, and measure the attractiveness of these fruits to the local butterfly frauna together With the role chat decay plays in the attraction. These data arc supplemented with Feeding observations at fruit Falls in the forest. Our results show chat (1) fruits contain significant and variable concentrations of sugar and nitrogen, and constituate a nutritious food source for butterflies in tropical forests; (2) fruit-feeding butterflies use cues from the fruits and Fermentation products to locate their food; (3) different classes of fruit-feeding butterflies may vary in their preferences for certain fruits, and differ in their ability to find preferred food; and (4) Fruit Choice is not strongly correlated with attractiveness or nutrient content. The results are discussed in the light of the evolution of food searching and life history strategies.

AB I examined relationships between tongue length of orchid bees (Apidae: Euglossini) and nectar Spur length of their flowers in the genera Calathea, Costus, and Dimerocostus using phylogenctically independent contrasts. Long-tubed flowers have specialized on one or several species of long-tongued euglossine bees, but long-tongued bees have not specialized on long-tubed flowers. Whereas long tongues may have evolved to provide access to a wider variety of nectar resources, long nectar spurs may be a mechanism for flowers to conserve nectar resources while remaining attractive to traplining bee visitors.

AB Two Neotropical ant species, Stenamma expolitum Smith and S. alas new species (described here), exhibit three unusual nesting behaviors: (1) they build architecturally sophisticated nest entrances that elevate the nest opening away from the Surface; (2) they maintain Multiple identical nests but occupy only one of them; and (3) they keep a round "door pebble" at the nest entrance, with which they plug the opening in response to army ants. Adaptive hypotheses for these behaviors are discussed, including the possibility that there are multiple lines of defense against army ant predation.

AB We investigated habitat preference in the community of ungulates in the Calaktmul Forest of Southern Mexico through systematically counting the tracks of six species in randomly placed transects. Tracks were associated with one of Four major forest types according to Pennington and Sarukhan (1998). Forest type availability was estimated through 393 independent points on the same transects. We surveyed 90 transects in three limited areas and one large nonhunted area, with a total of 206 kill walked. A total of 1672 tracks of the six species were Found. Brocket deer (Mazama americana and Mazama pandora) preferred low-dry forest in the nonhunted area and low-flooded forest in the hunted areas. Collared peccary (Pecari tajacu) was a generalist species in the nonhunted area, whereas in the hunted areas, it preferred the subperennial forest. White-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari) was Found only in subperennial forest in the nonhunted area and favored low-flooded forest in tire hunted,areas. White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) preferred low-flooded forest in the hunted areas, while it was a generalist in the nonhunted area. Tapir (Tapirus bairdii) preferred low-flooded forest in the hunted areas. The most evident habitat difference among hunted and nonhunted areas was a major use of low-flooded forest in the hunted areas for the species. Conservation of ungulate species in the Calakmul region requires protection of all major habitat types in burned and nonhunted areas.

AB This stud), documents the stingless bees' (Meliponinae) recent displacement in the Yucatan (Quintana Roo, Mexico) and the effects of human-induced ecosystem disturbance on bee diversity. Point observations of flower-visiting bees were made along transects in three communities with different degrees of human-induced ecosystem disturbance. The community with the greatest anthropogenic disturbance had lower overall species richness of stingless bees and the highest degree of dominance of the Africanized honeybee (Apis mellifera scutellata), while the area with the most intact ecosystem had the highest diversity of stingless bees, though A. mellifera was still the dominant species. We observed aggressive competitive behavior involving physical attacks by A. mellifera against stingless bees, indicating that Africanized honeybees are adopting new behaviors to compete better with dominant native pollinator species.

These robbing visits also likely had an indirect impact on plant or fitness due to the e decreased rate of legitimate visits by the hummingbird Patagona gigas to inflorescences with many robbed flowers. The proportion of flowers within an inflorescence visited by P. gigas was inversely proportional to the ratio of robbed flowers.

AB We surveyed nonbreeding Northern Water thrushes (Seirus noveboracensis) in several coastal habitats in southwestern Puerto Rico, West Indies. Waterthrush abundance was highest (mean = 2.2/point) in well-developed mangrove habitats characterized by large trees and standing water, and lowest (mean 0.1/point) in dry coastal scrub and savannah. Within the latter habitats, waterthrushes were more common in moist microhabitats such as temporary ponds and dry washes. Abundance in most habitats declined between October and January, probably a result of the presence of transients during the October surveys, Between January and March, abundance in mature red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle) forests increased dramatically, suggesting that this habitat provides a refuge for birds at the end of the dry season and prior to northward migration, In conjunction with other data demonstrating the use of coastal red mangroves as nocturnal roosting sites, these results suggest that mangroves are the most important nonbreeding habitat for this species. Conservation of this globally threatened habitat may thus be important for the long-term stability of waterthrush populations.

We found significantly higher levels (> 2.5%) of 4-allylanisole in the monoterpenoid fraction of the oleoresin of trees in stands with high beetle-induced mortality, and a negative association between magnitude of attack and levels of 4-allylanisole in individual trees. Results also suggest that individual trees with low 4-allylanisole levels may escape arrack if they occur in stands characterized by high levels of this compound.

AB Workers of the genus Cheliomymex are unique among the New world army ants (Subfamily Ecitoninae) in that their mandibles are armed with clongate, spine-like teeth. We present the first prey records for this genus. Cheliomyrmex andicola prey on large-bodied ground dwelling invertebrates and, possibly, on vertebrates. Unlike other army ants, C andicola workers Use their sting (hiring prey capture. The workers' unusual mandibles and potent stings may be adapted for piercing and gripping the integument of nonarthropod prey animals, and for rapidly subduing large-bodied prey,, respectively. The genus Cheliomyrmex may be the sister taxon to other Neotropical army ants (Ecitoninae), and Cheliomyrmex shares features of mandibular morphology and prey selection with Old World driver ants in the genus Dorylus. Mass cooperative foraging, an important element of army ant behavior, may have arisen in part as air adaptation for exploiting large-bodied prey.

AB We developed and evaluated a model of the canopy of a tropical montane forest at Monteverde, Costa Rica, to estimate inorganic nitrogen (N) retention byepiphytes from atmospheric deposition. We first estimated net retention of inorganic N by samples of epiphytic bryophytes, epiphyte assemblages, vascular epiphyte foliage, and host tree foliage that we exposed to cloud water and precipitation solutions. Results were then scaled up to the ecosystem level using a multilayered model of the canopy derived from measurements of forest structure and epiphyte mass. The model was driven with hourly meteorological and event-based atmospheric deposition data, and model predictions were evaluated against measurements of throughfall collected at the site. Model predictions were similar to field measurements for both event-based and annual hydrologic and inorganic N fluxes in throughfall. Simulation of individual events indicated that epiphytic bryophytes and epiphyte assemblages retained 33-67 percent of the inorganic N deposited in cloud water and precipitation. On an annual basis, the model predicted that epiphytic components retained 3.4 kg N ha/yr, equivalent to 50 percent of the inorganic N in atmospheric deposition (6.8 kg N ha/yr). Our results indicate that epiphytic bryophytes play a major role in N retention and cycling in this canopy by transforming highly mobile inorganic N (ca. 50% of atmospheric deposition is NO3-) to less mobile (exchangeable NH4+) and recalcitrant forms in biomass and remaining litter and humus.

AB The density and floristic composition of the soil seed bank was assessed in six cloud forest fragments with different levels of human disturbance in central Veracruz, Mexico. A total of 8416 seeds germinated in 60 soil samples, at 5-cm depth, corresponding to 107 species, 85 genera, and 48 families. Significant differences were found among study sites in seed densities with values ranging from 873 to 3632/m(2). Tree species contributed 20 percent of the total soil seed bank in four sites and herbs accounted for the majority of the species in each site. Among tree species, Trema micrantha displayed the highest seed density, accounting for 84 percent of the germinated seeds. In general, the tree species composition of the soil seed bank did not closely reflect the composition of the tree community. Results suggest that disturbance produced by human activities (trail use, selective cutting of trees, livestock) may influence the size and composition of the soil seed bank in forest fragments. Sites where human activity has been reduced showed the highest proportion of dormant seeds.

AB Canopy closure, leaf flush, and ramer recruitment in Bambusa arnhemica, a semelparous, clumping bamboo from the Australian monsoonal tropics, were monitored monthly for 2.5 years at three sites along a flood gradient. Bambusa arnhemica was facultatively deciduous, remaining evergreen at a downslope riparian site but suffering total loss of canopy on a hillside for up to 4 mo during the dry season. Leaf flush was flexible, occurring after as little as 25 turn of rain at the onset of wet season, in response to unusual dry season storms, and apparently also in response to fire independent of rainfall. New culms emerged soon after leaf flush early in the wet season. Culm growth took place during the middle and late wet season, with peak elongation rates of 15-30 cm/day. Some growth continued into the dry season, mostly on branches and leaves of new culms at riparian sites. Not all culms completed elongation before the onset of the dry season, and those that did not were permanently stunted. The demands of culm elongation may limit the occurrence of bamboo in wet-dry climates to areas with predictable and sustained wet season rainfall, but the flexibility of branching and leaf processes facilitates coping with, and permits exploitation of less predictable pre- and postmonsoonal rains. The bamboo growth form and phenological patterns differ markedly from those ofdicotyledonous trees and shrubs.

AB One of the two species from the genus Lophophora is the false peyote Lophophora diffusa, an endemic cactus species of the xerophytic shrubland at Queretaro, Mexico, considered threatened from illegal extraction due to its hallucinogenic and medicinal properties. We analyzed the spatial distribution of L. diffusa and its association with the locally dominant shrub species with the system SADIE (Spatial Analysis by Distance InclicEs). We also Studied the principal microclimatic factors (light, temperature, and humidity) beneath the canopy of the possible nurse plant species. The use of SADIE is a new approach to study the mechanisms of spatial distribution. Lophophora diffusa and the shrub species presented an aggregated distribution with patches and gaps, as indicated by the values of I-a = 4.179 for L. diffusa and I-a = 1.660 for the vegetation. Lophophora diffusa was positively associated with the arboreal vegetation, particularly with Larrea tridentata and Acacia sororia, but was negatively associated with Celtis pallida and Myrtillocactus geometrizans. Microclimate evaluation indicated that C pallida canopy significantly reduced radiation and temperature compared to the other species (L. tridentata, A.sororia y P laevigata). We had expected L. diffusa to exhibit a positive spatial association with C pallida; however, the reduction in light availability apparently limited seedling establishment of L. diffusa.

AB The rattleweed Crotalarta retusa was introduced in Brazil from Africa, and combines a series of characters that have ensured its establishment in NE Brazil. We focused on its reproductive biology and pollinator behavior to explain its reproductive success. We performed manual pollination and germination experiments, and monitored the behavior of C retusa's main pollinators in monospecific plots, and in mixed plots where C retusa occurred together with two congeners, Crotalaria pallida and Crotalaria lanceolata. Crotalaria retusa is self-compatible and capable of automatic selfing. Inbreeding depression was expressed at the level of percent seed germination, but not seed set. Few insects visited the inflorescences. Legitimate pollinators were two large carpenter bees, Xylocopa frontalis and Xylocopa grisescens which, together, accounted for more than 90 percent of the visits. The former foraged on C retusa exclusively and has low pollen spread potential. The latter flew longer distances between plants and visited fewer flowers per inflorescence, potentially increasing the extent of pollen carryover, but at the risk of increasing heterospecific pollen transfer, because it visits other Crotalaria species during the same foraging bout. The different foraging strategies, allied to morphological disadvantages represented by pollen overlap on X grisescens' body, may partially explain the much lower seed germination observed in C pallida and C lanceolata. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that a reduction in flower constancy may significantly depress viable seed set by increasing the chances of self-pollination.

AB The ecology and distribution of thirty-seven Melastomataceae species found on 29 inselbergs in the rain forest of Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, and Cameroon are described. The relative contributions of climatic determinism, and stochastic and historical processes to the present distribution of the species amongst the study sites are investigated. Inselbergs are rock outcrops enduring very harsh edaphic and microclimatic conditions, forming "xeric islands" in the rain forest, where natural grasslands develop. For each Melastomataceae species, the habitats where they were collected on the inselbergs and in other biotopes were listed, and their phyrogeographical distribution was established. Three species are restricted to rock outcrops. Most species are distributed inside the Guineo-Congolian Region. Three species have disjunct distributions on rain forest inselbergs and have their main distribution area outside the forested zone. The distribution of the species amongst the inselbergs is correlated to the altitude and the annual rainfall of the sites, and to inselberg geographical location. This correlation of the species distribution with the geographical location of the inselberg is attributed to the spatial autocorrelation of environmental variables and to the combined effects of the history of pastvegetation changes due to climatic fluctuations and dispersal limitation.

AB Inflorescences of the terrestrial aroid Xanthosoma daguense in the Andes of Colombia are visited by Dinastinae and Nitidulidae beetles. Plants produce one inflorescence at a time, which is pollinated during the first night of opening. Dynastine beetles act as pollinators, whereas Nitidulids lay eggs in the inflorescence and the larvae damage the seeds. We explored the effects of floral offer and distance among inflorescences on the number of pollinator visits, fruit production, and predispersal seed predation. Number of Dynastine visits per inflorescence tended to increase with increasing distances among inflorescences, but fruit predation increased when inflorescences were more clumped. Both pollinator visitation rates and predispersal seed predation were low at high floral offer. Fruit set increased when inflorescences were visited by two or more Dynastines, but the proportion of fruits damaged by Nitidulid larvae was equivalent to the increase in fruit production due to more Dinastine visits. The net result was a similar number of undamaged fruits in all infructescences produced, independent of the number of Dinastine visits. Our results revealed that both pollinators and predators responded to the number of available inflorescences and their spatial distribution, but they had opposing effects on the infructescences. Thus, our study suggests that the interaction of two ecological processes, pollination and predispersal seed predation, may cancel each other's effects under natural conditions.

AB Frequency and efficiency of pollinator visits strongly influence the reproductive success of self-incompatible plants. We investigated the breeding and pollination systems of Hancornia speciosa, a small tree that produces fleshy berries used in the Brazilian fruit industry. Observation and experiments were carried out in Northeastern Brazil. Thirty-three species of the visitor were recorded. Hawkmoths (Sphingidae), bees (Euglossim and Centridini), and butterflies (Nymphalidae and Hesperiidae) with long mouth parts were effective pollinators of H. speciosa. Access to nectar, the only reward for flower visitors, is determined by corolla tube length. Nylon threads of various diameters and dried mouth parts from a number of flower visitors were used in experiments to simulate flower visits. The number of pollen grains removed during such simulated visits showed no significant difference. Although xenogamic, H. speciosa presented a low pollen/ovule ratio (77). This might be related to the high efficiency of its pollination mechanism. Flowers of H. speciosa had 76 ovules on average. Seed set varied from I to 25, indicating that individual flowers received different amounts of outcross-pollen. Fruit production of hand cross-pollinated flowers increased by 90 percent when compared to natural pollination, suggesting pollinator limitation of H, speciosa.

AB We investigated the predispersal survivorship of seeds of six dipterocarp species (Dipterocarpus globosus, D. tempehes, Dryobalanops aromatica, D. lanceolata, Shorea beccariana, and S. pilosa) during 2001-2002, when a general flowering occurred in Lambir Hills National Park, Sarawak, Malaysia. More immature seeds dropped during the first month in Dryobalanops and Shorea spp. than in Dipterocarpus spp. Insects attacked the seeds of all species during all developmental stages through to maturity, although temporal patterns varied among the dipterocarps. In contrast, arboreal vertebrates only occasionally ate seeds, and produced less damage than insects. In four species, insects damaged a significantly higher percentage of seeds than did vertebrates. Direct observations of seed survival patterns and bagging experiments using two sizes of mesh (cloth and wire) in the canopy of Dryobalanops aromatica identified insects as the principal seed predators during both the last phase, and overall. These results document the relative importance of insects as predispersal seed predators in these dipterocarp species.

AB The processing of leaves in temperate streams has been the subject of numerous studies but equivalent tropical ecosystems have received little attention. We investigated leaf breakdown of a tropical tree species (Hura crepitans, Euphorbiaceae), in a tropical stream using leaf bags (0.5 torn mesh) over a period of 24 days. We followed the loss of mass and the changes in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) concentrations and respiration rates associated with the decomposing leaves. The breakdown rate was fast (k = -0.0672/d, k(d) = -0.0031/degree-day), with 81 percent loss of the initial mass within 24 days. This high rate was probably related to the stable and high water temperature (22 degrees C) favoring strong biological activity. Respiration rates increased until day 16 (1.1 mg O-2/h/g AFDM), but maximum ATP concentrations were attained at day 9 (725 nmol ATP/g AFDM) when leaf mass remaining was 52 percent. To determine the relative importance of fungi and bacteria during leaf decomposition, ATP concentrations, and respiration rates were determined in samples treated with antibiotics, after incubation in the stream. The results of the samples treated with the antifungal or the bacterial antibiotic suggest a higher contribution of the fungal community for total microbial biomass and a higher contribution of the bacterial community for microbial respiration rates, especially during the later stages of leaf decomposition. However, these results should be analyzed with caution since both antibacterial and antifungal agents did not totally eliminate microbial activity and biomass.

AB The role of macroinvertebrates in the process of leaf breakdown is well studied in temperate streams, but less is known about their role in the tropics. We investigated the effect of reducing macroinvertebrate access to leaf material on leaf breakdown rates in a forested headwater stream in the Luquillo Experimental Forest, Puerto Rico. We measured leaf mass loss using fine and coarse mesh bags over 12 weeks for two common riparian species: Cecropia scbreberiana (Moraceae) and Dacryodes excelsa (Burseraceae). Coarse mesh allowed freshwater shrimp and other macroinvertebrates to access leaf material, while fine mesh did not. Leaf breakdown rates did notcliffer between C schreberiana and D. excelsa in coarse mesh bags (-0.0375/day vs. -0.0395/day, respectively), but C schreberiana breakdown was significantly slower than D. excelsa in fine mesh bags (-0.0159/day vs. -0.0266/day). Additionally, breakdown in fine mesh bags was significantly slower compared to coarse mesh bags for C schreberiana, but less so for D. excelsa. Breakdown rates for all treatments were fast relative to those in temperate-zone streams indicating that both macroinvertebrates and macroinvertebrate-independent processing can strongly influence leaf decomposition in tropical streams. The difference between C. schreberiana and D. excelsa indicates that the effect of macroinvertebrate exclusion can change with leaf type.

Reproduction was bimodal with birth peaks in April/May and October/November. The first birth peak coincided with a period Of frugivory, whereas the second occurred during a period of almost exclusive nectarivory. All adult females recaptured in consecutive reproductive periods were reproductively active on both occasions, indicating that individual G. commissarisi females regularly reproduce twice per year at the study site. Throughout the annual cycle the mean testis length of the males correlated best with the proportion of females lactating, suggesting a postpartum estrous pattern. Animals became reproductively, active at about I yr of age. Fecal samples showed that females consumed significantly more insects than males.

AB We compared the abundance of foliage-living spiders among seven widespread plant species comprising a gradient of levels of structural complexity in a tropical savannah-like region in southeastern Brazil. Spider abundance among plant species was positively related to the foliage density of their branches. A field experiment using artificial branches was carried out to isolate foliage density effects on spider abundance, thus controlling both biomass and texture effects. Artificial branches were attached to branches of three plant species with similar foliage density, Baccharis dracunculifolia, Diplusodon virgatus, and Microlicia fasciculata. Two treatments were set up: artificial branches with higher foliage density attracted more spiders than those with lower foliage density. The guild structure of hunting spiders was compared among vegetative branches of three plant species with different levels of foliage density: B. dracunculifolia, D. virgatus, and Bidens gardneri. Stalker, and ambusher spiders were more abundant on branches of B. dracunculifolia, which had the highest foliage density. Foliage-runners constituted the dominant guild on D. virgatus and B. gardneri, which have lower foliage density branches. Our results suggest that branch architecture is the most important factor determining the abundance of plant-dwelling spiders in the study area independently of branch biomass, leaf surface area or texture.

AB In young individuals of the obligate myrmecophytic liana Vitex thyrsiflora, several species of ants and other arthropods compete for resources offered by the plant. In mature individuals, the only inhabitant is the ant species Tetraponera tessmanni, which is completely restricted to Vitex lianas as its sole host. Established colonies of this ant provide effective defense against herbivores. The association between V thyrsiflora and T tessmanni is unusual in two respects. First, the climbing life form is rare among myrmecophytes. Secondly, it is surprising that a pseudomyrmecine should be the obligate associate of a liana. Pseudomyrmecine plant-ants often prune vegetation contacting their host plant. This behavior functions in part to protect against invasion of the host by ecologically dominant ants. In contrast, T tessmanni does not prune and is associated with a plant whose success, and thus that of its resident ant colony, depends on contacts with many other plants. Several traits of V thyrsiflora and T tessmanni combine to make the colonization of host plants by potential competitors very difficult. These include behavioral and morphological filters restricting entrance into the plant and exploitation of the resources it can supply; plant anatomical organization that enables T tessmanni workers to carry out all activities, except leaf patrolling, within a single, branched private nesting space within which all food resources offered by the plant are produced; and polygyny, permitting (he colony to monopolize a large, rapidly growing and long-lived territory.

AB The large ateline primates are efficient seed dispersers in Neotropical forests and hunting is driving their populations to extinction, but we do not know whether other frugivores could substitute primates in their ecological role as seed dispersers. In this study we test this possibility using a potential keystone species (Bursera inversa) at Tinigua Park, Colombia. This plant species allows us to compare seed removal rates between emergent, isolated trees, without primate visitors and trees with connected crowns. We used traps to estimate fruit production and seed removal rates in six different trees, and fruiting trees were observed during 2 yr to cluantif, the number of seeds manipulated by different animal species. We carried out seed predation experiments to test if seed removal by predators was affected by distance or density effects. We found that the most productive trees attracted more visiting species and seed removal rates differed among trees, the lowest corresponding to trees without primate access. Seed removal rates from the ground by predators were not higher below parental trees than away from them, but the distribution of saplings in the forest suggests that seed dispersal is advantageous. Although it is likely that the effect of primate extinctions will vary depending on tree species traits, conserving the populations of primate seed dispersers is critical to maintain the ecological processes in this forest.

   HISTORY
AB Fire is a natural ecological force in the cerrado. However, the increasing use of fire by people means that conservation areas are subject to frequent burns. The aim of this study was to assess the potential of fire in an ecological reserve in the Brazilian savannas (cerrado) of central Brazil. Data about vegetation type, topography, climate, and fuel characteristics were input into the fire prediction models BEHAVE and FARSITE to simulate fire behavior during different weather conditions and from different entry points into the conservation area. The results indicated that there is a higher probability of fire entry from particular border regions as a result of the fuel characteristics. The presence of invasive grasses, such as Melinis minutiflora, within parts of the reserve also significantly affected the pattern of fire spread. Wind speed greatly increased the spread and extent of fire. The study showed that significant improvements in modeling fire behavior in savannas still need to be made. This study was the initial stage in the development of a decision support system for fire management in the cerrado.

AB We studied the decomposition of Cyrilla racemiflora logs over a 13-yr period in tropical dry and wet forests in Puerto Rico. The mean mass loss, ratio of soft to hard wood, nutrient concentrations, and the diversity of wood-inhabiting organisms were greater in logs decomposing in the dry forest than in the wet forest. Termites were also more abundant in the logs collected from the tropical dry forest than the tropical wet forest. High moisture content and a low animal diversity on the logs in the wet forest seem to retard wood decay in this habitat. Wood decay rates in the tropical dry forest can be related to the high diversity of species and functional groups of wood-inhabiting organisms.

AB In the coastal zone of central Veracruz, Mexico, we recorded the abundance of orchid plants growing on termite carton traits or directly on the peeling bark of Bursera fagaroides. Although only 19 percent of the surveyed trees contained termite carton trails, trees with termites hosted 92 percent of all orchid individuals. A disproportionate number of orchid seedlings occurred on termite cartons given the relative availability of carton and bark substrate. Our results show for the first time that orchids can establish on termite trails, and we discuss the potential for termite facilitation of orchid populations.

We Studied the reuse of these holes by other organisms after the trogons abandoned them in the tropical dry forest of western Mexico. Of the 24 cavities examined, 19 were occupied (5 by mammals and 14 by arthropods). We found two western Mexico endemic mammals (Marmosa canescens and Xenomys nelsoni) using these spaces. Our results suggest that the T citreolus provides a critical role in creating necessary cavities for many organisms in tropical dry forests.

AB Ants limit bird foraging success via interference or exploitative competition. We compared bird foraging (number and duration of visits, bird species visiting) on ant (Azteca instabilis)-infested and ant-free tropical trees (Inga micheliana and Alchornea latifolia). Ants did not affect the number of bird visits or the number of species visiting. Ant presence shortened visit duration (overall and for insectivores) only on A. latifolia where ant activity was higher. Ants may thus hinder bird foraging on some tropical trees potentially shaping how predators affect arthropod communities; yet ant effects depend on bird foraging guild and ant activity.

AB India has a long and rich history of tropical science. But here, as elsewhere in the tropical world, there are surprises to be discovered. One thinks immediately of the description, in December 2004, of a new species of macaque from India - the Arunachal macaque Macaca munzala. I use the word description deliberately, because this species was long known to the local people, and the species name rightly reflects this knowledge. Mun zala means "deep-forest monkey" in the language of the Dirang Monpa people of Tawang and West Kameng Districts of Arunachal Pradesh, where this species lives. The new macaque was discovered by science during field trips to these areas by Indian scientists from the Nature Conservation Foundation in Mysore, the National Institute of Advanced Studies in Bangalore, the Wildlife Conservation Society in New York, and the International Snow Leopard Trust. In this habitat, the largely Buddhist local community abstains from killing wildlife for food or sport, although the monkey has been reportedly shot for crop raiding. This species, one of the world's highest-living primate species, lives at altitudes between 1,600 and 3,500m, and is thus a veritable yeti.

AB Amphibian populations are in decline throughout Latin America; all families of frogs have experienced declines, but the species associated with aquatic habitats in upland areas have been most affected. Declines in Latin America were most common during the 1980s, but new declines continue to be reported. The causes of declines are varied, but they have most often been associated with habitat loss, a pathogenic fungus, and climate change. Scientists are just beginning to grasp the ethical and biological implications of losses of this magnitude. In this Special Section, we provide a general summary of the phenomenon and introduce five contributed papers that provide new data and new insights into Latin American declines.

AB Population declines have previously been reported for at least 31 amphibian species in Brazil, in the families Leptodactylidae (19), Hylidae (7), Centrolenidae (2), Dendrobatidae (2), and Bufonidae (1). In five Brazilian museum collections, we found no entries of new records dating back to at least 15 yr ago for 13 of these species. We suggest that these taxa be studied in more detail to verify their status and to generate basic ecological data. Museum data indicate that the remaining species have been recently found in areas of reported crashes, or elsewhere. Several apparent declines in Brazil can be associated with habitat loss, interspecific interactions, natural fluctuations, or lack of intensive sampling. Personal observations and field data also indicate possible declines in the states of Parana and Ceara as well as in highlands within the Cerrado biome, in the state of Minas Gerais. Records suggest declines of montane and stream-associated populations of Brazilian amphibians in apparently pristine habitats. Field work is necessary to confirm these cases and to examine whether factors associated with similar extinctions in other parts of the globe-such as pathogens and climate change-are also related to local disappearances. To clarify pending questions and perhaps circumvent new cases, it is important to invest in short- and long-term field studies, and in the maintenance and expansion of museum collections.

AB In the Ecuadorian Andes, populations of 24 anuran species have been reported to be in the process of decline or extinction since the late 1980s. In spite of these reports, quantitative data on population trends on anuran populations in Ecuador are scarce. We compare relative abundance and species composition in surveys conducted between 1967 and 1988 (initial surveys) with surveys conducted between March 2000 and November 2003 (recent surveys) in seven anuran communities in the Andes of Ecuador. A total of 76 anuran species was registered. In 88 populations corresponding to 73 species in seven localities, 56 of them decreased and 27 increased their relative abundances. We observed significant differences in the number of species present in the initial surveys with respect to recent surveys. In six out of seven localities we registered fewer species than previously, even though capture effort was greater in recent surveys. Differences were of higher magnitude for species with aquatic larvae (34 species in initial surveys and 17 in recent surveys). Differences were not significant for species with direct development (genus Eleutherodactylus; 28 species in initial and recent surveys). We registered increases in the upper limit of the altitudinal range for six species and nine new records for six localities.

AB We surveyed the population status of the Neotropical toad genus Atelopus, and document recent catastrophic declines that are more severe than previously reported for any amphibian genus. Of 113 species that have been described or are candidates for description, data indicate that in 42 species, population sizes have been reduced by at least half and only ten species have stable populations. The status of the remaining taxa is unknown. At least 30 species have been missing from all known localities for at least 8 yr and are feared extinct. Most of these species were last seen between 1984 and 1996. All species restricted to elevations of above 1000 m have declined and 75 percent have disappeared, while 58 percent of lowland species have declined and 38 percent have disappeared. Habitat loss was not related to declines once we controlled for the effects of elevation. In fact, 22 species that occur in protected areas have disappeared. The fungal disease Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis has been documented from nine species that have declined, and may explain declines in higher elevation species that occur in undisturbed habitats. Climate change may also play a role, but other potential factors such as environmental contamination, trade, and introduced species are unlikely to have affected more than a handful of species. Widespread declines and extinctions in Atelopus may reflect population changes in other Neotropical amphibians that are more difficult to survey, and the loss of this trophic group may have cascading effects on other species in tropical ecosystems.

AB A generalized decline of amphibian populations is occurring worldwide. The causes for such a decline are not completely understood; however, climate change has been identified as a possible cause for amphibian extinction, among others. Ecological niche modeling has proven to be a useful tool to predict potential distribution of species in the context of climatic changes. In this paper, we used the Genetic Algorithm for Rule-set Prediction (GARP) to model the potential distributions of two species of plethodontid salamanders: Pseudoeurycea cephalica and P leprosa. We projected their potential distributions under climatic scenarios expected in 50 yr based on a conservative scenario of global climate change and assuming a moderate dispersal ability for both species. Our analyses suggest that climate change effects may pose an additional long-term risk to both species of plethodontid salamanders, with a more dramatic scenario in the case of P leprosa. By the year 2050, this species may lose almost 75 percent of its distributional area, and this projection is even worse when deforestation (in the way it is occurring at present) is considered within the predicted model. Our results concur with those obtained for species with limited dispersal capability because they do not track changing climates, but rather face a loss of distributional area. The survival of these species is not secure, even though their potential distributional area falls within a considerable number of natural protected areas.

AB One application of ecological niche modeling is predicting suitable areas for the establishment of invasive species. Herein, I model the fundamental niche of the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, a Pathogen linked to amphibian declines on several continents. Niche models were generated with the Genetic Algorithm of Rule-Set Prediction using point distribution data of the pathogen and digital maps of environmental variables integrated in a GIS environment. The distribution of regions suitable for B. dendrobatidis in the New World is extensive and includes significant portions of. (1) Sierra Madre Occidental pine-oak forest; (2) Sonoran and Sinaloan dry forest; (3) Veracruz moist forest; (4) Central America east from the Isthmus of Tehuantepec; (5) Caribbean Islands; (6) temperate forest in Chile and western Argentina south of latitude 30 degrees S; (7) Andes above 1000 m of attitude in Venezuela, Colombia, and Ecuador; (8) eastern slopes of the Andes in Peru and Bolivia; (9) Brazilian Atlantic forest; (10) Uruguay, Paraguay, and northeastern Argentina; (11) southwestern and Madeira-Tapajos Amazonian tropical rainforests. The regions with the highest suitability for B. dendrobatidis include habitats that contain the world's most diverse amphibian faunas. Models were built with New World localities, but also showed strong predictability for B. dendrobatidis localities in the Old World. Out of a total of 59 reported Old World localities for B. dendrobatidis, 56 occurred within regions with high predicted suitability. I also present analyses of the environmental envelope of B. dendrobatidis and discuss the implications of the results for the conservation of amphibians in the neotropics.

The greatest information from Latin America came from countries such as Costa Rica, Panama, Ecuador, and Puerto Rico. The five papers in this special section illustrate the critical status of Latin American amphibians and further demonstrate certain commonalities of amphibian population declines within the region. These studies provide a framework by which future research and management could proceed in all tropical regions.

   PIONEER TREES
AB Valuable timber tree species frequently show poor regeneration after selective logging in tropical forests. Small size of logging gaps, lack of soil disturbance, and limited seed availability have each been blamed for observed regeneration failures. We investigated seed germination and seedling performance using a split-plot factorial design involving light availability and litter removal for six Central African timber tree species, hypothesizing that canopy gaps and litter removal would improve seedling establishment, and that less shade-tolerant species would show stronger responses to both factors. Contrary to our expectations, significantly more germinants established on intact litter than on exposed mineral soil 3 mo after seeding. After 18 me, seedling survival, height and diameter growth, leaf area, and rooting depth were all much higher in gap plots than in the understory for all species, with the exception of Gilbertiodendron dewevrei, a highly shade-tolerant species whose survival was higher in the understory Leaf production was negatively influenced by litter removal in the least shade-tolerant species, Nauclea diderrichii, with weak or positive effects in other species. G. dewevrei, while displaying a low-light threshold for growth, exhibited a surprisingly high growth response to increasing light comparable to more shade-intolerant species, a response that may help explain its local competitive dominance in the region. Due to the rapid closure of small gaps, we suggest that shade-intolerant species such as N. diderrichii, Khaya anthotheca, and Entandrophragma utile might benefit from more intensive silvicultural practices that create larger canopy gaps.

AB Vascular epiphyte communities, comprising up to 25 percent of tropical forest flora, contribute to plant diversity and thus ecosystem-level processes; however, one of the proximal determinants of those communities, microclimate, is little studied. Here we present the first comprehensive study of microclimates in the inner crowns of two emergent tree species, Hyeronima alchorneoides and Lecythis ampla, at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. We examined photon flux density; temperature, vapor pressure, and humidity in inner-crown branches during the wet and dry seasons and during the wet-season leafless phase of Lecythis. In both seasons, the percentage daily PFD in foliated Lecythis crowns (9%, wet season; 11%, dry season) was significantly higher than in Hyeronima crowns (5%, both seasons), with the leafless wet-season PFD of Lecythis reaching 23 percent of full sun. Temperature and vapor pressure varied less in Hyeronima than in Lecythis crowns during the dry season. Microenvironmental conditions for epiphytes within Hyeronima crowns were more spatially and temporally homogeneous and were more buffered from ambient conditions than within Lecythis crowns. Growing conditions within the crowns of the same trees and among different trees were measurably different and are likely to affect the structure and composition of the resident epiphyte communities.

AB Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi influence the growth, morphology, and fitness of a variety of plant species, but little is known of the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal associations of plant species in forest canopies. Plant species' associations with AM fungi are most often elucidated by examining the roots for fungal structures; however, morphological data may provide a limited resolution on a plant's mycorrhizal status. We combined a traditional staining technique with a molecular marker (the 18S ribosomal gene) to determine whether or not a variety of epiphytic bromeliads form arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal associations. Using these methods we show that the epiphytic bromeliad Vriesea werkleana forms arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal associations with members of the genus Glomus. AM fungal sequences of this plant species formed three distinct clades nested within a larger Glomus clade; two of the clades did not group with any previously sequenced lineage of Glomus. Novel clades may represent novel species. Although Vriesea werkleana is associated with multiple AM fungal species, each individual plant is colonized by a single lineage. The combination of morphological and molecular methods provides a practical approach to the characterization of the mycorrhizal status of epiphytic bromeliads, and perhaps other tropical epiphytes.

AB Induction of plant defenses and their spatial variability are key subjects in the field of ecology and evolution of defensive traits in plants. Nevertheless, induction has been more commonly studied under controlled environments, ignoring other factors that might influence this process in natural settings. The main goal of this study was to determine if artificial defoliation induces trichome production in three natural populations of the tropical shrub Cnidoscolus aconitifolius. First, we performed trichome counts for each population before imposing artificial defoliation to assess differences in trichome loads between populations. Trichome densities (trichomes/cm(2)) were quantified for leaf blades, petioles, and flower sulks. To determine if defoliation induced trichome production, three defoliation treatments (0% leaves defoliated or controls, 50% of total leaves defoliated, and 100% defoliation) were applied once at the beginning of the reproductive season. Trichome counts were performed on each structure every similar to 20 d during a 3-mo period after the application of treatments. Trichome counts showed significant differences in trichome densities between populations for all three structures. In turn, artificial defoliation increased trichome density. Significant differences among treatments were found for trichome densities on leaf blades and petioles. In both these structures, the 100 percent defoliation treatment differed significantly from control plants, presenting higher trichome densities. In addition, the treatment x population interaction was not significant for leaf blades and petioles, indicating that induction is a generalized response in this species, at least at the study sites. These results indicate that trichomes in C. aconitifolius are inducible due to defoliation.

AB We investigated the genetic variation of Avicennia germinans using 172 AFLP (Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism) bands of 45 plants from four localities on the Colombian Pacific coast: 11 from Virudo (Choco), 10 from La Plata (Valle), 12 from Tumaco (Narino), and 12 from Chontal (Narino). AFLP variation among localities (16.2%) was highly significant (AMOVA; P < 0.0001). All the analyses showed that Turnaco was the most genetically distinct locality of the four under study. The other three localities, La Plata, Virudo, and Chontal, apparently form a large single subpopulation with high-to-moderate gene flow among localities. We also found the genetic diversity of A. germinans on the Colombian Pacific coast (H-E = 0.251) higher than that estimated by others over the broad geographic range of A. germinans. All these results together show that mangroves on the Colombian Pacific coast deserve a strong investigative effort to improve our ecological, evolutionary, and biogeographic knowledge of this important tropical forest type.

AB Pelliciera rhizopborae is a Neotropical mangrove species whose distribution is mostly restricted to the Pacific Coast, between the Gulf of Nicoya (Costa Rica) and the Esmeraldas River (Ecuador). In the Caribbean, patches of Pelliciera have been found in Nicaragua, Panama, and Colombia. The genetic variation and the population structure of P rhizophorae were evaluated in six zones of the Colombian Pacific, using AFLP molecular markers. Of the 225 amplified fragments produced, 155 (69%) were polymorphic in 57 individuals of P rhizopborae collected in the localities of Virudo, Charambira, La Plata Island, Tumaco, Milagros, and Chontal. Genetic diversity within populations varied significantly, with the lowest levels of within-population variation (H-ep = 0.081 and 0.090, respectively) in La Plata Island and Tumaco; and the highest level of variation (Hep = 0.187) in Chontal. In the Colombian Pacific, P rhizophorae was significantly structured, with 26.5 percent of the variation found among populations, which was an evidence of substructure within populations. Genetic differentiation was not related to the geographic distance between zones. This suggests that the population dynamics of P rhizophorae could be associated with historic processes influenced by ecological and environmental factors such as the movement of pollen by birds, the displacement of propagules by marine currents, and the spatial distribution of favorable habitats.

AB Although more than 39 primate species have been described as nectar feeders, no studies have documented the negative affect this behavior may have on the reproductive success of the plants they consume. Here we report, for the first time, massive flower destruction of the tropical tree Symphonia globulifera by the frugivorous spider monkey, Ateles geoffroyi, and document the detrimental effect this behavior has on fruit set. Foraging behavior was collected from one troop of A. geoffroyi during 460 contact hours from June 1999 to May 2000 in the tropical humid forest at the Refugio de Vida Silvestre Punta Rio Claro (8 degrees 39'N, 83 degrees 44'E) in the Osa Peninsula in Southwestern Costa Rica. Detailed phenological data were collected from ten S. globulifera trees that the monkeys fed upon and ten trees that were outside of their home range, but in the Refugio. From July to September 1999 S. globulifera was the most important species consumed, representing from 86 to 100 percent of the total feeding time each month. Monkey foraging on S. globulifera flowers was destructive, detaching the flowers completely from the branches in 80 percent of the foraging bouts, and leaving flowers without petals and with damaged reproductive parts in 20 percent of the bouts. None of the ten trees where the monkeys were foraging set fruit, but seven of ten trees outside of their home range set fruit in November and December 1999. These results suggest that some primates may play an important role in floral herbivory in tropical forests and the subsequent reduction in reproductive success. Future studies should focus on evaluating the long-term effect this foraging behavior may have on the population structure of this species and evaluate the effect of primate floral herbivory on the reproductive success of other plant species.

AB We examined the distribution and broad habitat associations of the herpetofauna on three offshore islands of southeast Sulawesi, Indonesia. A total of 74 amphibian and reptile taxa were recorded, comprising 13 frogs, 29 lizards, 29 snakes, 1 freshwater turtle, and 1 crocodile. Of the total taxa, 38 percent were endemic to Sulawesi, 13 were new undescribed taxa. Range extensions were also recorded for one taxon previously not known from Sulawesi. Herpetofauna of these islands is largely derived from that of mainland Sulawesi, and as for Sulawesi generally, is depauperate compared with herpetofaunal assemblages in Borneo, Java, and Thailand. Taxon richness was much higher in minimally disturbed forest and forest habitats with only moderate disturbance levels than in highly modified or disturbed habitats, such as secondary forests, plantations, and villages. Disturbed habitats were characterized by widespread, habitat generalists and human commensals. Forests were characterized by endemic and habitat-specialist taxa. Little discrimination of taxon composition or endemism was found between minimally and moderately disturbed forest habitats. These results reaffirm the need for more general biological survey and research in this region. Taxa most likely to be displaced by human impacts tend to be endemic taxa, for which there exists little or no ecological information. The similarity in the herpetofaunal community structure between habitats with minimal and moderate disturbance levels has important implications for our understanding of ecological resilience in tropical herpetofaunal communities.

AB Dung beetles are important components of most terrestrial ecosystems. In tropical rain forests, dung beetle communities can be very rich in number of species and individuals, and they are known to be useful bioindicators of habitat disturbance. In contrast, very little is known about the organization of dung beetle communities in tropical dry forests. The aim of this study was to describe in detail the dung beetle community of a Mexican tropical dry forest and to assess the relative importance of rainfall seasonality and forest structure in affecting the temporal and spatial dynamics of this community Dung beetles were captured with pitfall traps at the beginning of the rainy season, the middle of the rainy season, and the middle of the dry season, in two distinct forest types: deciduous forest (DF) and semideciduous forest (SDF) at the Estacion de Biologia Chamela. Both rainfall seasonality and forest structure affected the community organization of dung beetles. During both rainy periods, 14 species were captured, but only three during the dry season. Dung beetles captured during the dry season were only found in the SDF. When comparing the beginning and the middle of the rainy season, differences in abundance and guild structure were also observed between both periods and between forest types, but these differences were much less pronounced.

AB Edge effects alter biotic interactions and forest regeneration. We investigated whether edge creation affected the seedling community and its interactions with herbivores and leaf-fungal pathogens. In forest edges and interior sites in Chiapas Mexico, we counted all woody seedlings and species (10-100 cm tall) present in 1-m(2) plots, measured their size (height and leaf number), and examined them for the occurrence of herbivory and pathogen damage. We investigated relationships between levels of damage and size, species richness and density. Species composition and biotic damage varied greatly among sites and habitats (edge vs interior). Late-successional species dominated the community, but richness was lower in interior sites and species similarity was greater among edges than among interiors. Nearly all species (95%) present at edges and interiors showed herbivory damage, whereas 76 percent of the species in edge plots and 68 percent in interior plots showed pathogen damage. Although leaf area damaged by herbivores was similar between habitats (average 9.2%), pathogen damage was three times greater in edge plots (1.85%) than in interior plots (0.57%). Size was positively related to biotic damage at both habitats. Relationships between herbivory and pathogen damage and between pathogen damage and leaf number were significant only for edges. Biotic damage was not related to density or species richness. Overall, plant community structure was similar between habitats, but biotic damage was enhanced at edges. Thus, disease spread at edges may arise as a threat to tropical rain forest vegetation.

AB Insect-fern interactions are not as well characterized as insect-angiosperm interactions. For example, the imitation of unique fern structures by insects has not been observed. On a recent trip to Puerto Rico, we collected ferns that bore small Lepidoptera imitating fern sori. Herbarium specimen searches indicate that these Lepidoptera are restricted to the Caribbean on ferns with highly visible sporangia. A possible selective pressure for the evolution of lepidopteran soral crypsis is wasp parasitism, as evidence of parasitoid wasps was found. However, it is more likely that soral crypsis evolved to avoid visually oriented predators such as birds or lizards.

Agouti densities in a Brazil nut grove were two-fold higher and home ranges were half the size than those outside it. This indicates that the large supply of Brazil nuts results in higher densities and smaller home ranges of agoutis in this seasonally dry Amazonian forest.

Although dung beetles are widely used as a focal taxon in biodiversity studies, nothing appears to be known about the effective sampling area of dung-baited traps. Mark-recapture experiments using Conthon acutus showed that at least 50 m between traps should minimize trap interference, and that wind affects trap detectability. Consequently, we propose a standardized dung beetle sampling design.

ID SITE
AB Allometric equations for the estimation of tree volume and aboveground biomass in a tropical humid forest were developed based on direct measurements of 19 individuals of seven tree species in Northern Costa Pica. The volume and the biomass of the stems represented about two-thirds of the total volume and total aboveground biomass, respectively. The average stem volume varied between 4 and 11 Mg/tree and the average total aboveground biomass ranged from 4 to 10 mg/tree. The mean specific gravity of the sampled trees was 0.62 +/- 0.06 (g/cm(3)). The average biomass expansion factor was 1.6 +/- 0.2. The best-fit equations for stem and total volume were of logarithmic form, with diameter at breast height (R-2 = 0.66 - 0.81) as an independent variable. The best-fit equations for total aboveground biomass that were based on combinations of diameter at breast height, and total and commercial height as independent variables had R-2 values between 0.77 and 0.87. Models recommended for estimating total aboveground biomass are based on diameter at breast height, because the simplicity of these models is advantageous. This variable is easy to measure accurately in the field and is the most common variable recorded in forest inventories. Two widely used models in literature tend to underestimate aboveground biomass in large trees. In contrast, the models developed in this study accurately estimate the total aboveground biomass in these trees.

AB yWoody debris is abundant in hurricane-impacted forests. With a major hurricane affecting South Florida mangroves approximately every 20 yr, carbon storage and nutrient retention may be influenced greatly by woody debris dynamics. In addition, woody debris can influence seedling regeneration in mangrove swamps by trapping propagules and enhancing seedling growth potential. Here, we report on line-intercept wood), debris surveys conducted in mangrove wetlands of South Florida 9-10 yr after the passage of Hurricane Andrew. The total volume of woody debris for all sites combined was estimated at 67 m(3)/ha and varied from 13 to 181 m3/ha depending upon differences in forest height, proximity to the storm, and maximum estimated wind velocities. Large volumes of woody debris were found in the eyewall region of the hurricane, with a volume of 132 m3/ha and a projected woody debris biomass of approximately 36 t/ha. Approximately half of the woody debris biomass averaged across all sites was associated as small twigs and branches (fine woody debris), since coarse woody debris > 7.5 cut felled during Hurricane Andrew was fairly well decomposed. Much of the small debris is likely to be associated with post-hurricane forest dynamics. Hurricanes are responsible for large amounts of damage to mangrove ecosystems, and components of associated downed wood may provide a relative index of disturbance for mangrove forests. Here, we suggest that a fine:coarse woody debris ratio < 0.5 is suggestive of a recent disturbance in mangrove wetlands, although additional research is needed to corroborate such findings.

AB The ability to resist hurricane damage is a property of both individuals and communities, and can have strong effects on the structure and function of many tropical forests. We examined the relative importance of tree size, species, biogeographic origin, local topography, and damage from previous storms in long-term permanent plots in a rehabilitated subtropical moist forest in Puerto Rico following Hurricane Georges in order to better predict patterns of resistance. Severe damage included uprooted trees, snapped stems, or crowns with greater than 50 percent branch loss. Hurricane induced mortality after 21 mo was 5.2 percent/yr, more than seven times higher than background mortality levels during the nonhurricane periods. Species differed greatly in their mortality and damage patterns, but there was no relationship between damage and wood density or biogeographic origin. Rather, damage for a given species was correlated with mean annual increment, with faster growing species experiencing greater damage, suggesting that growth rate may reflect a variety of life history tradeoffs. Size was also predictive of damage, with larger trees suffering more damage. Trees on ridges and in valleys received greater damage than trees on slopes. A strong relationship was noted between previous hurricane damage and present structural damage, which could not solely be explained by the patterns with size and species. We suggest that resistance of trees to hurricane damage is therefore not only correlated with individual and species characteristics but also with past disturbance history, which suggests that in interpreting the effects of hurricanes on forest structure, individual storms cannot be treated as discrete, independent events.

AB Andropogon gayanus (gamba grass) is an introduced pasture grass that threatens Australia's tropical savannas by modifying fire regimes and species composition. To understand the establishment requirements of A. gayanus, we undertook a field experiment to determine the effect of canopy cover and ground layer disturbance on seedling emergence and survival. Seed was sown under three canopy treatments (undisturbed, artificial canopy gap, and natural canopy gap) and under three ground layer treatments (Control, Vegetation disturbed, and Soil disturbed). Results have shown that A. gayanus can establish and survive regardless of canopy cover or ground disturbance, although such site disturbances will increase establishment success. Disturbance of both the overstorey canopy and the ground layer increased A. gayanus emergence, whereas seedling survival to 12 mo after seed sowing was affected by ground layer disturbance alone. Disturbance of the canopy increased light transmission, which may have promoted germination. Ground layer disturbance may also have increased light transmission and suitable sites for establishment, and reduced competition for resources, such as water and nutrients. The ability of A. gayanus to spread along disturbed areas, establish in relatively undisturbed savannas, and resprout after fire within 6 mo after seedling emergence Suggests that this species will become increasingly widespread in Australia's tropical savannas. Its control is urgently required.

AB From January 2000 through December 2002, focal plant censuses were carried out to assess monthly leaf, flower, and ripe fruit presence for 423 individual plants (96 plant species, 39 families) within the littoral forest of Sainte Luce, Madagascar. Fruit-on-trail counts were conducted additionally in 2000 to allow comparison between both phenological methods. Despite low climatic seasonality and the absence of a dry season in the littoral forest, interannual phenological patterns were seasonal. Within year variability was present with clear periods of abundance and scarcity. All phenophases were highly intercorrelated and peaked from November through February. This was found in other humid Malagasy forests as well, while in dry Malagasy forests phenophases were separated in time perhaps due to the more seasonal climate. Temperature and day length seemed to influence all phenophases, the latter showing the strongest effect, while rainfall was only weekly associated with flushing and flowering. Differences in the presence of ripe fruits when comparing between sampling methods can be explained by the differential contribution of several life forms.

AB yMany arborescent palms develop a stilt root cone that provides increased mechanical support on steep hillsides, better root aeration under waterlogged conditions, resprouting after mechanical damage, and rapid stem elongation. However, for most species the role of stilt roots is not well understood. We determined how palm size and slope inclination affected the structure of stilt roots in the heotropical palms Iriartea deltoidea and Socratea exorrhiza. We expected palm height to be lower on steep slopes because the effectiveness of root support could decrease as slope inclination increases, and thus, the structure of the root cone would vary mostly with slope. Alternatively, if stilt root development is determined by palm size, their production should match stem height, with taller palms having larger cones. We measured the stilt root cone of 31 Iriartea and 36 Socratea palms in San Ramon Biological Reserve and Golfito Wildlife Refuge, Costa Rica. We divided the cone into five variables (horizontal projections of the cone base and stilt root height up and down the slope, and width of the cone base), from which we extracted the first two principal components and used them to measure the effects of slope and palm size on stilt root structure. We found stilt roots to be determined by palm size, not by slope conditions. Stilt roots matched palm size, with larger palms having taller and larger cones, maintaining stability under diverse slope conditions.

AB Reproductive phenology, floral biology, degree of self-incompatibility, and floral visitors of Erythrina falcata were studied in an Argentinean population. Flowering occurs during the dry season from late August to late October. Flower lifetime is 5-6 d. Phylogenetic studies indicate that E falcata, together with E. Jusca and E. crista-galli, are included in a basal clade within Erythrina. Its phylogenetic position, floral morphology, and nectar characteristics suggest a hummingbird-passerine mixed pollination system. The flowers are nontubular, and the vexillum (the upper petal of the corolla) covers the other remaining floral parts until displaced by a visiting passerine (Icterus cayanensis) or a hummingbird (Amazilia chionogaster). Both birds act as pollen vectors. Bees were observed as occasional pollinators. Nectar production begins at anther dehiscence and coincides with maximum stigmatic receptivity. The base of the keel forms a secondary nectar reservoir. Controlled pollinations showed that this species is self-incompatible, although a fewfruits develop from selling. Pollen:ovule ratio (43,200:7) is as expected for a xenogamous plant. Only 1 percent of the flowers set seeds under natural conditions. Possible explanations for the low reproductive success are discussed.

AB We characterized the dispersal spectra and phenology of 298 vascular plant species of the sandstone plateaus of Colombian Amazonia. Dispersal modes were determined by the morphology of dispersion units, personal observations on fruit consumption, and an extensive literature review. We obtained the number of species per dispersal mode for the sandstone plateaus and for two recognized vegetation types: open-herbaceous vegetation and low forest-shrub vegetation. Dispersal modes were assigned to 295 plant species. Animals dispersed the highest percentage of species (46.6%), while the percentage of autochorous and anemochorous species was 29.4 and 23 percent, respectively. The dispersal spectrum of the low forest-shrub vegetation type, based on the coverage of every species, showed that percentages of anemochorous (40.2%) and zoochorous species (37.8%) were similar. Autochory was the most important seed dispersal mode of the open-herbaceous vegetation (60%). Birds were the principal group of potential dispersers (58.9%) of zoochorous species and reptiles the least important. We Found two marked fruiting peaks, one from the end of the dry season to the beginning of the wet season and the second one from the beginning to the middle of the dry season. Our results showed that besides the differences in the vegetation structure and floristic composition between the sandstone plateaus and the adjacent tall forest, there also exist differences in the dispersal spectra and the fruiting rhythms.

AB Dispersal quality an important component of seed disperser effectiveness, may strongly affect the rate of plant recruitment. Here we evaluated the quality of Cebus monkey dispersal by comparing the secondary removal fate and germination of fresh and Cebus-ingested seeds of nine tree species on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. Overall, rates of secondary seed removal by vertebrates were low, with most Cebus defecations remaining undisturbed for extended periods on the forest floor. Only four of 30 feces were completely buried by dung beetles, and we found significantly higher vertebrate removal of defecated seeds than control seeds for only one species, Cordia bicolor. Seed germination varied greatly between plant taxa. Seeds of 3 out of 9 species showed significantly higher percent germination after monkey gut passage than control fresh seeds. Germination times tended to be shorter for defecated than for control seeds but were significantly different only for one of nine species, Cecropia insignis. Low rates of seed removal from Cebus feces, coupled with high germination probabilities, suggest high dispersal effectiveness for Cebus and contrasts strongly with patterns of post-dispersal seed fate recorded for other primate species.

AB Studies of zoochorous seed dispersal systems often consider crop size, yet seldom consider the kinds and amounts of fruits surrounding parent plants (the fruit neighborhood) when attempting to explain among-plant variation in fruit removal. We studied avian frugivory at 24 Schefflera morototoni trees from February to May 1998 in central Puerto Rico. The number of fruits removed by avian seed dispersers per visit was similar among focal trees (typically 2-4). In contrast, visitation rate was highly variable (range: 0-71 visits per 4 h). We used multiple regression analyses to evaluate the relative roles of crop size (focal tree ripe fruit abundance) and fruit neighborhood variables (measured within 30 in of focal trees) in affecting visitation to focal trees by avian frugivores. Visitation rate was positively related to crop size (although this variable was only significant in one of four regression models considered) and negatively related to the presence or abundance of conspecific fruits, suggesting that trees competed intraspecifically for dispersers. Relationships between visitation and heterospecific fruits were mixed-some kinds of fruits appeared to enhance visitation to focal trees, while others seemed to reduce visitation. In most regression models, neighborhood variables had larger effects on visitation than focal tree fruit crop size. Our results highlight the important effects of local fruiting environments on the ability of individual plants to attract seed dispersers.

AB In 1998, storms related to Hurricane Isis caused extensive gaps in the cloud forest of El Triunfo Biosphere Reserve in Chiapas, Mexico, where severe storms are infrequent. We examined how this disturbance affected bird species composition. Species richness and composition were similar both between pre- and post-disturbance forest and between newly created gaps and plots that remained forested after the hurricane. However, differences in response guilds were greater between pre- and post-disturbance plots than between forest plots with gaps after disturbance. Granivorous, omnivorous, and terrestrial species were more abundant before the hurricane, whereas insectivorous, midstory, and generalist foragers were more abundant after the hurricane. In addition, species with high sensitivity to disturbance were more abundant in the pre-disturbance forest, while low sensitivity species were more abundant after disturbance. In the post-disturbance forest, insectivorous species were most abundant in gaps and terrestrial-canopyforagers were most abundant in forest plots. Permanently open areas had significantly lower species richness, but had lowland generalist and second-growth species not present in the cloud forest. Results suggest that changes in species composition were not limited to the newly created gaps, but also affected the whole forest. The decline of high sensitivity species after disturbance supports the hypothesis that disturbance negatively affects specialists and benefits generalist species. Although there is evidence that natural communities tend to return to pre-disturbance conditions, changes in community structure could be aggravated if recurrent hurricanes occur before succession takes place.

AB Most studies examining dominance hierarchies have focused at the intraspecific level. While some examples of interspecific hierarchies have been noted, these have usually been limited to a few species in the same taxonomic group that utilize resources in similar ways. Here, we examine evidence for dominance interference competition among vertebrates comprising a diverse frugivore community, including 19 species of birds, squirrels, and primates in a mature Central African rainforest. A total of 38 fruiting trees from 18 species were observed for 2058 h to record dominance interactions between foraging vertebrates. We show that interference competition occurs within and between taxonomically diverse species of vertebrates at fruiting trees. The resulting cross-taxonomic dominance hierarchy includes larger vertebrates, such as primates and hornbills, as well as smaller ones, such as squirrels and parrots. Within this hierarchy, the dominance rank of each species is highly correlated with body mass, and is shown to significantly affect the number of fruits removed from a given tree. Because a majority of tropical tree species depend on vertebrates to disperse their seeds, and particular vertebrates may preferentially disperse the seeds of specific tree species, results may have important conservation implications for the maintenance of tree diversity in regions where populations of larger frugivores have been depressed or extirpated

AB Hurricanes frequently affect the forests of South and Central America; however, few studies have quantified their effects to forest structure, especially when concentrating on the food supply of an animal population. Hurricane Iris made landfall in Southern Belize on 8 October 2001, severely damaging a 52 hectare site where the behavioral ecology of a population of Central American Black Howlers (Alouatta pigra) had been under study for 2.5 yr. The hurricane resulted in a mortality rate of 35 percent for major food trees, which was primarily attributed to uprooting, snapping, and major delimbing. This damage accounted for 97 percent of the food tree loss between the two sample periods. Tree species differences were found in both the percentage loss and category of damage to food trees. Trees of different heights also experienced different percentage loss and levels of damage; subcanopy and emergent trees experienced higher loss than canopy trees, and subcanopy trees were frequently uprooted. This was partially attributed to a lack of buttressing on these subcanopy trees. Buttressing was found to decrease the frequency of uprooting. Tree size was the only factor that did not influence either damage or death. Trees from which fruit were eaten by black howlers died more than twice as often as did trees eaten for leaves.

AB yForest condition and the associated ecological processes vital for forest patch persistence are difficult to judge rapidly and time-consuming to sample. Here we examine the efficacy of epigaeic invertebrate species as ecological indicators of Afromontane forest condition. Epigaeic invertebrates are potentially good ecological indicators because they play an important role in maintaining ecosystem processes, such as nutrient cycling, rely almost entirely upon the resources provided by the organic leaf litter layer, are known to be sensitive to environmental changes, and are easily surveyed. Epigaeic invertebrate communities were sampled using pitfall traps for 21 days in each of 11 forests that spanned a gradient from large and relatively undisturbed to small and highly disturbed forest patches. Using canonical correspondence analysis, we identified a suite of potential ecological indicator species (eight out of 140 species) and showed that gradients in their population response (abundance) reflect overall forest condition, as judged from the correlated vegetation indicators and position of the forests of varying condition along this gradient. The abundance of all but two of the eight indicator species (a spider and the landhopper, Talitriator africana [Amphipoda]) decreased with increasing disturbance. As a group, the rove beetles (Staphylinidae) show promise as ecological indicators and comprised four of the eight potential indicators species. A strong case is also made for a single-species ecological indicator in the form of T. afticana, which is a robust and sensitive indicator of poor forest condition.

AB In the western cordillera of the Cauca valley, Colombia, there is a narrow hybrid zone between two races of Heliconius cydno, one of which is polymorphic. Three large broods show that most of the phenotypic variation observed can be explained by four loci of major effect, named Sb, Yb, L, and K Two further loci, G and Wo, were identified that control more minor phenotypic variation. Sb, Yb, and Wo are linked and the latter is differentially expressed between the sexes. The transition between H. c. cydnides in the north and H. c. weymeri to the south occurs over approximately 15 km. Collections from a single site near the center of the hybrid zone show that gene frequencies have been stable over the 10 yr from 1991 to 2001 and that color-pattern genes are in Hardy Weinberg equilibrium, with little evidence for linkage disequilibrium. This suggests that mating is random between color-pattern forms. Nonetheless, there is evidence for variation in the sex ratio, with parental phenotypes and the most melanic hybrid phenotypes showing a fairly even sex ratio compared to a strong male bias observed in the remaining hybrids. We hypothesize that this might be explained by differential selection between sexes and phenotypes, phenomena that could have important implications for hybrid zone analysis and the evolution of Mollerian mimicry.

AB The spatial distribution and abundance of animals are in part determined by the distribution and abundance of their resource base. In the Central Andes of Colombia, monospecific tree plantations have been used to recover vegetative cover in watershed protection programs, but these plantations differ from natural forests in structure, composition, and resources available to wildlife. To evaluate these plantations as habitat for wildlife, we compared the diversity and abundance of understory birds, flowers, and fruits between juxtaposed 40-yr-old patches of exotic Chinese ash (Fraxinus chinensis) plantations and naturally regenerated forest of the same age. We observed more fruiting species in the regenerated forest, but there were no differences in total flower and fruit availability between habitat types. We also observed differences between habitats in the size of some understory shrubs, but these differences did not lead to differences between habitats in the diversity and abundance of birds. Capture rates of nectarivores correlated with resource abundance at sampling plot scale, but no such correlation was found for frugivores. Understory frugivorous birds are apparently functioning at a larger spatial scale than the patchiness created by the two habitats. Nectarivorous birds are responding to small-scale patchiness in resource availability, but not to the different habitats. These results indicate that at small scales, the ash plantation understory provides adequate habitat for birds.

AB We studied the impact of hunting on monkey species in the Tai National Park and adjacent forests in Cote d'Ivoire. The average wild meat consumption per capita per year was assessed from market surveys and interviews. We determined that the amount of primate wild meat being extracted in the Tai National Park and surrounding forests was 249 t in 1999. Hunting pressure was the highest on the larger primate species such as red colobus, Procolobus badius, and white colobus, Colobus polykomos, and the sooty mangabey, Cercocebus torquatus atys. Estimates of population densities were based on line transect surveys. The maximum annual production of each species was calculated using the Robinson and Redford model (1991) and assuming unhunted conditions. Comparing current harvest levels with the maximum sustainable yield suggests that harvest of red colobus monkeys (Procolobus badius) is sustainable, whereas current off-take of the black and white colobus (Colobus polykomos), the sooty mangabey (Cercocebus atys), diana monkeys (Cercopithecus diana), and Campbell's monkeys (Cercopithecus campbelli) exceeds sustainability by up to three times.

AB Seed removal was assessed for two tree species in three forest types: (1) secondary forest with and (2) without selective vegetation thinning, and (3) mature forest. Selective vegetation thinning meant the removal of all stems <3 cm in diameter of secondary-forest species and was intended as a management technique to accelerate succession toward mature forest. Thinning did not have an effect on seed removal. One of the species showed lower seed removal in mature forest compared to secondary forest.

AB We assessed the capacity of three species of disturbance-sensitive understory birds to traverse a highway (50-75 in width) and large farm clearing (250 m width), by radio-tracking translocated individuals in central Amazonia, Brazil. Most individuals translocated across the highway (eight of nine birds) or moved within continuous forest (five of seven birds) returned to their home ranges, whereas none of five birds moved across the large clearing returned. Our results suggest that large clearings (>250 in width) can significantly reduce the movements of some understory rainforest birds.

ID BIODIVERSITY; FOREST; DIVERSITY
AB Tropical ecosystems support a diversity of species and ecological processes that are unparalleled anywhere else on Earth. Despite their tremendous social and scientific importance, tropical ecosystems are rapidly disappearing. To help tropical ecosystems and the human communities dependent upon them better face the challenges of the 21st century, tropical biologists must provide critical knowledge in three areas: (1) the structure and functioning of tropical ecosystems; (2) the nature and magnitude of anthropogenic effects on tropical ecosystems; and (3) the socio-economic drivers of these anthropogenic effects. To develop effective strategies for conservation, restoration, and sustainable management of tropical ecosystems, scientific perspectives must be integrated with social necessities. Three principles for guiding tropical biological research are suggested: (1) broadening the set of concerns; (2) integration of biological knowledge with the social sciences and traditional knowledge; and (3) linking science to policy and action. Four broad recommendations are proposed for immediate action in tropical biology and conservation that are fundamental to all biological and social disciplines in the tropics: (1) assemble and disseminate information on life's diversity in the tropics; (2) enhance tropical field stations and build a worldwide network to link them with tropical field biologists at their field sites; (3) bring the field of tropical biology to the tropics by strengthening institutions in tropical countries through novel partnerships between tropical and temperate zone institutions and scientists; and (4) create concrete mechanisms to increase interactions between tropical biologists, social scientists, and policy makers.

   LATITUDINAL GRADIENTS; FLORISTIC COMPOSITION; PROMOTES COEXISTENCE
AB Understanding why there are so many kinds of tropical trees requires learning, not only how tree species coexist, but what factors drive tree speciation and what governs a tree clade's diversification rate. Many report that hybrid sterility evolves very slowly between separated tree populations. If so, tree species rarely originate by splitting of large populations. Instead, they begin with few trees. The few studies available suggest that reproductive isolation between plant populations usually results from selection driven by lowered fitness of hybrids: speciation is usually a response to a "niche opportunity." Using Hubbell's neutral theory of forest dynamics as a null hypothesis, we show that if new tree species begin as small populations, species that are now common must have spread more quickly than chance allows. Therefore, most tree species have some setting in which they can increase when rare. Trees face trade-offs in suitability for different microhabitats, different-sized clearings, different soils and climates, and resistance to different pests. These trade-offs underlie the mechanisms maintaining alpha-diversity and species turnover. Disturbance and microhabitat specialization appear insufficient to maintain alpha-diversiry of tropical trees, although they may maintain tree diversity north of Mexico or in northern Europe. Many studies show that where trees grow readily, tree diversity is higher and temperature and rainfall are less seasonal. The few data available suggest that pest pressure is higher, maintaining higher tree diversity, where winter is absent. Tree a-diversiry is also higher in regions with more tree species, which tend to be larger, free for a longer time from major shifts of climate, or in the tropics, where there are more opportunities for local coexistence.

AB In many forest ecosystems, green leaf deposition (greenfall) constitutes an enrichment over background levels of litterfall nutrients and may therefore influence key ecosystem processes. This study examined the litter quality and decomposition rates of green leaves compared to senescent litterfall for four dominant tree species (Dacryodes excelsa, Manilkara bidentata, Guarea guidonia, and Cecropia schreberiana) in a lower montane rain forest at El Verde Field Station, Luquillo Experimental Forest, Puerto Rico. Green leaves from the canopy and freshly senesced leaves from the forest floor were analyzed for carbon, nitrogen, and fiber and placed in litterbags in the field for up to 16 weeks. Green leaves displayed significantly higher rates of decomposition than did senescent litter among all four species. Green leaves also had significantly higher nitrogen concentrations and lower lignin to nitrogen ratios compared to senescent leaves. These results suggest that greenfall may have a major influence on decay processes and nutrient cycling in forests that experience large-scale green foliage removal.

AB We tested the hypothesis that growth and survival of aerial roots impose a limit on the height at which a primary hemiepiphyte can become successfully established within tree crowns and evaluate the implications for the vertical distribution of hemiepiphytes in the forest canopy. Density and spatial distribution, and growth and survival of aerial roots were studied in two common species of hemiepiphytic Araceae, Philodendron radiatum and Anthurium clavigerum, in a lowland tropical moist forest in Panama between March and October 2001. Additionally, root growth and survival were studied both in normal, unmanipulated, and experimentally cut roots to investigate the effect of damage on root resprouting and survival. Survival analysis revealed much greater survival of aerial roots of A. clavigerum than P radiatum. In contrast, growth rates in the latter were on average about three times higher when compared to A. clavigerum. In both species, experimental cutting of the root invariably led initially to the development of dieback symptoms; however, plants responded to root damage by producing resprouts. A risk model for the two species suggests that only the fastest-growing roots of P radiatum are likely to survive long enough to reach the soil from a host branch 6.8 m high, which equals the mean height of occurrence observed for the epiphytic stage of this species at our study site. In contrast, slow-growing appressed aerial roots of A. clavigerum may never be able to establish a connection with the soil from similar heights in the canopy before roots die. Consistent with our hypothesis, A. clavigerum is found much lower in the forest (it rarely exceeds ca 5 m).

AB We conducted a demographic examination of Prerocercus gaumeri, a rare and endemic columnar cactus of the Yucatan peninsula, Mexico. Growth, survival, and fecundity of individuals were recorded in two populations from 1997 to 1999. Size-based population projection matrices were constructed to document the population dynamics. Seed germination and seedling establishment experiments were conducted in the field to estimate the rate of seed and seedling survival. Our results show that P gaumeri did not reproduce by asexual means or vegetative growth and thus relies wholly on sexual reproduction for population growth. Low reproductive success, seed predation, and low seedling survival appear to be important factors that contribute to the rarity of this species. The population growth rate (X) varied between 0.9545 and 1.0316. According to the matrix elasticity values, population dynamics of this species depend mainly on adult survival, with low values in fecundity and survival for the lowest size categories. Our results did not indicate that the population size of P gaumeri was decreasing; however, increasing pressure on land use transformation is one of the most important factors that may threaten the persistence of this species.

AB Sixteen percent of tree stems 10 cm diameter or greater recorded in seven 1 ha plots in Rabongo Forest, Uganda had stem damage attributable to elephants (Loxodonta africana). We propose four strategies that may help tree species persist under these conditions: repellence, resistance, tolerance and avoidance. We sought and found evidence for each strategy. Large, shade-tolerant Cynometra alexandri dominated basal area (often >50%) and showed severe scarring. Nearly 80 percent of stems were small pioneer species. Scarring frequency and intensity increased with stem size. Stem-size distributions declined steeply, implying a high mortality to growth rate ratio. Tree species with spiny stems or with known toxic bark defenses were unscarred. Epiphytic figs escaped damage while at small sizes. Mid-successional tree species were scarce and appeared sensitive to elephants. Savanna species were seldom scarred. Taking stem size-effects into account by using a per-stem logistic modeling approach, scarring became more probable with slower growth and with increasing species abundance, and also varied with location. Pioneer and shade-bearer guilds showed a deficit of intermediate-sized stems. Evidence that selective elephant damage is responsible for monodominant C. alexandri forests remains equivocal; however, elephants do influence tree diversity, forest structure, and the wider landscape.

AB The aims of this study were to investigate the diet and relative abundance of fruit bats in a lowland Malaysian rain forest and to test the hypothesis that the local assemblage structure of fruit bats varies significantly over time in relation to the availability of food. In total, 352 fruit bats of eight species were captured during 72,306 m(2) mist-net hours of sampling between February 1996 and September 1999. Three species of fruit bats (Balionycteris maculata, Chironax melanocephalus, and Cynopterus brachyotis) that fed on a wide range of "steady state" and "big bang" food resources were captured continuously throughout the study period, with no significant variation in capture rates over time. In contrast, five species that fed exclusively or almost exclusively on "big bang" food resources were sampled intermittently, with significant temporal variation in the capture rates of two species (Cynopterus horsfieldi and Megaerops ecaudatus). Significant variation in the capture rates of the remaining three species (Dyacopterus spadiceus, Eonycteris spelaca, and Rousettus amplexicaudatus) could not be detected due to small sample sizes. Since ephemeral "big bang" food resources were only sporadically available within the study area and were associated with large canopy trees and strangler figs, these results suggest that food abundance, or the availability of specific food items, may be important factors limiting local fruit bat species diversity in old-growth Paleotropical rain forest. Thus, only three fruit bat species were locally resident within the forest throughout the study period. Therefore, further studies on the ranging behavior and habitat requirements of Malaysian fruit bats are required to assess the adequacy of existing reserves and protected areas.

AB We observed ten species of psittacids, three species of columbids, and two species of cracids consuming soil from banks of the lower Tambopata River in southeastern Peru. Our study used observations and soil analyses from eight exposed riverbank sections to test the predictions of three models to determine why birds consume clay: mechanical aid to digestion (grit), adsorption of dietary toxins, and mineral supplementation. We found that preferred soils were deficient in particles large enough to aid in the mechanical breakdown of food and help digestion. Percent clay content and cation exchange capacity (CEC), both predicted to correlate with adsorption of toxins, did not differ between used and unused sites as had been found in a similar study. Instead, preferred soils were more saline and had higher concentrations of exchangeable sodium. This suggests that the choice of soils at our site was based primarily on sodium content. Birds may be using the heavy, plastic texture of soils rich in clays and high in exchangeable sodium as a proximal cue for soil selection. Our findings suggest that avian soil selection decisions depend on the range of available soil characteristics.

AB We studied seasonal variation in bird assemblages in a Chaco subtropical semiarid forest, Santiago del Estero Province, Argentina. We carried out seven samplings during both breeding and non breeding periods, in order to assess the resident status and the trophic guild of each species. During the last four samplings we recorded bird populations using 30 fixed-radius points, in order to estimate bird density species density evenness, and species diversity. We found that: (1) the bird assemblage had 96 species (67 residents, 19 summer migrants, I winter migrant, 5 of doubtful residency and 4 species whose resident status was unknown); (2) higher values of species density, evenness and species diversity were found during breeding periods; and (3) higher community attributes were followed by higher densities of 4 trophic guilds: nectarivores, frugivores and short and long-flight insectivores during the breeding periods. Changes in guild densities were probably associated with the arrival of summer migrants and to seasonal fluctuations in food resources, which in turn promoted seasonal changes in species density and diversity. Different from observations in other avian assemblages of the Chaco, no temporal variations were observed in the terrestrial seedeaters guild. This could be due to the fact that our study site forests are located in a landscape matrix with agricultural fields and grasslands that may offer year-round seed supply. The Chaco subtropical semiarid forest seems to be an important breeding habitat for many migrant species from both Neotropical and Nearctic regions.

AB Spatial ecology of Puerto Rican boas (Epicrates inornatus, Boidae) was studied with radiotelemetry in a subtropical wet forest recovering from a major hurricane (7-9 yr previous) when Hurricane Georges struck. Different boas were studied during three periods relative to Hurricane Georges: before only; before and after; and after only. Mean daily movement per month increased throughout the three periods, indicating that the boas moved more after the storm than before. Radio-tagged boas also became more visible to observers after the hurricane. Throughout the three periods, the sexes differed in movements, with males moving greater distances per move and moving more frequently than females. Males showed a bimodal peak of movement during April and June in contrast to the females' July peak. Sexes did not differ in annual home range size, which had a median value of 8.5 ha (range = 2.0-105.5 ha, N = 18) for 95 percent adaptive kernal. Females spent more time on or below ground than did males, which were mostly arboreal. Trees used by boas had larger diameters and more vines than random trees. Hurricane winds that strip leaves, vines, and branches from trees may reduce cover for boas and limit access to arboreal sites, at least for several years until succession brings about recovery with increased vine growth. Boas were especially difficult to observe; telemetrically monitored boas were detected visually at an average of only 15 percent of their fix sites, indicating that the species is more abundant than generally perceived.

AB Hypoxia (oxygen scarcity) is widespread in tropical freshwaters, particularly in dense swamps, and may be an important factor structuring benthic macroinvertebrate communities. Macroinvertebrates show a diversity of respiratory modes ranging from atmospheric breathing to tracheal gill breathing, and these adaptations affect their ability to use hypoxic water. The objectives of this study were to (a) describe the benthic macroinvertebrate community from ten swamp and river sites in Kibale National Park, Uganda, (b) determine the degree to which dissolved oxygen explains variation in abundance of respiratory groups (taxa with a similar respiratory mode) among sites, and (c) test for significant seasonal variation in the abundance of the numerically dominant respiratory groups. Macroinvertebrates from monthly collections over a two-year period were identified to the lowest taxonomic level necessary to place them in functional respiratory groups. Across all sites, both the relative and absolute abundance of atmospheric breathers (e.g., pulmonate snails and nepids) and mantle/ctenidia breathers (primarily fingernail clams) were negatively correlated with dissolved oxygen, while the abundance of tracheal gill breathers (e.g., anisopterans and zygopterans) was positively correlated with dissolved oxygen. We did not detect significant seasonal trends in catch per unit effort of numerically dominant respiratory groups. Dissolved oxygen concentration was a good predictor of the abundance of some respiratory groups and may be a key factor in maintaining the structure and diversity of these assemblages.

AB Insect defenses against avian predators often include both a primary defense that reduces the probability of being attacked and a secondary defense, typically escape behavior, employed if the primary defense fails. Escape behavior, however, can make insects potentially vulnerable to specialized flush-pursuit predators. Neotropical Redstarts of the genus Myioborus (Parulidae) exploit insect escape behavior by using their contrasting black-and-white plumage and animated foraging behavior to startle insect prey that are then pursued and captured in flight. We examined how insect primary defense strategy and natural variation in Myioborus plumage pattern influence escape behavior in six species of homopterans from Monteverde, Costa Rica. The six homopterans included two aposematic species of the family Cercopidae (Ocoaxo sp. and Sphenorhina sp.), two cryptic species of the family Cixiidae (both Bothriocera spp.), and two structurally defended species of the family Membracidae (Campylocentrus sp. and Vestistilus variabilis). We measured the distance at which models of Myioborus Redstarts elicited escape behavior in insects under field conditions. Response distances varied significantly with both homopteran primary defense and Myioborus plumage pattern. Strucrurally defended homopterans were the most sensitive to the models and cryptic homopterans were the least sensitive. The model simulating the plumage of endemic M. miniatus comptus of Costa Rica elicited greater responses than did models of other Myioborus taxa with either less or more white in the plumage. Our results suggest that (1) primary defense strategies can have a significant effect on insect vulnerability to flush-pursuit predators, and (2) geographic variation in the plumage pattern of Myioborus Redstarts may reflect adaptation to regional prey and habitat characteristics that maximizes flush-pursuit foraging performance.

AB The jumping spiders Enstiromastix nativo, Psecas sumptuosus, and Uspachus sp. n. (Salticidae) live on terrestrial bromeliads in areas with different phytophysiognomies in southeastern and northeastern Brazil. To understand these spider-plant interactions, we investigated if (1) these spiders were associated specifically with bromeliads, (2) the spiders utilized particular bromeliad species, and (3) plant size and density of bromeliads affected spider distribution. The jumping spiders were not found outside bromeliads, indicating a strict spider-plant association. Eustiromastix and Uspachus occupied bromeliads in open areas, whereas Psecas was found on forest bromeliads. Eustiromastix occurred at a higher frequency on larger bromeliads and in patches with higher bromeliad density This is one of the few studies to demonstrate specific relationships between jumping spiders and a particular plant type.

AB We studied avian foraging at two shaded coffee plantations in Ciales, Puerto Rico. Both coffee plantations contained patches of second-growth forest but differed in shade types; one was a rustic plantation with a species-diverse shade including many fruiting plant species and the other was a commercial polyculture shaded almost solely by Inga vera. We quantified foraging activity of five fruit-eating bird species (Euphonia musica, Loxigilla portoricensis, Nesospingus speculiferus, Spindalis portoricensis, and Vireo altiloquous) and monthly fruit abundance in the coffee plantation and adjacent second-growth forest habitats at each site. Fruits comprised more than 50 percent of the diets for four of five focal bird species. We found a significant difference in the number of foraging records for focal bird species between coffee and forest habitats in the commercial polyculture but found few differences between these habitats in the rustic coffee farm. Overall, foraging activity was positively correlated with the abundance of fruits across study sites. Bird foraging was concentrated on plant species in the genera Cecropia, Miconia, Schefflera, Phoradendron, and Guarea, which together accounted for over 50 percent of frugivory records. Plant species in such genera fruited over prolonged time periods and provided birds with a fairly constant fruit supply. Our findings underscore the importance of fruiting plant species in making coffee plantations suitable habitat for birds and suggest that native fruiting plants be incorporated in coffee farms for avian conservation.

AB We studied temporal and spatial dynamics of extremely diverse moth ensembles (Lepidoptera: Pyraloidea) along a gradient of forest disturbance ranging from undisturbed primary tropical rain forest to different kinds of modified forest and open cultivated land at the margin of Mount Kinabalu National Park (Sabah, East Malaysia). We sampled moths by light trapping during two periods (March-May and August-September 1997). We collected a total of 7724 individuals representing 680 species during 78 light-trapping nights at six study sites. Species diversity (Fisher's alpha.) of ensembles in undisturbed primary forest was distinctly higher than in disturbed or secondary forest. More pyraloid moths were attracted in undisturbed primary forest. Samples from disturbed primary or old-growth secondary forest were statistically indistinguishable from the undisturbed primary forest ensemble in regard to species composition. Thus, pyraloid ensembles from disturbed forest with tall trees remaining appeared to represent impoverished subsets of the undisturbed primary forest community. The more heavily disturbed sites had a distinct fauna and showed a stronger faunal differentiation among each other. Four species of the genus Eoophyla, in which aquatic larvae feed on algae in fast-running streams benefited prominently from forest disturbance. Temporal variation of ensembles was remarkably concordant across the disturbance gradient. Relative abundance variation of the commonest species was identical at all sites. Overall, pyraloid moths responded more sensitively to anthropogenic habitat alteration than most other moth taxa studied thus far in tropical regions and allowed for an analysis of diversity patterns at a high temporal resolution.

AB Tropical ecosystems support a diversity of species and ecological processes that are unparalleled anywhere else on Earth. Despite their tremendous social and scientific importance, tropical ecosystems are rapidly disappearing. To usher tropical ecosystems and the human communities dependent upon them through the environmental transformations of the 21st century, tropical biologists must provide critical knowledge in three areas: 1) the structure and function of tropical ecosystems; 2) the nature and magnitude of anthropogenic effects on tropical ecosystems; and 3) the socioeconomic drivers of these anthropogenic effects. To develop effective strategies for conservation, restoration, and sustainable management of tropical ecosystems, scientific perspectives must be integrated with social necessities. A new set of principles built on a framework for pursuing relevant tropical biological research will facilitate interdisciplinary approaches, integrate biological knowledge with the social sciences, and link science with policy. We propose four broad recommendations for immediate action in tropical biology and conservation that are fundamental to all biological and social disciplines in the tropics: 1) assemble and disseminate information on life's diversity in the tropics; 2) enhance tropical field stations and build a worldwide network to link them with tropical field biologists at their field sites; 3) bring the field of tropical biology to the tropics by strengthening institutions in tropical countries through novel partnerships between tropical and temperate zone institutions and scientists; and 4) create concrete mechanisms to increase interactions between tropical biologists, social scientists, and policy makers.

AB Litter quality parameters such as nitrogen and lignin content correlate with decomposition rates at coarse scales, but finescale mechanisms driving litter decomposition have proven more difficult to generalize. One potentially important driver of decomposition is the activity of extracellular enzymes that catalyze the degradation of complex Compounds present in litter. To address the importance of this mechanism, we collected 15 Hawaiian plant litter types and decomposed them in fertilized and control plots for up to two years. We measured litter nutrient content and carbon chemistry prior to decomposition, as well as extracellular enzyme activities, mass loss, and litter nutrient content over time. We found that water-soluble carbon content, cellobiohydrolase activities, and polyphenol oxidase activities were significantly correlated with mass loss. Enzyme activities and decomposition rate constants both varied significantly by litter type, and fertilization increased mass loss rates in five litter types. Some litter types that decayed faster under fertilization also showed time-dependent increases in carbon-degrading enzyme activities, but others decayed faster independent of enzyme changes. These results suggest that extracellular enzyme activities partially determine litter decomposition rates, but high soluble carbon content may circumvent the requirement for enzyme-catalyzed decomposition.

AB Interest in tropical secondary forests has grown as large areas of agriculture have been abandoned in recent decades; yet, there are few long-term studies of post-agriculture vegetation recovery in the tropics. In this study, we compared the vegetation structure and floristic composition of old-growth and 40-year-old secondary riparian forests in the Cordillera Central, Dominican Republic. Canopy height and stein density of woody plants were similar between forest types, but basal area of trees was 27 percent lower in secondary forests. Introduced tree species comprised 20 percent of the basal area and dominated the understory of secondary Forests. Life-form diversity was higher in old-growth forests as arborescent Ferns, the palm species, and epiphytic bromeliads, orchids, and bryophytes were much more abundant. The number of species of epiphytic orchids and bromeliads, ground ferns, and herbaceous plants was also significantly higher in old-growth forests. The species density of woody plants and vines, however, was comparable between forest types, and vine abundance was significantly higher in secondary forests. The high importance of introduced tree species and the delayed recovery, of several plant life-forms have important implications for the conservation of plant diversity in secondary forests in the tropics. The robust regeneration of woody structure despite the long land tenure (ca 60 yr) by farmers is probably doe to the nutrient-rich alluvial soils and low-intensity agriculture. This Study revealed the potential for the rapid recovery of woody plant diversity and Structure in fertile secondary forests adjacent to mature forest seed Sources and the more delayed recovery of nonwoody plant diversity and abundance.

AB We measured changes in insect herbivore intensity and guild structure in two tropical forests of Costa Rica over a three-year period. We estimated herbivory levels using discrete leaf litter samples to account for factors that influence the types of leaves most likely to be preserved in the fossil record. We found that leaf area removed by insect herbivores did not vary significantly between years within the two sampled forests, but differed across years between forests. The lack of variation in herbivore intensity within forests suggests that estimates of herbivore damage from fossil assemblages may reflect levels of herbivore intensity typically experienced by a given forest, at least over a short ecological timescale. The differences in herbivore intensity between similarly categorized forests suggest that simple one-to-one comparisons between fossil and modern sites can be problematic. The distribution of functional feeding groups also differed on an interannual basis both within and between forests. As guild structure can be highly variable, caution should be taken when comparing modern herbivore guild structures with those from fossil assemblages. Studies of herbivory in fossil assemblages have yielded much lower levels of damage than those found in this study as well as those measured from other modern forests. Leaf fossil preservation, environmental differences, and changes in plant-insect associations through time may account for these differences.

AB From an ecological standpoint, the symbiosis between leaf-cutting ants and their fungus can be described as an herbivore feeding on plant material harvested by the ants, metabolized by the fungus, and finally removed by the ants as refuse. Here, we report on a nutrient balance (soluble and insoluble carbon and nitrogen compounds) between harvested and refuse material collected from six Acromyrmex lundi nests from a semiarid woodland in Cordoba, Argentina. The nutrient balance was calculated using cellulose as an indicator. Harvested material had low protein (10%) and high fiber content (57%). Refuse material was rich in fiber (53%), total nitrogen (2%), and ash content (28%). Balance was negative for soluble carbon and phenols. Soluble fibers, lignin, and true protein remained unchanged. Surprisingly, crude protein and all soluble nitrogen fractions had a positive balance, suggesting additional nitrogen sources besides plant material. Phenol utilization by the leaf-cutting ant fungus suggests that phenols are not harmful to the fungus. Inability to metabolize insoluble carbon compounds and a net nitrogen gain in the refuse material were peculiar and interesting features of the ant-fungus system.

AB We examined feeding by the mangrove tree crab Aratus pisonii in Tampa Bay, Florida, in relation to the percent dry weight of carbohydrate, protein, phenolics, condensed tannins, ash, carbon, nitrogen, carbon:nitrogen ratio, water content, and sclerophylly for leaves of the red mangrove Rhizophora mangle. Comparisons of leaf chemistry were made among leaves that experienced variable levels of crab damage. Because R. mangle is the crab's preferred food source based on damage patterns in the field, comparisons of R. mangle leaf chemistry were made in relation to that of the black mangrove Avicennia germinans and the white mangrove Laguncularia racemosa. We observed a negative relationship between level of leaf damage and percent dry weight of nitrogen, carbohydrates, condensed tannins, and sclerophvlly. In contrast, a positive relationship was found between leaf damage and the carbon:nitrogen ratio. The chemical constituents that provided the best explanation for differences in damage among the three mangrove species include condensed tannins, nitrogen, carbon: nitrogen ratio, carbohydrates, phenolics, water content, and ash. The results from this study suggest that chemistry only partially explains food preference by A. pisonii. It appears that A. pisonii feeding behavior and preference may be influenced by a more complex series of factors and interactions, which may include reproduction by, predation on, and interspecific competition with A. pisonii.

AB Ants of the genus Oecophylla are predators of other insects and are able to protect a variety of terrestrial plants against pest insects; however, observations on the ecology of these ants in mangrove forests are lacking. General observations on the ecology of Oecophylla smaragdina were carried out in a Thai mangrove forest to determine if these ants can protect their host plants in less favorable mangrove habitats. Leaf herbivory and the density of O. smaragdina ants were measured on Rhizophora mucronata trees at two sites. The results showed a negative correlation between ant density and herbivory. At both sites, the mean percent damaged leaf area was more than four times higher on trees without ants compared to "ant-trees." A significant negative correlation was found between tree mean percent leaf damage and the density of ants on the tree. Furthermore, on trees with ants, there was less herbivory on leaves close to ant nests compared to other leaves on the tree. Most damage was caused by chrysomelid beetles (62%) and sesarmid crabs (25%) and both types of herbivory were significantly reduced on ant-trees.

AB The Neotropical beetle Cephaloleia fenestrata is a specialist herbivore on Pleiostachya pruinosa (Marantaceae) in upland and flood zone habitat of lowland tropical wet forest in Costa Rica. Cephaloleia fenestrata spends its entire life cycle on P pruinosa, feeding primarily in rolled young leaves as adults, feeding in the concavity of leaf petioles as larvae, and laying eggs and pupating on the leaf petioles. Egg development time is about average for Chrysomelidae, approximately ten days. Cephaloleia fenestrata larvae, like other rolled leaf hispines, have an extremely long development period (94 d) consisting of only two instars (compared to a range of three to six in other Chrysomelidae). The 30-day pupal stage is also long, but within the range of that observed in other Chrysomelidae. Adults live an average of six weeks. The generation time for C fenestrata is thus approximately six months. Male C fenestrata lived longer and had a higher capture probability than females. There was no difference between males and females in the movement probabilities between upland and flood zone habitat. Rolled P pruinosa leaves are both ephemeral (available to the beetles for approximately two days) and somewhat rare (I in ca 15 ramets has a rolled leaf). Adults must move from leaf to leaf ca 36 times during their average adult life span. Still, C fenestrata adults demonstrate high site fidelity.

AB The "deflection hypothesis" asserts that conspicuous marginal patches on insect wings function to deflect predator attacks toward such patches and away from more vital body parts. As a result of selection from predator attacks, these marks are predicted to increase the probability of escape by tearing relatively easily. To test if a conspicuous marginal patch is weak relative to a homologous wing area without such a patch, hindwing tear weight was compared among three Pierella species (Satyrinae) differing in the presence of a conspicuous patch in the hindwing tornus. The species with a conspicuous white hindwing patch (P astyoche) had significantly lower tear weights than the two species lacking the patch (P lamia and P lena). Forewing length did not explain variation in wing-tear weight, but wing-tear weight was positively related to insect age in a manner consistent with the deflection hypothesis. Older individuals of P lantia and P lena had higher tear weight, whereas this relationship was absent in P astyoche. These results represent the first direct evidence that deflection marks on butterfly wings are relatively weak and should have an increased tendency to tear when handled by a predator.

AB Detrimental effects of introduced honeybees (Apis mellifera L.) on native plant pollination have been predicted based on their observed deterrence or expulsion of native pollinators or their depiction of floral resources. Here, a case is reported in which floral visitation by the introduced honeybee affects male fitness and probably fruit and seed production of a tropical tree without affecting the resource sought by the native pollinator. Clusia arrudae is a dioecious species and is pollinated by individuals of Eufriesea nigrohirta that visit its flowers to collect resin. Male flowers, however, are also visited by individuals of A. mellifera, which remove ca 99 percent of their pollen grains. When E. nigrobirta leaves flowers previously visited by A. mellifera, they carry on their bodies less than 0.1 percent of the pollen grains carried by bees leaving flowers not visited by the honeybee. This may explain why the frequency of A. mellifera at male flowers is negatively correlated with the number of seeds produced by female flowers. This novel situation may affect other plants offering alternative rewards for pollinators, such as resins, oils, and aromatic compounds.

Analogous to the well-known hummingbird-mite interactions, these mites appear to use bat visitors of the lowland tropical palm Calyptrogyne ghiesbreghtiana as a means of traveling to new inflorescences. Phenology data show tight coupling between the occurrence of mites on bats and flowering phenology of C. ghiesbreghtiana, suggesting that the palm is the most important host for the mites.

AB We studied the population dynamics of the lesser long-nosed bat Leptonycteris curasoae in a cave in central Mexico for a two-year time. The population had substantial seasonal changes in size and composition during this time. Colony size was largest from February to July (22,000-27,000 adults) and contained equal numbers of males and females. In June and July, males had enlarged testes and presumably mated with females. In August, the population size began to decline and was mostly composed of pregnant females. Between September and December, the colony was composed exclusively of pregnant and lactating females and their young, and population size decreased to about one-third of the observed maximum size. In January, adult males returned to the roost and the population size increased. We also observed an increase in body mass and fat accumulation in,both sexes, apparently related to reproductive activity. This is the first report of the continuous presence of a substantial female population of L. curasoae throughout the year in a single roost in Mexican tropics, indicating that some populations of L. curasoae in central Mexico complete their life cycle without having to migrate.

AB Tropical forests are among the most heterogeneous environments on earth, and food resources for many animals are patchy both in time and space. In Africa's equatorial forest, permanent trails created and maintained by forest elephants are conspicuous features. Trails may be several meters wide and continue for tens of kilometers. Speculation on which resources determine the distribution of trails has identified fruit, browse, and mineral deposits as candidates. In this study, the relationships between these habitat variables and elephant trails were investigated. The size of individual trails and the density of the trail system increased dramatically with proximity to mineral deposits. Fruit tree basal area decreased with perpendicular distance from trails, while that of non-fruit trees did not. Fruit tree abundance and basal area were significantly higher on trail intersections than random sites and increased with intersection size. No relationship was found between monocotyledon browse abundance and elephant trail system characteristics. Clumped resources, which are at least partially reliable, provide a high nutritional payback, and are not rapidly depleted and can thus be visited repeatedly, appear to influence permanent trail formation by forest elephants. Permanent trails may allow naive individuals or those with imperfect knowledge to locate and acquire important resources.

AB Canopy invertebrates may reflect changes in tree structure and microhabitat that are brought about by human activities. We used the canopy fogging method to collect ants from tree crowns in primary forest, secondary forest, and pasture in a Neotropical cloud forest landscape. The total number of species collected was similar in primary forest (21) and pasture (20) habitats, but lower in secondary forest (9). Lower diversity in secondary forest was caused by lower species density (no. of species per sample). Rarefaction curves based on number of species occurrences suggest similar community species richness among the three habitats. This Study has implications for conservation of tropical montane habitats in two ways. First, arboreal ant species density is reduced if secondary forest replaces primary forest, which increases the chance of extinction among rare species. Second, pasture trees may serve as repositories of primary forest ant communities due to similar tree structure.

AB We show that tropical forest tree saplings with greater belowground carbon allocation have more breakage scars along their stems. We suggest the existence of alternative carbon allocation strategies in relation to physical damage in the forest understorey. "Tolerators" allocate more belowground, have enhanced resprouting ability and slower aboveground growth, whereas "escapers" allocate less belowground, are not well prepared for recovering from damage, but grow fast enough to escape from the damage-susceptible size class.

AB The tropical mountain cloud forest bromeliads studied thus far have been reported as self compatible; however, whether or not autogamy and apomixis occur is not known. We characterized the breeding system of Werauchia sintenisii using a series of treatments to detect self-compatibility, autogamy, and apomixes. The natural fruit set of this population was 97 percent. Pollen origin (self vs. cross) did not affect fruit and seed set. Werauhia sintenisii is autogamous but not apomictic. All pollinator-excluded flowers produced fruits, but flowers that were emasculated and caged did not produce any fruit. Factors affecting the evolution of autogamy in this system are discussed.

AB In tropical forests, rodents exert a prominent role as post-dispersal seed predators, while other vertebrates apparently have a minor effect on seed predation. In some forest fragments in southeast Brazil, however, the density of rodents is unusually low, whereas terrestrial granivorous birds are abundant. In this study, we used seeds of a second-growth tree (Croton priscus, Euphorbiaceae) to investigate experimentally the relative importance of rodents and birds as seed predators in a forest fragment. We also estimated the density of terrestrial granivorous birds and trapped small mammals. Results indicate that, as a consequence of decreased rodent population and increased bird abundance, the latter are at least as important as the former as the main post-dispersal seed predators of C priscus. We interpret such apparent imbalance in the interaction between C priscus and their seed predators as a possible consequence of forest fragmentation.

After considering intrinsic mortality (19%) and potential emigration (negligible), we estimated that 54 percent of the nymphs died due to predation in a two-week period. Predation on nymphs was highest at night and may explain the low abundance of Metriophasma diodes in the understory.

Ants removed more defecated washed seeds in the wet season, while during the dry season, removal was greater for syconia seeds and defecated washed seeds. Our results suggest that ants tended to remove more seeds when they were not embedded in feces; however, even seeds set on howler dung were still attractive to ants.

AB Plant distributions are changing at unprecedented rates, primarily due to habitat clearance and the spread of alien invasive species. Landscape pattern and local density can affect plant sexual processes, particularly those mediated by biotic vectors, by acting on the composition and behavior of pollinators and seed dispersers. Ecologists are now grappling with the likely effects of these altered processes on future forest composition as existing plant reproductive mutualisms break down or adjust to new spatial circumstances. Here, we introduce five papers that address pollinator responses and pollination outcomes in a variety of human-dominated landscapes and emphasize the need to better understand the dynamic nature of plant-pollinator interactions.

AB Forest fragmentation and the resulting spatial isolation of tree species can modify the activity of pollinators and may have important implications for the reproductive success and mating systems of the plants they pollinate. The objectives of this study were to (1) evaluate the effect of forest fragmentation on pollinator activity in bat-pollinated bombacaceous trees and (2) determine the effects of forest fragmentation on reproductive success and mating systems of bombacaceous trees. We studied these parameters in three bombacaceous tree species in tropical seasonal forest of Chamela, Jalisco, Mexico, and Osa and Guanacaste, Costa Rica. For Ceiba aesculifolia, more visits were observed in fragments by both Glossophaga soricina and Leptonycteris curasoae. For Ceiba grandiflora, Musonycteris harrisoni visited flowers exclusively in forest and G. soricina visited more flowers in forest than in fragments; no difference was shown by L. curasoae. For Ceiba pentandra in Chamela, no differences were found in visitation by G. soricina between forest and fragments; L. curasoae visited significantly more flowers in forest. Ceiba pentandra received more visits by Phyllostomus discolor than G. soricina in Guanacaste, whereas no bat visitors were observed in Osa. Total mean flower production was greater in fragments than forest for C aesculifolia, whereas no difference was observed for C. grandiflora.. Fruit set was greater in forest than in fragments for C. grandiflora, whereas no difference was observed for C aesculifolia. Outcrossing rates were high for C aesculifolia and C grandiflora in Chamela, and for C pentandra in Guanacaste, independent of tree habitat, while C. pentandra in Osa showed a mixed-mating system. The effects of forest fragmentation on bat pollinators, plant reproductive success, and mating patterns varied depending upon the bombacaceous species. This variability was associated with the effects that forest fragmentation may have on differences in flowering patterns, bat foraging behavior, and plant self-incompatibility systems.

AB Fruit set is pollen-limited in the self-incompatible tree Heterophragma quadriloculare (Bignoniaceae), pollinated by long-distance flying carpenter bees, and in the self-compatible shrub Lasiosiphon eriocephalus (Thymeleaceae), pollinated by weak-flying, sedentary beetles. We studied a single H. quadriloculare population over high and low flowering years and found no difference in bee visitation rates between these years. For H. quadriloculare, neighborhood floral display did not make a significant contribution to reproductive success. We investigated dense and sparse L. eriocephalus populations in the same year. In the low density L. eriocephalus population, individual floral displays were higher than in the dense population, yet reproductive success was low, indicating that plant isolation was a major factor influencing fruit set. This result was due to the extremely low number of beetles per plant and per flower in this population. In the dense L. eriocephalus population, although the displays of individual neighbors were smaller and plants were closer, neighborhood floral display did not contribute significantly to reproductive success, whereas the effect of individual floral display was ambiguous. Species with self-incompatible rather than self-compatible breeding systems are expected to experience neighborhood effects on reproductive success; however, at the spatial scale and floral display levels of plants in this study, only individual floral display affected fruit set in H. quadriloculare, whereas neither individual nor neighborhood display influenced fruit set in L. eriocephalus. Therefore, pollinator type, pollinator behavior, and plant and population isolation, rather than breeding system alone, will determine if neighborhood floral display affects fruit set.

AB The species-rich mist-belt grasslands of southern Africa have been severely reduced in extent as a result of commercial afforestation, thus confining many endemic plants and animals to small populations in habitat fragments. We investigated the influence of various environmental factors on seed production and seedling recruitment in remnant populations of the endangered grassland herb Gerbera aurantiaca (Asteraceae). Experiments with color traps showed that Eriesthis beetles, which appear to be the primary pollinators of G. aurantiaca, were most abundant in the two largest extant populations. Seeds are produced in a very small proportion (typically <10%) of the ca 80 female florets in a capitulum. The mean number of seeds produced in undamaged capitula was found to be significantly lower in small than in large populations. Pollen limitation was evident from a significant overall increase in seed set after supplemental pollination in three populations over two seasons. The proportion of capitula containing seed predators did not differ marked among populations or years, but lepidopteran larvae, which destroy all of the seeds in a capitulum, were most abundant in the two largest populations in 2003. The presence of juvenile plants varied markedly among populations, but this could not be linked firmly to estimates of seed production. Clonal growth is likely to contribute to the persistence of small isolated populations of G. aurantiaca, even when seed production is severely compromised by pollen limitation and predation.

AB The indirect impacts of Shorea siamensis-logging on the reproductive ecology of Dipterocarpus obtusifolius, a self- incompatible butterfly-, moth-, and bird-pollinated tree, were studied in tropical dry forest in Thailand. Pollinator activity at D. obtusifolius trees and subsequent seed production were recorded in three forest areas subject to differing intensities of S. siamensis extraction. The pollinator and plant understory communities in these areas were also noted. Forest areas subject to high S. siamensis extraction intensities had very high understory flowering plant cover, dominated by the exotic invader Chromolaena odorata. Activity of butterfly pollinators at D. obtusifolius trees decreased in these disturbed areas, although their abundance remained comparable to other forest areas subject to only moderate or no extraction. For sphingid moth pollinators, there was no difference across differentially disturbed forest areas in either abundance or in the proportion bearing pollen. Pollinator activity by birds increased at highly disturbed locations but was not sufficient to offset a decline in overall pollinator activity at D. obtusifolius canopies in areas of heavy S. siamensis extraction. Thus, extraction of S. siamensis indirectly affected the pollination of D. obtusifolius, primarily by causing changes in the foraging behavior of butterfly pollinators rather than their abundance. A shift in the relative abundance of floral nectar resources from the canopy to the understory a consequence of S. siamensis extraction and invasion by C odorata, led to a parallel shift in foraging location of the principal diurnal pollinators, the butterflies, toward the understory. Despite reduced pollination at disturbed sites, behavioral changes did not translate into a D. obtusifolius seed set effect, possibly because pollination by birds (or moths) at the disturbed site compensated for reduced butterfly pollination.

AB Animals, especially insects, are principal pollen vectors of tropical trees and have behavior patterns that affect gene dispersal. Here, we explore complex pollination systems using a new simulation model Eco-Gene and considering, among other factors, flowering synchrony. spatial distribution of trees, degree of selfing, population densities, pollinator flight distances, pollen deposition, and pollinator response to floral display size. Sensitivity analyses using two contrasting tree data sets (Jacaranda copaia and Dipteryx odorata) determined the importance of each parameter on three response variables: the proportion of seeds from self-pollination, effective population size, and pollen dispersal. Spatial considerations and attractiveness of floral displays were prominent features determining the population genetic result of pollinators, and some biological implications of the results are discussed.

AB The five papers in this Special Section illustrate that pollination processes are often disrupted by changing plant distributions. They further demonstrate that plant pollination and seed production outcomes are highly complex due to multidimensional spatial effects and numerous interactive biological responses of both plants and pollinators at individual and population scales. Nevertheless, these studies also lend support to some emerging generalities that (through modeling) begin to provide a coherent framework by which further research, and ultimately management planning, could proceed.

AB The soil microbial biomass is largely responsible for the transformation of organic matter and the associated mineralization of important nutrients that regulate plant productivity. While the controls on soil microbial biomass and activity in temperate ecosystems have been well investigated, there is a paucity of such information from tropical rain forest ecosystems. Hence, we used a natural soil gradient (nutrient-poor oxisols and nutrient-rich mollisols) to investigate seasonal changes in the size and activity of the soil microbial community in two primary tropical rain forest sites in southwestern Costa Rica. In a nutrient-poor oxisol, microbial biomass ranged from 952 mug/g in the dry season (February) to 1967 mug/g in the wet season (June). The greater microbial biomass estimates corresponded to greater rates of microbial activity in the oxisol forest; however, the active fraction of the soil microbial biomass remained consistently low, regardless of soil C availability. In addition, while there was very little seasonal variability in microbial C:N ratios, we found extreme variations in seasonal microbial C:P ratios, with the highest microbial C:P ratio occurring when microbial biomass C was at a maximum. Our results suggest the importance of P availability in regulating soil microbial processes and that decomposition during the wet season (of litter accumulated in the previous dry season) may play an important role in driving seasonal changes in microbial biomass and activity.

AB We studied nectar characteristics in 12 species of Neotropical hummingbird-pollinated plants: Aphelandra golfodulcensis, A. sinclairiana, A. storkii, Justicia aurea (Acanthaceae); Heliconia irrasa, H. latispatha, H. mathiasii (Heliconiaceae); Pavonia dasypetala (Malvaceae); Isertia haenkeana, Palicourea guianense, Pentagonia macrophylla (Rubiaceae); and Renealmia cernua (Zingiberaceae). The diurnal patterns in sugar content and cumulative volume of nectar were documented in flowers that were protected from flower visitors. Sugar content in these species (mean of all flowers sampled per species ranged from 16 to 28%) was comparable to those reported for other hummingbird-pollinated species. Mean nectar volume per flower spanned an order of magnitude (i.e., 8.8 [Palicourea]-72.7 mul [H. latispatha]), indicating that hummingbirds visited flowers with a wide range of reward. We observed low intraspecific variation in sugar content but high variation in nectar volume. Among species, 10-50 percent of the variation in nectar volume was explained by time of day. For a subset of four species (A. sinclairiana, Isertia, Palicourea, and Pentagonia), we studied variation among individuals in nectar volume. With time of day controlled, individual explained as much as 70 percent of the variation in nectar volume (A. sinclairiana) and as little as 20 percent (Pentagonia). We suggest that nectar volume likely has a genetic component in these species, but also that variation may itself be a trait, especially in Palicourea and Pentagonia. In three of the four species for which we had data from individuals, mean nectar volume and standard deviation were not correlated, suggesting that these traits may vary independently (Pentagonia was the exception with mean and standard deviation positively correlated). For two species (Isertia and Palicourea), we found evidence of seasonal variation in nectar production, with more nectar per flower produced early in the flowering season than later.

AB We documented the diurnal pattern of nectar volumes in flowers of seven Neotropical hummingbird-pollinated plant species that were open to flower visitors and compared these standing crop data to nectar volumes in flowers protected from visitors. Standing crop of nectar bore little relationship to nectar in bagged flowers either in terms of volume or temporal pattern of availability. There was almost no nectar in open flowers except in those collected at dawn and those of Aphelandra sinclairiana; these were apparently too abundant to be depleted by visitors. Nectar volumes in open flowers were even more variable than in bagged flowers. We argue that understanding the evolution of plant-pollinator interactions requires understanding the relationship between nectar production and standing crop, as well as the impact of high variability on decisions by foraging animals. We conducted experiments to determine the effect of nectar removal on nectar production. Nectar removal via simulated legitimate visits had no impact on total production in flowers of Pavonia, Isertia, and Palicourea. For A. sinclairiana and Pentagonia, total nectar production in visited flowers was reduced compared to unvisited flowers. Data from individuals of these last two species indicated that the population-level pattern was assembled from individuals that responded differently to nectar removal; clearly, understanding the evolution of nectar traits demands data from individuals. We argue that detecting patterns of plant responses to nectar removal requires the context of floral characteristics (e.g., longevity, ovule number, or pollinators). Nectar removal via simulated nectar-robbing visits had no impact on total nectar production in A. sinclairiana but reduced total production in Isertia. Nectar robbing did not cause plants to invest more energy in nectar than they would have the absence of robbing. Finally, we found no difference in seed set by robbed and unrobbed flowers of A. sinclairiana. Our results add to a growing body of literature suggesting that nectar robbers are not always detrimental to plant fitness.

AB This study compared elephant use of woody vegetation on termite mounds with surrounding woodlands in western Zimbabwe. Twelve sites consisting of paired plots on termite mounds and in woodlands were selected. At each site, soil and vegetation samples (leaf and stem) were collected for chemical analysis. Both soil and plant samples were analyzed for calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, and phosphorus, and plant samples were also analyzed for crude protein concentration. Two indices of elephant feeding damage were computed: the median number of stems and branches removed per plant, and the mass of stems and branches removed by elephants per unit area. Termite mound soils had higher concentrations of all elements tested than soils from woodlands, and termite mounds differed from woodland plots in terms of plant species composition. Trees growing on termite mounds had higher concentrations of all nutrients except sodium and crude protein, and were subjected to more intense feeding by elephants than trees from the surrounding vegetation matrix. Termite mounds may play an important role in determining food availability and spatial feeding patterns by elephants and other herbivores.

AB We investigated the distribution patterns of leaf mining insects along an elevational gradient in cerrado vegetation of southeastern Brazil. We tested four hypotheses related to the distribution of mining insects: (1) the "altitudinal gradient hypothesis," which predicts that mining insect species richness will decrease with altitude or elevation; (2) the "habitat-mediated richness hypothesis," which predicts that mining insect species richness will be higher in mesic habitats than in xeric habitats; (3) the "plant species richness hypothesis," which predicts that mining insect species richness will be positively correlated with plant species richness; and (4) the "plant architecture hypothesis," which predicts a positive correlation between mining insect species richness and plant structural complexity. A total of 33,000 herbs, 3520 shrubs, and 1760 trees were sampled at 44 sites across an elevational gradient of 700 m. Mining insect species richness and plant species richness showed a negative correlation with elevation in xeric habitats, while in mesic habitats mining insect species and plant species richness did not show any statistically significant relationship with elevation. The differential distribution of mining insect species between xeric and mesic habitats supported the habitat-mediated richness hypothesis, which states that miners would be more speciose in mesic, more favorable habitats. Mining species richness also increased with increasing plant structural complexity. The results suggest that the mining habit may not represent a strong adaptive strategy in protecting mining insects against desiccation.

AB The Wood Stork (Mycteria americana) is a wading bird inhabiting subtropical and tropical regions of the American continent. This species is considered endangered in the United States. We compared variability and genetic structuring of nine Brazilian Pantanal subpopulations with an North American population using eight allozyme loci data (MPI, ICD, NSP, EST-D, LDH, PGM, 6PGD, and PEP-A) and four microsatellite loci data (WS1, WS2, WS4, and WS6). Average expected heterozygosity of Pantanal population was similar (0.198 +/- 0.065) to that expected for the North American population (0.231 +/- 0.066). No significant genetic differentiation was found among Pantanal subpopulations (F-st = 0.012) and low differentiation was detected between Pantanal and North American populations (F-st = 0.023). Lack of differentiation among Pantanal subpopulations may have been due to high gene flow level among birds of neighbor breeding colonies and low natal philopatry. We propose that low differentiation between North and South American populations has arisen either because these populations occupied neighboring regions during late glaciation or because there is a continuous gene flow between them, via Central American or northern South American populations.

Insect assemblages were typical of tropical island streams and insects were found in all stream habitats. Shrimp impacted insects directly via predation and competition and indirectly through removing particles from the water column. Variation in shrimp distribution is likely to be an important factor determining insect-assemblage structure in tropical streams.

AB Workers of Paraponera clavata, a common Neotropical ant, collect both nectar and insect prey. Previous reports show that nectar accounts for up to 90 percent of the ants' food loads, while calculations suggest that nectar contributes only 10 percent of colonies' energy supply. We assessed the trophic source of carbon and nitrogen in adult workers using stable isotope analysis. Carbon in adult workers was largely derived from plant sources. Worker nitrogen isotopic ratios varied significantly among colonies and were enriched compared to prey. Prey nitrogen isotope ratios suggest considerable intercolonial variation in diet, with some colonies collecting prey from lower trophic levels than other colonies. The importance of nectar as a source of metabolic carbon in adult worker biomass, coupled with the high frequency of nectar collection, supports the conclusion that omnivory is a key to supporting this species' biomass in Neotropical wet forests.

Using logistic regression analyses, we examined the relationship between the loss of butterflies and their specific hostplants from the tropical island of Singapore and report the probable occurrence of their co-extinctions at the community level. Our simulation shows that the number of extinct butterfly species is expected to increase exponentially with that of extinct hostplants. The close association between butterflies and their hostplants suggests that the preservation of whole habitats is urgently needed if we are to avoid the possible cascading effects of species (co-) extinctions.

To promote the kind of geographically comparative tropical ecology advocated in the 1990 Gentry book, the Organization for Tropical Studies and the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute organized a course in 2001 that visited each of these field stations. Papers from some of the studies resulting from this course are highlighted in this special section. These studies are notable for the consistent methods applied across forests, and they underscore the acute need and bright future for comparative tropical ecology. Key site characteristics for each of the field stations are summarized here.

AB We contrasted the structure and biomass of four lowland Neotropical forests (La Selva, Costa Pica; Barro Colorado Island, Panama; Cocha Cashu, Peru; and KM41, Brazil) to determine if commonalities exist within and among forests differing in latitude, rainfall, seasonality, and soil fertility. We examined the effect of soil fertility specifically by measuring the density and basal area of trees, lianas, and palms on two soil types differing in fertility at each site. We used allometric relationships to estimate the contribution of the various life-forms to total aboveground biomass (AGB) and compared two relationships for trees 30 cm diameter or greater. Estimated liana density and AGB were similar among sites, but the density and AGB of trees and palms, estimated using diameter alone, differed significantly. Basal area and AGB of trees 10 cm diameter at breast height (DBH) or greater differed among forests and averaged 30.2 m(2)/ha and 250 Mg/ha, respectively. Cocha Cashu and KM41 had higher tree basal area and AGB than La Selva or Barro Colorado Island. Across forests, lianas and small trees (1-10 cm DBH) each contributed between 4 and 5 percent of the total AGB and small palms contributed ca I percent. Many forest inventories ignore lianas, as well as trees and palms less than 10 cm DBH, and therefore underestimate AGB by ca 10 percent. Soil type had little influence on the forest structure within sites, except at Cocha Cashu where total AGB was much higher and liana density much lower on the more fertile old floodplain Entisols than the terra firme Oxisols. Although total stem density basal area, and some biomass components differed significantly among forests, they seemed less variable than other quantitative measures (e.g., species richness).

AB Variation in climate and soils results in inter-site differences in the assemblages of tree life history strategies within a community which has important implications for ecosystem structure and dynamics. I investigated interspecific and inter-site variation in wood specific gravity-an easily measured indicator of tree life history strategy-in four Neotropical forests and analyzed its correlates. Mean wood specific gravity (oven-dry weight divided by fresh volume, sometimes also referred to as wood density in the literature) differed significantly among sites, varying inversely with soil fertility and independently of rainfall, seasonality and temperature. Mean wood specific gravity values were much higher at Kilometer 41, Manaus, Brazil, where soils are extremely poor, than at Cocha Cashu, Peru, Barro Colorado Island, Panama, or La Selva, Costa Rica, where soils are better and mortality rates of trees are higher. Within sites, wood specific gravity varied widely among species. On Barro Colorado Island, among-species variation was significantly, albeit weakly, negatively correlated with sapling and tree mortality and relative growth rates. Altogether, the results suggest that the distribution of tree life history strategies in a community varies substantially among sites, with important consequences for community and ecosystem properties such as aboveground carbon stores.

AB Understory light availability is an important component of the environment for canopy tree seedlings. Understanding what generates variation in understory light availability represents one step in understanding processes regulating seedling banks, the beginning capital of regeneration in tropical forests. Near the forest floor, variation in light availability may be strongly influenced by the structure and composition of the understory. I examined abundance of understory foliage and patterns of light attenuation in five Neotropical forests (La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica = LS; Barro Colorado Nature Monument, Panama = BCI; Cocha Cashu Biological Station, Mann National Park, Peru = CC; Kilometer 41, Manaus, Brazil = KM41; and Nouragues, French Guiana = NG). I used hemispherical canopy photos to estimate light availability at two heights (0.65 and 1.7 m) above the forest floor and counted foliage between these heights. Light availability differed significantly among sites, and site rankings depended on measurement height. At 0.65 m, NG had significantly lower mean light availability than CC, with KM41, LS, and BCI equivalent and intermediate. At 1.7 m, light availability was still lowest at NG, and highest at CC, but LS had levels similar to CC while KM41 and BCI remained intermediate. Across sites, light attenuation was positively related to foliage density. LS had the most understory foliage and the highest light attenuation between 0.65 and 1.7 In. KM41, NG and CC had intermediate amounts of foliage and intermediate light attenuation. BCI had the lowest density of understory foliage and no difference between light at the two measurement heights. My results show significant effects of understory foliage on understory light and indicate that the selective environment of canopy tree seedlings differs among sites.

AB Even though many forest plants spend all or a significant portion of their lives in the forest understory, few studies have compared understory composition, structure, and resource availability among forests. We used standardized transect-based methods to compare small sapling densities (10-50 cm tall), understory vegetation cover, canopy openness, and nutrient availability in non-gap portions of four lowland Neotropical forests: La Selva, Costa Rica (LS), Barro Colorado Island, Panama (BCI), Cocha Cashu, Peru (CC), and north of Manaus, Brazil (KM41). Sites differed significantly in all variables except canopy openness. LS had high palm and non-fern herb cover and low density of small saplings (0.7-1.6/m(2)) compared to other sites. CC had high fern cover, whereas BCI had low cover in all small categories: of understory vegetation (palms, ferns, and non-fern herbaceous plants). BCI, CC, and KM41 had similar I sap ling densities, ranging from 4.8-7.5/m(2). Within each forest, cation (Ca, Mg, K, and Na) availability was usually higher on more fertile soil orders (Inceptisols, Alfisols, and Entisols) than on more weathered soil types (Ultisols and Oxisols). Extractable P was highest at LS and CC and lowest on BCI (no data for KM41). Spatial autocorrelation was present for some variables in some transects to distances beyond our detection ability (>25 m). Understory palm cover was negatively correlated with small sapling density at fine (1 m(2) quadrat) and coarse spatial scales (among forests), although across forests the effect of palms was due entirely to the difference between LS and the other three forests. These results provide cross-site support for the hypothesis that understory cover by palms decreases the density of small saplings that comprise the advance regeneration of the forest.

AB Composition of pioneer tree species was recorded for 23 to 76 treefalls in the forests of La Selva (LS), Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Cocha Cashu Research Station (CC), and KM41 to evaluate the hypothesis that distance to secondary forests influences the composition of pioneer tree species at scales of thousands of hectares and to assess the relative importance of distance to seed sources compared to two microenvironmental factors: soil and gap size. Discriminant function analysis (DFA) was used to assess the relative importance of the landscape and environmental factors in controlling the presence in gaps of Cecropia species that are typical of secondary forests regenerating after large-scale disturbances. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used as an ordination technique based on pioneer species composition of each gap. The PCA ordination axes were regressed against soil type, gap size, forest type, and distance values of each site to explore the relationship between composition and control factors. At the four sites, the variable best correlated to the discriminant function of gaps with and without Cecropia was the distance to secondary forests, although such discriminant function was statistically significant at only one site. In three of the four sites (with the exception of BCI, where there are no typical young secondary forests), distance to secondary forests was correlated with at least one axis of the PCA (P < 0.06). Other significant correlations included soil variables (CC and KM41), gap size (KM41), and forest type (secondary vs. primary; BCI). Overall, the results provide some support for the hypothesis that at the spatial scale of this study, distance to young secondary forests (both natural and anthropogenic) influences treefall gap composition at a level comparable to endogenous and exogenous microenvironmental factors.

AB Hurricanes are important disturbance events in many forested ecosystems. They can have strong effects on both forest structure and animal populations, and yet few studies have considered the impacts on plant-animal interactions. Reduction of canopy cover by severe winds increases light availability to understory plants, providing an opportunity for increased growth. An increase in light availability should cause an increase in annual production of leaves and a more even production throughout the year (i.e., less seasonality in production). This change will affect the availability of food resources to folivorous insects that feed primarily on young leaves; outbreaks of these insects could nullify the temporary advantage of increased understory light levels. On 21 September 1998, Hurricane Georges struck Puerto Rico, providing an excellent opportunity to determine the effect of the hurricane on leaf production and herbivory in the forest understory by comparing post-hurricane data with data obtained from a previous study conducted at the same site. Eight species were analyzed at El Verde Field Station, a wet forest site in eastern Puerto Rico. For the eight species combined, there was an increase in number of leaves produced after the hurricane and a more even seasonal pattern of leaf production, as predicted. Levels of herbivory were much lower (2.03%) after the hurricane compared with pre hurricane conditions (16.05%), indicating that increased light availability to understory plants was not offset by increased herbivory. Lower levels of herbivory were possibly due to herbivore satiation, changes in leaf chemistry, changes in herbivore populations, changes in herbivore predator populations, or a combination of two or more of these factors.

AB Although herbivory can affect plant fitness, few studies have investigated the effects of herbivory on the fitness of plants that reproduce vegetatively via fragmentation. Plants that reproduce in this manner are common in tropical wet forest understories, where they are subject to damage from falling branches and other debris. For these species, the ability to reproduce via fragmentation may be affected by the extent of herbivory. In this study, we determined the effects of natural and artificial herbivory on plant fragments. The leaves of four tropical understory plant species were either damaged artificially or chosen based on the extent of existing damage. Effects of real and artificial herbivory ranged from strong to no effects depending on the plant species and biotic conditions. Insect-damaged fragments showed stronger effects than artificially damaged fragments. Herbivory may be an important predictor of mortality in reproductive fragments of understory plants.

AB This study investigated the seed dispersal of the canopy palm Attalea oleifera in a 3500 ha fragment of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We monitored ten fruiting palms during six months, when the following mammals were recorded feeding on Attalea fruits and/or seeds: (1) Brazilian squirrels (Sciurus aestuans, 78 diurnal records); (2) white-eared opossums (Didelphis albiventris, 8 nocturnal records); (3) black-humped agoutis (Dasyprocta prymnolopba, 3 diurnal records); (4) pacas (Agouti paca, I nocturnal record); (5) rice rats (Oryzomys capito, I I nocturnal records); and (6) short-tailed opossums (Monodelphis americana, 4 diurnal records). Fruit removal on the ground reached 71.9 +/- 21.9 percent after a three-month period, and most fruits were moved less than 5 m from parental palms. Squirrels generally moved fruits and endocarps 5-10 m from parents, whereas opossums, pacas, and agoutis moved 91.7, 78, and 74.1 percent of fruits less than 5 m, respectively. Oviposition on endocarps by the bruchid Pachymeros cardo ranged between 62.1 and 84.3 percent of endocarps previously manipulated by white-eared opossums, squirrels, and rice rats, whereas 57.9 percent of old endocarps collected around reproductive palms were attacked by bruchids. Moreover, oviposition on endocarps varied from 42.3 percent in the case of single endocarps to 70.9 percent of endocarps in piles. Attalea seeds abundantly germinated beneath parental palms despite the high levels of predation, and distribution of both seedlings and adults suggested that squirrels played an important role in palm recruitment at the study site.

AB We examined morphological and genetic data for Chirostoma grandocule, the most abundant silverside fish from Lake Patzcuaro, Michoacan, Mexico, as part of a larger project to clarify the genetic structure of the genus. We analyzed 19 morphometric, 8 meristic, and I I putative enzyme-coding loci from C grandocule samples from two different localities within the lake during three different years (Janitzio 1996, 1999, and Ichupio 1997). Because morphometric attributes were all correlated, scores derived from reciprocal averaging analysis were used to describe the variation in fish morphology. Discriminant analysis using 10 morphometric and 8 meristic variables revealed significant differences between samples (Janitzio and Ichupio, chi(2) = 558.4 and 531.5, P < 0.001, respectively). The utilization of morphometric features for the reclassification of organisms into the site of origin was highly effective ((x) over bar = 98.2%). Allozyme data resolved seven polymorphic loci (P-0.99) and levels of heterocigosis that ranged from 0.0134 to 0.0319 ((x) over bar H-e = 0.0234). Weir and Cockerham's F-statistics provided evidence of low but significant heterogeneity between sites and years (jackknifed Os = 0.0252, SD = 0.0126); a pairwise comparison of OS values revealed that the sample from Ichupio was highly distinct compared to the samples from Janitzio (0.0400 vs. 0.0033, P < 0.05), indicating intra-lacustrine differentiation between the north and south samples. Genetic co-ancestry distances between samples ranged from 0.0154 to 0.0341. The genetic and morphometric variation detected in C grandocule's samples are discussed in the light of differences in sex ratio and of the contrasted environmental and physio-geographical intra-lacustrine conditions.

AB In the highly fragmented landscape of Los Tuxtlas, Mexico, we studied seed rain, seed bank, and vegetation established beneath the canopies of five fig trees (Ficus spp.) isolated in pastures. The area beneath the canopy of each fig tree was enclosed with a barbed wire fence to exclude cattle, and weeding with machete and herbicide spraying were stopped. Annual seed rain beneath the canopy of the five trees was 20,936 seeds (1066 seeds/m(2)) belonging to 149 species. Seed rain was dominated by woody species dispersed by frugivorous birds and bats. Most captured seeds (94%) were small (seed diam < 3 mm). A total of 6290 individuals from 78 species germinated from the seed bank (1258 seeds/m(2)). Ruderal herbs dominated the seed bank (52% of spp. and 77% of seeds). After three years of exclusion, a dense, 4-5 m tall understory comprised of woody plants developed beneath the canopy of the five fig trees. A total of 621 plants (4.6 plants/m(2)) from 95 species were recorded along 15 transects placed beneath the canopy of the fenced trees. Primary forest and pioneer tree and shrub species dominated species richness (55%) and abundance (37%) of established vegetation, but secondary and pioneer species had higher overall biomass. Most of the established plants (68%) had relatively large seeds (>3 mm). When cattle was excluded and management practices were stopped, remnant trees in Los Tuxtlas pastures effectively favored the early establishment of late successional species, including large-seeded canopy and subcanopy trees.

AB Habitat fragmentation can have consequences on plant reproduction through several interactions with insects. We studied the effects of habitat fragmentation in the proportion of aborted, predated and undamaged seeds of Acacia aroma and Cercidium praecox. We performed this study in the Chaco Serrano of Argentina. We found that fragmentation effects differed between species. In small patches, the number of aborted seeds of A. aroma increased and the number of pre-dispersal predated seeds and undamaged seeds of C praecox decreased and increased, respectively. However, higher numbers of aborted seeds in small patches did not lead to fewer available seeds for dispersion. For these species, seed predation by bruchids was about 35 percent and aborted seeds were around 7 percent. Because of the elevated levels of damage and the high specificity of bruchids, the changes caused by habitat fragmentation may be very important for the populations of these two species. Habitat fragmentation effects on pollination and predispersal seed predation of these legumes may determine higher availability of seeds for dispersion in fragmented habitats.

Counts of macaw-damaged fruit below 50 focal trees in a Peruvian Brazil nut harvesting concession indicated that macaws destroyed about 10 percent of the concession's crop. We compared this impact to other sources of variation in profits from harvesting and suggest methods to compensate harvesters while encouraging them to conserve macaws in their concessions.

AB Information on an undescribed keroplatid fly (tribe Orfeliini) from Cameroon is presented. Its myrmecophagous larvae live in hollow stems of an understory myrmecophytic tree. Data on the biology of this fly and its interaction with one of the plant's strictly associated ant species Cataulacus mckeyi (Myrmicinae) showed that the number of keroplatid larvae per tree was not limited by occupation competition with the ant. Through predation on workers, keroplatid larvae may have a sizeable impact on colonies of C mckeyi.

AB Changes in forest structure and species diversity throughout secondary succession were studied using a chronosequence at two sites in the Bolivian Amazon. Secondary forests ranging in age from 2 to 40 years as well as mature forests were included, making a total of 14 stands. Fifty plants per forest layer (understory, subcanopy, and canopy) were sampled using the transect of variable area technique. Mean and maximum height, total stem density basal area, and species number were calculated at the stand level. Species diversity was calculated for each stand and for each combination of forest layer and stand. A correspondence analysis was performed, and the relationship between relative abundance of the species and stand age was modeled using a set of hierarchical models. Canopy height and basal area increased with stand age, indicating that secondary forests rapidly attain a forest structure similar in many respects to mature forests. A total of 250 species were recorded of which ca 50 percent made up 87 percent of the sampled individuals. Species diversity increased with stand age and varied among the forest layers, with the lowest diversity in the canopy. The results of the correspondence analysis indicated that species composition varies with stand age, forest layer, and site. The species composition of mature forests recovered at different rates in the different forest layers, being the slowest in the canopy layer. Species showed different patterns of abundance in relation to stand age, supporting the current model of succession.

AB I investigated the effects of successional stage and micro-elevation on seedling establishment of Calophyllum brasiliense (Clusiaceae), a common canopy tree of seasonally flooded lowland forest along the Mand River meander zone in southeastern Peru. To compare seedling establishment between microhabitat types, I planted C brasiliense seeds in a fully crossed experimental design of three successional stages (early, mid, and mature) and two micro-elevations (levees and backwaters). Seedling establishment success in this study was affected by both successional stage and microelevation, but micro-elevation was most important in mid-successional habitats. In general, seedlings in early succession experienced better conditions than in mature forest; light levels were higher, herbivory lower, and seedling growth higher. In mid-successional forest, micro-elevation determined habitat quality; back-waters had higher light levels, lower herbivory, and higher seedling growth and survival than levees. Mid-successional backwaters were similar in quality to early successional forest for seedling establishment, while levees in that same successional stage were the poorest microhabitats for establishment. Although mid-successional backwaters are similar to early succession for seedling establishment, in the long run, seedlings that establish in mid-succession have a lower chance of reaching reproductive size before their habitat ages to mature forest than members of their cohort that established in early succession. I hypothesize that successful recruitment for C brasiliense in the Mand River meander system requires dispersal to early successional habitat.

AB Seedling dynamics were followed in a Puerto Rican forest for 20 months following a severe hurricane to study the interactive effects of hurricane debris, nutrients, and light on seedling diversity density, growth, and mortality. Three treatments (debris removal, an unaltered control with hurricane debris, and chemical fertilization added to hurricane debris) altered levels of forest debris and soil nutrients. Canopy openness was measured twice using hemispherical photographs of the canopy. We examined the demographic responses of six common species to treatments over time. Seedling densities increased for all six species but the only significant treatment effects were increased densities of the pioneer tree Cecropia and the shrub Palicourea in the debris removal treatment. Seedling growth declined with declining light levels for four species but not for the pioneer tree Alchornea or the non-pioneer tree Dacryodes. Only Cecropia and the non-pioneer tree Chionanthus had treatment effects on growth. Mortality also differed among species and tended to be highest in the fertilized plots for all but Cecropia and Dacryodes. We found only come of the expected differences between pioneer and non-pioneer plants, as each species had a unique response to the patchy distributions of organic debris, nutrients, and light following the hurricane. High local species diversity was maintained through the individualistic responses of seedlings after a disturbance.

AB We studied the concentration of leaf N and C among 183 fern species along an elevational gradient at 1700 to 3400 m in humid montane forest in the Bolivian Andes at different levels of taxonomic resolution. For two species of Elaphoglossum sampled 8 and 14 times, respectively, there were no elevational trends. Similarly, a contrast of 22 species with wide elevational amplitudes sampled at their highest and lowest locations did not show any change in C or N contents, or in C:N ratios with elevation. At the community level, however, the mean values of C:N ratios for (a) all species found at a given elevation showed a significant decline with increasing elevation and (b) among epiphytic species, higher ratios (i.e., lower relative N content) than among terrestrial species at the same elevation. These trends were opposite to those of the upper soil layer, in which C:N ratios increased with elevation.

AB The aims of this study were to (1) characterize the food resources exploited by fruit bats (Pteropodidae) within an old-growth Malaysian dipterocarp forest, (2) test the viability of the seeds they disperse, and (3) provide an estimate of the proportion of trees that are to some degree dependent upon bats for seed dispersal and/or pollination. Fruit species exploited by bats could be distinguished from those eaten by birds largely on the basis of color (as perceived by human beings). Bat-dispersed fruits were typically inconspicuous shades of green-yellow or dull red-brown, whereas fruits eaten by birds were generally bright orange to red. Dietary overlap between bats and nonflying mammals was relatively high. In contrast to primates and squirrels, which were major seed predators for several of the plant species under investigation, fruit bats had no negative impact on seed viability. A botanical survey in I ha of old-growth forest revealed that 13.7 percent of trees (greater than or equal to15 cm girth at breast height) were at least partially dependent upon fruit bats for pollination and/or seed dispersal.

AB We used null model analyses to investigate the existence of structure in lizard assemblages from open vegetation enclaves in Rond (o) over cap nia, southwestern Amazonia, in relation to species richness, species co-occurrence, diet, and size overlap. These enclaves presumably have been isolated since the Holocene, providing a history of long-term isolation. We assumed that the presence of structure in lizard assemblages from the Rond ($) over cap onia enclaves is consistent with the notion that extinctions are a deterministic process, some species being more prone to extinction than others. We grouped enclaves into four categories: latosoil cerrado, sandy cerrado, transitional forest, and rocky field. We collected 14 Cerrado lizard species, consisting of five families in all sampled areas. Analyses of species richness, co-occurrence, diet overlap, and size overlap patterns suggested lack of organization in the assemblages. The assemblages from the rocky fields of Guajara-Mirim and the sandy cerrados in Vilhena were significantly structured in diet overlap, whereas the remaining assemblages lacked structure. This probably resulted from phylogenetic inertia and not from ecological interactions. Our results suggest that extinctions proceeded in a stochastic fashion and that historical factors had a dominant role in shaping lizard assemblages in detriment of present-day ecological factors. In addition, we identified endemic species in the enclaves as well as a tight association between unique ecogeographic features of the landscape and species occurrences. We propose that conservation measures in the region must adequately preserve these features to ensure the survival of the species.

AB Edge creation has a pronounced influence on the understory vegetation, but the effects of edges on seedling species recruitment are still poorly understood. In Central Amazonia, 9-19 years after fragmentation, we recorded species richness and net seedling recruitment rate in I ha blocks exposed to none, one, or multiple edges within forest fragments. One-hectare blocks were located in the center (no edge), the edge (one edge), the corners (two edges) of 10 and 100 ha fragments, and in a I ha fragment (four edges). In 1991, we counted all tree seedlings 5-100 cm tall found within permanent 1 m(2) plots located within the I ha blocks. In May 1993, we manually removed all seedlings that were smaller than I in tall from the permanent plots. Six years and five months later (October 1999), all new seedlings recruited into the plots were counted and classified into distinct morphospecies. Species richness of recruited seedlings, scaled by total seedling density, declined from the center to the edge, the corner blocks, and then to the I ha fragment. Overall, the four-edged, I ha fragment had the poorest species richness and the non-edged 100 ha central block the highest. The total number of recruited individuals was 40 percent less than that previously present, with the 100 ha corner having the lowest recruitment. Pairwise comparisons showed that species similarity was related to edge number for the 100 and I ha fragments. Species rank/abundance curves showed that a subset of species was common in all blocks within the fragments, and that the 100 ha center held more rare species than any other I ha block. This study demonstrated that, in a given fragment patch, the number of tree seedling species recruited varied inversely with the number of edges.

Although ecophysiological factors were previously thought to dictate the distribution of these species at this site, we suggest that their current distribution is probably related to colonization history and subsequent competition for space.

AB Female Heliconius hewitsoni butterflies were found to aggregate during oviposition, producing multi-parent egg clutches. This behavior occurred when host plants were locally plentiful, indicating that females chose to oviposit gregariously. Collective clutch size correlated with host growth rate and with the number of females contributing to a clutch. Eggs did not positively bias host plant growth. Collective clutch size adjustment may represent a mechanism for facilitating larval aggregation while reducing intraspecific competition.

AB In an old-growth tropical wet forest at La Selva, Costa Rica, we combined radiocarbon (C-14) dating and tree-ring analysis to estimate the ages of large trees of canopy and emergent species spanning a broad range of wood densities and growth rates. We collected samples from the trunks, of 29 fallen, dead individuals. We found that all eight sampled species formed visible growth rings, which varied considerably in distinctiveness. For five of the six species for which we combined wood anatomical studies with C-14-dates (ring ages), the analyses demonstrated that growth rings were of annual formation. The oldest tree we found by direct ring counting was a Hymenolobium mesoamericanum Lima (Papilionaceae) specimen, with an age of ca. 530 years at the time of death. All other sampled individuals, including very large trees of slow-growing species, had died at ages between 200 and 300 years. These results show that, even in an everwet tropical rain forest, tree growth of many species can be rhythmic, with an annual periodicity. This study thus raises the possibility of extending tree-ring analyses throughout the tropical forest types lacking a strong dry season or annual flooding. Our findings and similar measurements from other tropical forests indicate that the maximum ages of tropical emergent trees are unlikely to be much greater than 600 years, and that these trees often die earlier from various natural causes.

AB I analyzed patterns of variation in root mass allocation and root morphology among seedlings of woody species in relation to environmental factors in four Neotropical forests. Among forests, I explored the response of root traits to sites varying in water or nutrient availability. Within each forest, I explored the plastic response of species to different microhabitats: gaps and understory. Additionally, I explored evidence for life history correlation of root and shoot traits by comparing species differing in their successional group (light-demanding [22 spp.] or shade tolerant [27 spp.]) and germination type (species with photosynthetic cotyledons or species with reserve cotyledons). At each forest site, young seedlings from 10 to 20 species were excavated. A total of 55 species was collected in understory conditions and 31 of them were also collected in gaps. From each seedling, six morphological ratios were determined. Allocation to roots was higher in forest sites with the lowest soil resources. Roots were finer and longer in the most infertile site, while roots were deeper in the site with the longest dry season. Seedling traits did not differ between germination types. Shade tolerant species allocated more to roots and developed thicker roots than light-demanding species. Light-demanding species showed stronger plastic responses to habitat than shade tolerant species, and species with photosynthetic cotyledons showed lower plasticity than species with reserve cotyledons. Overall, these results suggest that among Neotropical species, root allocation and root morphology of seedlings reflect plant adjustments to water or nutrient availability at geographic and microhabitat scales. In addition, life history specialization to light environments is suggested by differences among groups of species in their allocation to roots and in their root morphology.

ID FIG TREE; DNA; SPECIFICITY; INDONESIA; PLANTS
AB Natural hybrids between Ficus septica and two closely related dioecious species, F. fistulosa and F. hispida, were confirmed using amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP) and chloroplast DNA markers. Ficus species have a highly species-specific pollination mutualism with agaonid wasps. Therefore, the identification of cases in which breakdown in this sophisticated system occurs and the circumstances under which it happens is of interest. Various studies have confirmed that Ficus species are able to hybridize and that pollinator-specificity breakdown can occur under certain conditions. This study is the first example in which hybrid identity and the presence of hybrids in the natural distribution of parental species for Ficus have been confirmed with molecular markers. Hybrid individuals were identified on three island locations in the Sunda Strait region of Indonesia. These findings support Janzen's (1979) hypothesis that breakdown in pollinator specificity is more likely to occur on islands. We hypothesized that hybrid events could occur when the population size of pollinator wasps was small or had been small in one of the parental species. Later generation hybrids were identified, indicating that backcrossing and introgression did occur to some extent and that therefore, hybrids could be fertile. The small number of hybrids found indicated that there was little effect of hybridization on parental species integrity over the study area. Although hybrid individuals were not common, their presence at multiple sites indicated that the hybridization events reported here were not isolated incidences. Chloroplast DNA haplotypes of hybrids were not derived solely from one species, suggesting that the seed donor was not of the same parental species in all hybridization events.

AB Pollinator visual systems differ considerably among broad groupings such as bees, bats, and birds, and it has been proposed that factors shaping the diversity of flower color in tropical plants include differences in pollinator perceptual abilities. Within the pollinators of the Neotropics, one major difference between taxa is that hummingbirds perceive color well across a broad range of wavelengths from 300-660 nm whereas most bees perceive color well over a narrower range spanning 300-550 nm. Thus, hummingbirds can see red and other long-wavelength reflection much better than bees. Another factor that could potentially influence flower color in tropical forests is the difference in light availability among habitats such as gaps, canopy, and forest understory. I conducted a survey of floral color in four Neotropical forests using a portable spectroradiometer to provide an unbiased measure of color reflectance. The primary pollinator agents and light habitats of each plant species were classified using primary literature or accounts of direct observations by experts. Flower color was not influenced by differences in light availability between open and closed habitats but was influenced by pollinator visual systems. Specifically, insect flowers reflected across a broad range of the spectrum but hummingbird flowers reflected mostly long-wavelength light (typically median wavelength >585 nm). Thus, hummingbird-pollinated flowers are not tuned specifically to hummingbird color sensitivity but instead may decrease conspicuousness to bees and other insects that have poor visual sensitivity to long-wavelength color.

AB The selective advantage of Mullerian mimicry in nature was investigated by releasing live mimetic and nonmimetic butterflies close to wild, aerial-hunting tropical kingbirds (Tyrannus melancholicus) and cliff-flycatchers (Hirundinea ferruginea) in three Amazon habitats (rain forest, a city, and "canga" vegetation). Only mimetic butterflies elicited sight-rejections by birds, but protection conferred by mimicry was restricted to sites in which both predators and mimics co-occurred, as in the case of six mimicry rings at a forest site and two at a city site. Most other Mullerian mimics released at city and canga vegetation were heavily attacked and consumed by birds. These results appear to reflect the birds' previous experiences with resident butterfly faunas and illustrate how birds' discriminatory behavior varied among habitats that differed in butterfly species and mimicry ring composition.

AB The effect of the fossorial land crab Gecarcinus quadratus (Gecarcinidae) on patterns of accumulation and distribution of leaf litter was studied for two years in the coastal primary forests of Costa Rica's Corcovado National Park. Within this mainland forest, G. quadratus achieve densities up to 6 crabs/m(2) in populations extending along the Park's Pacific coastline and inland for ca 600 m. Crabs selectively forage for fallen leaf litter and relocate what they collect to burrow chambers that extend from 15 to 150 cm deep (N = 44), averaging (+/- SE) 48.9 +/- 3.0 cm. Preference trials suggested that leaf choice by crabs may be species-specific. Excavated crab burrows revealed maximum leaf collections of 11.75 g dry mass-2.5 times more leaf litter than collected by square-meter leaf fall traps over several seven-day sampling periods. Additionally, experimental crab exclosures (25 m(2)) were established using a repeated measures randomized block design to test for changes in leaf litter as a function of reduced crab density. Exclosures accumulated significantly more (5.6 +/- 3.9 times) leaf litter than did control treatments during the wet, but not the dry, seasons over this two-year study. Such extensive litter relocation by land crabs may affect profiles of soil organic carbon, rooting, and seedling distributions.

AB We examined genetic diversity of howler monkeys (Alouatta palliata) from Costa Rica. Blood samples of howler monkeys were collected at various locations in Costa Rica, and electrophoresis of total plasma proteins yielded no variation. We also conducted starch gel electrophoresis of red cell isozymes and did not find variation for any of the 14 loci analyzed (i.e., ACP, ADA, CA2, EST, GPI, IDH, LDH-1, LDH-2, MDH, PGD, PGM-1, PGM-2, SOD, and TPI). These findings were compared with the levels of genetic variation for A. seniculus and A. belzebul from one Brazilian population. Four of the 14 isozymes (ADA, GPI, PGD, and SOD) showed more than one allele for these species. Both A. seniculus and A. belzebul from Brazil showed similar levels of genetic variation. The potential causes of the low genetic variation in A. palliata from Costa Rica are discussed.

AB Given current accelerated trends of tropical land conversion, forest fragments are being incorporated into many conservation programs. For investing in fragments to be a viable conservation strategy, forest fragments must maintain their ecological integrity over the long term. Based on fieldwork in 22 forest fragments in the crater lakes region of western Uganda and in the continuous forest of Kibale National Park, we examined (1) seed predation on experimentally dispersed seeds, (2) abundance and composition of the dung beetle community that may play a major role in removing seeds from sites of high seed predation, and (3) compared the fragments' seedling community composition to adult tree community composition and the seedling community in continuous forest. First, the rate of seed removal at experimental stations was lower in forest fragments (85% remaining after 1 day) than at stations in the continuous forest (79% remaining) and the probability of stations being discovered by seed predators was lower in fragments (23%) than in the intact forest (41%). Second, there was a 62 percent decline in fragment dung beetle abundance. The magnitude of this decline varied among dung beetle guilds that process dung and seeds in different fashions. The abundance of large rollers that move large seeds away from sites of defecation did not differ, but medium and smaller rollers and burying beetles that process small and medium-sized seeds were less common in the fragments than in the intact forest. Finally, we compared the seedling community composition relative to adult tree community composition by identifying all adult trees in each fragment and by sampling the composition of the seedling community. We found some evidence to suggest that there was movement of seeds among forest fragments by large-bodied dispersers, particularly chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and hornbills (Ceratogymna subcylindricus).

AB Habitat fragmentation and the widespread creation of habitat edges have recently stimulated interest in assessing the effects of ecotones on biodiversity. Ecotones, natural or anthropogenic, can greatly affect faunal movement, population dynamics, species interactions, and community structure. Few data exist, however, on insect community response to forest-savanna ecotones, a natural analog to anthropogenically cleared areas adjacent to forest. In this study, the abundance, total biomass, average individual biomass, and distribution of scarabaeine dung beetles were examined at a sharp tropical evergreen forest-savanna ecotone in Santa Cruz, Bolivia. The abundance, total biomass, and average individual biomass of dung beetles varied significantly across the forest, edge, and savanna habitats. Species richness (S(obs)) also varied significantly across the three habitats, but statistical estimations of true species richness (S(est)) did not. Habitat specificity of the dung beetles in this study was extremely high. Of the 50 most common species collected during the study, only 2 species were collected in both the forest and savanna habitats, signaling nearly complete community turnover in just a few meters. Strong edge effects were evidenced by the decline in abundance, total biomass, and species richness at the forest-savanna boundary.

AB As tropical forest fragmentation accelerates, scientists are concerned with the loss of species, particularly those that play important ecological roles. Because bats play a vital role as the primary seed dispersers in cleared areas, maintaining healthy bat populations is critical to natural forest regeneration. Observations of foraging bats suggest that many Neotropical fruit-eating species have fairly general habitat requirements and can forage in many different kinds of disturbed vegetation; however, their roosting requirements may be quite different. To test whether or not general foraging requirements are matched by equally broad roosting requirements, we used radiotelemetry to locate roost sites of two common frugivorous bat species (Sturnira lilium and Artibeus intermedius) in a fragmented forest in southeastern Mexico. Sturnira lilium roosted inside tree cavities and selected large-diameter roost trees in remnant patches of mature forest. Fewer than 2 percent of trees surveyed had a mean diameter equal to or greater than roost trees used by S. lilium. Artibeus intermedius roosted externally on branches and vines and under palm leaves and selected roost trees of much smaller diameter. Compared to random trees, roost trees chosen by A. intermedius were closer to neighboring taller trees and also closer in height to these trees. Such trees likely provide cryptic roosts beneath multiple overlapping crowns, with sufficient shelter from predators and the elements. While males of A. intermedius generally roosted alone in small trees within secondary forest, females roosted in small groups in larger trees within mature forest and commuted more than three times farther than males to reach their roost sites. Loss of mature forest could impair the ability of frugivorous bats to locate suitable roost sites. This could have a negative impact on bat populations, which in turn could decrease forest regeneration in impacted areas.

AB The relative importance of cotyledons and leaves for seedling survival was evaluated using a factorial field experiment on three neotropical tree species with contrasting cotyledon functional morphologies (photosynthetic, epigeal reserve vs. hypogeal reserve). In all species, cotyledon and leaf removal shortly after leaf expansion had additive negative effects on seedling survival over 7 weeks. Carbon supplies from cotyledons and other carbohydrate reserves apparently enhanced ability of seedlings to cope with herbivory and disease.

AB Radiocarbon dating and Ar-40/Ar-39 analysis of overlying tephra indicate that plant fossil assemblages exposed by stream erosion and well construction in and near La Selva Biological Station in eastern lowland Costa Rica are Pleistocene in age. We identified plant taxa based on wood, leaves, fruits, seeds, pollen, and spores examined from three sites at ca 30 m elevation. Extrapolating from modern ranges and surface temperature lapse rates suggests paleotemperatures 2.5-3.1 degreesC cooler than at present.

AB Satellite multi- and hyper-spectral sensors have evolved over the past three decades into powerful monitoring tools for ecosystem processes. Research in temperate environments, however, has tended to keep pace with new remote sensing technologies more so than in tropical environments. Here, we identify what we consider to be three priority areas for remote sensing research in Neotropical dry forests. The first priority is the use of improved sensor capabilities, which should allow for better characterization of tropical secondary forests than has been achieved. Secondary forests are of key interest due to their potential for sequestering carbon in relatively short periods of time. The second priority is the need to characterize leaf area index (LAI) and other biophysical variables by means of bidirectional reflectance function models. These biophysical parameters have importance linkages with net primary productivity and may be estimated through remote sensing. The third priority is to identify tree species using hyper-spectral imagery, which represents an entirely new area of research for tropical forests that could have powerful applications in biodiversity conservation.

AB The fine root systems of three tropical montane forests differing in age and history were investigated in the Cordillera Talamanca, Costa Rica. We analyzed abundance, vertical distribution, and morphology of fine roots in an early successional forest (10-15 years old, FSF), a mid-successional forest (40 years old, MSF), and a nearby undisturbed old-growth forest (OGF), and related the root data to soil morphological and chemical parameters. The OGF stand contained a 19 cm deep organic layer on the forest floor (i.e., 530 mol C/m(2)) which was two and five times thicker than that of the MSF (10 cm) and ESF stands (4 cm), respectively. There was a corresponding decrease in fine root biomass in this horizon from 1128 g dry matter/m(2) in the old-growth forest to 337 (MSF) and 31 g/m(2) (ESF) in the secondary forests, although the stands had similar leaf areas. The organic layer was a preferred substrate for fine root growth in the old-growth forest as indicated by more than four times higher fine root densities (root mass per soil volume) than in the mineral topsoil (0-10 cm); in the two secondary forests, root densities in the organic layer were equal to or lower than in the mineral soil. Specific fine root surface areas and specific root tip abundance (tips per unit root dry mass) were significantly greater in the roots of the ESF than the MSF and OGF stands. Most roots of the ESF trees (8 abundant species) were infected by VA mycorrhizal fungi; ectomycorrhizal species (Quercus copeyensis and Q. costaricensis) were dominant in the MSF and OGF stands. Replacement of tropical montane oak forest by secondary forest in Costa Rica has resulted in (1) a large reduction of tree fine root biomass; (2) a substantial decrease in depth of the organic layer (and thus in preferred rooting space); and (3) a great loss of soil carbon and nutrients. Whether old-growth Quercus forests maintain a very high fine root biomass because their ectomycorrhizal rootlets are less effective in nutrient absorption than those of VA mycorrhizal secondary forests, or if their nutrient demand is much higher than that of secondary forests (despite a similar leaf area and leaf mass production), remains unclear.

AB Floristic composition and vegetation structure of plants 3 cm stem diameter or greater were compared at four sites in the Agreste of Paraiba, Brazil: (1) little disturbed for five decades (LD); (2) grazed fragment, selectively logged 16 years before sampling (GF); (3) naturally regrowing for 30 years after 39 years of agriculture (OR); and (4) naturally regrowing for 20 years after 35 years of agriculture plus 15 years of pasture (NR). Cattle graze frequently in the last three sites but very seldom in LD. The little disturbed site had more species (53) than the other three sites (36, 25, and I I species in GF, OG, and NG, respectively) and also more (3253, 2780, 2780, and 2115 plants/ha) and larger plants (34.8, 26.8, 18.6, and 7.8 m(2)/ha), including taller tree species (up to 15 m) absent in the other sites (maximum height: 14, 6, and 5 m). Differences were striking in relation to NR, the site with longer use and shorter regrowth period, which was strongly dominated by only two species: Mimosa tenuiflora (73% relative density and 81% basal area) and Piptadenia stipulacea (21% relative density and 16% basal area). These results indicate that abandoned agricultural sites may take several decades to reestablish vegetation similar to the original.

AB It has been suggested that the average canopy height of Madagascar's lowland rain forests is shorter and the average tree density is greater than in other tropical lowland rain forests of the world. The cause was hypothesized to be frequent cyclone disturbances. We compared the structure of the lowland rain forests in Madagascar to the structure described in published accounts of other tropical lowland rain forests. We found that the eastern coastal lowland forests of Madagascar have short canopy heights relative to that of many other lowland tropical rain forests, and that these Malagasy forests also have relatively high tree densities. On a worldwide basis, there is a significant correlation between short forest canopies and occurrence of tropical cyclones. The association between high tree density and occurrence of tropical cyclones is valid for Africa, but the pattern does not hold up globally.

AB The genus Tococa is comprised of 47 species of small trees and shrubs distributed from southern Mexico to Bolivia. About 30 of the species have ant domatia that develop at the base of the leaf blade or at the apex of the petiole. Ant exclusion experiments on three different species of Tococa occupying different environments were carried out to assess their effect in protecting the plant against herbivores. Additionally, ant behavior was monitored in control plants to study how they might be conferring protection against herbivory. Herbivory was significantly lower on control plants (ants maintained) than on experimental plants (ants removed), demonstrating the role of the ants as defenses against herbivores. Herbivory rates in open and disturbed areas were higher than in the forest understory. Ant exclusion experiments showed that both timid and aggressive ants protect their host plants against potential herbivores by killing or warding off scouts of leaf-cutter ants (Atta sp.) and removing the eggs of Lepidoptera and Coleoptera from the surface of the plants.

AB Environmental fluctuations can play an important role in shaping demographic processes in plant and animal populations. On Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama, El Ni (n) over tildeo Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events followed by mild dry seasons have been shown to stimulate variation in community-wide fruit production. This variation has been postulated to lead to famine in frugivore and granivore populations, but few if any studies have assessed further implications for other members of the ecological community. This study examined the ways in which variation in fruit production associated with an El Ni (n) over tildeo event on BCI may influence demographic and evolutionary traits in a plant species that is only consumed by frugivores during periods of fruit scarcity. Specifically, I assessed the effects of herbivory by collared peccaries (Tayassu tajacu) on demographic Fates and patterns in the terrestrial bromeliad, Aechmea magdalenae. Aechmea magdalenae usually suffers little or no herbivory, and rain forest collared peccaries, which are primarily frugivorous, have not previously been reported to eat this species. Rates of survival and reproduction of 296 A. magdalenae rosettes in three transects of differing densities were recorded from 1997 through 1999. Mortality rates due to herbivory increased significantly from 1997 to 1999 and showed a close correspondence with enhanced and then decreased rates of community-wide fruit production associated with the 1997 ENSO. The densest portions of the A. magdalenae population showed lower mortality rates and higher rates of reproduction than did the less dense regions. Over the study period, A. magdalenae populations decreased by 45 percent. The implications of periodic herbivory by hungry frugivores are discussed with respect to population regulation, seedling dispersal, and evolution of A. magdalenae dense growth habit.

AB Most plant species in tropical forests are pollinated by animals, and yet the diversity and specificity of pollinator assemblages are poorly documented. Here, we investigated pollinator relationships for 11 species of understory herbs in the genus Costus, with the goal of documenting visitation rates and pollinator assemblages among a variety of habitats. For a subset of species, we documented pollinator visitation for multiple years and/or multiple sites to examine temporal and spatial variation in pollinator relationships. Furthermore, we examined the extent to which specialization in pollination systems can contribute to reproductive isolation for sympatric species. Each species was primarily pollinated by either euglossine bees or hummingbirds. Total visitation rates were generally low, averaging 3.2 visits per flower per hour for bee-pollinated species and 0.5 visits per flower per hour for hummingbird-pollinated species. All of the higher elevation species studied were hummingbird-pollinated, while low elevation species were pollinated either by euglossine bees or hummingbirds. Spatial and temporal variation in visitation rates and pollinator identities was minimal. Pollinator specificity was found to contribute strongly to reproductive isolation for the 11 pairwise combinations of sympatric species differing in pollination syndrome, in some cases functioning as a complete barrier to potential pollen flow.

AB The diet and food resource partitioning of three sympatric hornbills (Great Hornbill Buceros bicornis, Wreathed Hornbill Aceros undulatus, and Oriental Pied Hornbill Anthracoceros albirostris) during the nonbreeding season were studied relative to fruit availability in a foothill semievergreen forest of Arunachal Pradesh, northeast India. Hornbills fed on fruits of 49 plant species that comprised over 95 percent of their diet. Hornbill species partitioned food resources by varying the relative contribution of figs and non-fig fruits in the diet. Similarity in non-fig fruit diet was low. Ten species contributed to over 90 percent of the non-fig diet. The availability of non-fig fruits was much lower in the nonbreeding season than in the breeding season; however, despite lower fruit availability during the nonbreeding season, hornbills had a wide diet breadth and indirect evidence suggests that Wreathed Hornbills foraged widely in this season for fruit. Great Hornbills relied more on figs that were available year-round. The diverse diet breadth that included rare and patchy fruit resources underscores the importance of conserving large forest tracts for hornbills.

AB We studied patterns of removal and predation on seeds of ten plant species over two years in four abandoned pastures adjacent to forest fragments in Costa Rica. We hypothesized that: (1) removal within pastures would be greater nearest forest fragments and decline at farther distances; (2) removal rates would be greater on smaller-seeded species; and (3) removal rates would differ among pastures. We placed seeds of two species in three pastures in 1997 and eight species in two pastures during 1998. In each pasture, removal was monitored at three distances from the forest edge. Rates of seed removal in 1997 and 1998 were significantly greater 1-5 in from the forest than at 20 in distances, but removal rates at the 40 in distance did not differ from the 1-5 in distance. Rates of removal for both species were low in 1997, although removal was significantly greater for the smaller-seeded species Sorocea trophoides than for the large seeds of Nectandra sp. Removal rates differed significantly among pastures for both species in 1997 and among pastures for five small-seeded species in 1998. No removal of three large-seeded species was detected in 1998. Interspecific differences in seed removal rates were consistent with the hypothesis that larger seeds are removed less in pastures than smaller seeds. While some seed removal patterns appear predictable, species-specific variation in removal within and among sites was substantial. Predator population densities and other among-pasture differences may also influence patterns of spatial variation in seed predation.

AB To determine the spatial dynamics of Neotropical lotic insect species, specimens were collected from 41 streams on the eastern and western flanks of the Andes Mountains in Ecuador. We examined the manner in which taxonomic richness and composition differed with elevation, latitude, and versant. Statistical analyses were limited to 5 families (Ephemeroptera: Baetidae, Leptohyphidae, Oligoneuriidae; Heteroptera: Naucoridae; Coleoptera: Elmidae), comprising 32 genera and 85 species, for which identifications or morphospecies assignments were reliable. Assessment of taxonomic diversity was based on the richness of genera and species at each site. In addition, each site was characterized by species richness within each of 4 families with more than 10 species. The effects of versant and transect on composition and structure were family-specific. Mean site differences between versants in elmid richness at generic and specific levels depended on transect. Only baetid richness was affected by versant and transect in a consistent manner. Variation among sites in composition based on all genera and species was captured using multidimensional scaling (MDS). Subsequent MANOVAs based on scores from MDS axes revealed that differences between versants were much stronger in the southern transect, although transects differed from each other at specific and generic levels. A Jaccard's similarity matrix was computed for each family to reflect the spatial organization of taxonomic composition. Mesogeographic patterns of species composition for each of the four families were correlated (Mantel analysis) at both the regional level and at the level of the entire study area. At the regional level, the only pair of families to exhibit correlated patterns of species composition was elmids and naucorids in the southwestern region. The pattern of species composition for each family was correlated with the patterns for one or more other families at the level of the entire study area. Thus, spatial dynamics of species composition was similar for the families examined, suggesting that the Andes exert a consistent influence on species distributions within families, regardless of ordinal affiliation. At a local scale, however, the way in which taxonomic composition changed with latitude and versant was family-specific. Mayflies, the most vagile of the taxa studied, had the highest percentage of species overlap between versants. Of three genera of Naucoridae collected, species of Ambrysus, of probable Mexican origin, were found only on the eastern versant, corroborating other evidence that the genus is recent in South America. Moreover, dispersion by Ambrysus across the Andes Mountains may not have occurred, as it has for Cryphocricos and Limnocoris, which are of probable South American origin.

AB We studied growth and demography in a population of Xenosaurus newmanorum a lizard that lives in rock crevices in the tropical cloud forests of Mexico. Growth rates varied with season (faster in the wet season) and year (faster in 1995 and 1997, slower in 1996 and 1999). Males and females did not differ in growth rate. Proportion of reproductive females varied from year to year, with 1996 having the lowest proportion of reproductive females (32.5%) compared to the other years (all >75%). The age/size structure changed slightly among years, but did not differ between the wet and dry seasons. On average, the sex ratio was female-biased; however, the proportion of males in the population was greater in the dry season than in the wet season. Our results suggest that, like other lizards, growth and demographic characteristics of this population fluctuate with the proximate environment on both a seasonal and annual timescale.

AB Biannual cycles of reproduction and molt are rare in birds, with most species exhibiting a single annual cycle. We studied the breeding and molting phenology of the Cinnamon-bellied Flowerpiercer (Diglossa baritula), a nectar feeding passerine, in western Mexico. Monthly captures from December 1994 to May 1998 revealed clear biannual breeding and molting cycles. The two breeding seasons took place from January to April (dry season) and from July to October (rainy season). Their July to October breeding season coincided with the single breeding season exhibited by resident hummingbirds at our study site. Even though flowerpiercers and hummingbirds use the same food resources, hummingbirds only molt and breed once a year. Male flowerpiercers breed and molt flight feathers twice a year, whereas females appear to breed only once. A higher proportion of females bred in the rainy season (90%) than in the dry season (30%), and they underwent a complete molt only during the rainy season. Proportions of males in breeding condition during the dry and the rainy season were similar (86 and 92%). Some males (40%) showed an incomplete molt in the dry season, while most males (80%) underwent a complete molt in the rainy season. Differences in proportions of breeding and molting individuals between the dry and the rainy season suggest that the dry season cycle is limited by food availability. We hypothesize that D. baritula individuals use soft fruits in addition to flowers to fuel their breeding during the dry season.

AB In spite of the important role played by bats in tropical ecosystems, little is known about how they are affected by habitat fragmentation. By using a mark/recapture protocol and radiotelemetry techniques in a naturally fragmented landscape composed of primary forests and forest fragments surrounded by savannas in Alter do Ch (a) over tildeo, Pari State, Brazil, we were able to track the movements of various species of bats, calculate the size of the area used, locate roosts and potential feeding areas, and determine preferred flight routes. We marked 3440 bats belonging to 44 species and recaptured 151 belonging to 14 species. The average distance between extra-site recaptures was 2.2 km. With the exception of bats marked in fragments and recaptured in forests, all other possible inter-habitat recaptures were observed. We selected 23 bats of 8 species for radiotelemetry and the areas used by them varied from 65 to 530 ha. Some species restricted their activity to the vicinity of their roosts, rarely moving more than 500 m away, but others traveled greater distances between roosts and foraging areas. All tracked bats flew over savannas, crossing distances from 0.5 to 2.5 km. Roost location and type varied among species, from individuals roosting alone in the foliage to colonies in buildings. Bats were highly mobile and savannas did not appear to inhibit the movements of some species, suggesting that a persistent biological flow may be maintained among isolated fragments, with bats acting as pollinators and seed dispersers.

AB Species lists are sources of information for studies of both conservation and macroecology. It is, however, important to differentiate between relatively complete lists and extremely incomplete ones. The aim of this study was to evaluate how sampling effort typically used in inventories affects the number of bat species captured in areas of Atlantic Forest in southeastern Brazil. We also evaluated if the number of sampled sites, size of the sampled area, and sampling effort (net hours) affect species richness. We used previously reported data from studies in Rio de Janeiro, S (a) over tildeo Paulo, and Minas Gerais States, and our own data collected during 1989 and 2001. Nonlinear models fit well the data for Rio de Janeiro and Minas Gerais States and all states together, but not for S (a) over tildeo Paulo State. Genera richness showed a similar pattern to that of species richness. The model used to explain the relationship between species richness and size of the study area, number of sites, and sampling effort sampled was significant. The number of sites sampled explained a significant part of the variation observed; however, other variables contributed nothing to the model, suggesting that capturing beta diversity is the most important aspect of biodiversity surveys for bats, and that increasing net hours at a given location is much more inefficient than distributing net hours across locations. We suggest 1000 captures as the minimum necessary when sampling with mist nets to capture the majority of phyllostomid species for a given site (alpha diversity). In addition, we suggest that shifting the position of the mist nets between nights will increase the probability of capturing more species.

AB Armases angustipes (Grapsidae) crabs were recorded on 31.5 percent of Aechmea pectinata inflorescences, a common ornithofilous bromeliad in rain forests of southeastern Brazil. Crabs foraged mainly in the morning and used newly opened flowers, usually damaging the corolla, consuming the stamens and stigma, and interfering with hummingbird visits. This florivory may reduce the reproductive success of A. pectinata, both directly through consumption of flowers and indirectly by reducing pollinator visits.

AB We used the Hedley sequential extraction procedure to measure nine different organic and inorganic soil phosphorus fractions in forest soils of the Bragantina region of Para, Brazil. We compared the labile fractions (resin-extractable P + HCO3-extractable inorganic and organic P) in Oxisols from three secondary forests (10, 20, and 40 years old) and a primary forest. These stands were located in an area that has supported shifting agriculture for approximately a century After agricultural use, total P and labile P in soils of young secondary forests are diminished compared to the amounts present in the primary forest soil. Within each stand, organic carbon content was a good predictor of labile organic and inorganic P, consistent with the large body of research indicating that mineralization of organic matter is important to plant nutrition in tropical ecosystems. During the reorganization of P pools during forest development, the pool of labile organic P (HCO3-extractable) diminishes more than the other labile fractions, suggesting that it is directly or indirectly an important source of P for the regrowing forest vegetation. Across the four age classes of forest, the soil reservoir of labile P was equal to or greater than the total amount of P in the vegetation. If labile P measured by this method adequately represents P available to plants in the short term (as suggested by the current consensus), we would conclude that plant-available P is reasonably abundant, and that the effects of agriculture on available P pools are detectable but not sufficient to compromise forest regrowth in this area.

AB We determined rates of acetylene reduction and estimated total nitrogen fixation associated with bryophytes, lichens, and decaying wood in Hawaiian montane rain forest sites with underlying substrate ranging in age from 300 to 4.1 million years. Potential N fixation ranged from ca 0.2 kg/ha annually in the 300-year-old site to ca 1 kg/ha annually in the 150,000-year-old site. Rates of acetylene reduction were surprisingly uniform along the soil-age gradient, except for high rates in symbiotic/associative fixers at the 150,000-year-old site-and in heterotrophic fixers at the 2100-year-old site. Low fixation at the youngest site, where plant production is known to be N-limited, suggests that demand for N alone does not govern N fixation. Total N fixation was highest in sites with low N:P ratios in leaves and stem wood, perhaps because epiphytic bryophytes and lichens depend on canopy leachate for mineral nutrients and because heterotrophic fixation is partly controlled by nutrient supply in the decomposing substrate; however, differences in substrate cover, rather than in fixation rates, had the largest effect on the total N input from fixation at these sites.

AB The goal of this study was to define differences in species richness and tree and liana species assemblages of three adjacent terra firme forests in the middle Rio Caqueta, Colombia. A vegetation survey of trees and lianas equal to or more than 10 cm diameter at breast height (DBH) was carried out along a single longitudinal transect (10 x 2160 in) passing through a low plain terrace, a high dissected terrace, and a high plain terrace. Species were classified as either locally abundant or locally rare. Abundant species were defined as "generalists" (in all environments), "intermediate" (in two environments), and "specialists" (in only one environment) using a 2 x 3 contingency table. There were 146 (39%) species classified as locally abundant and 231 (61%) as locally rare. Among the abundant species, 70 percent were generalists, 25 percent were specialists, and 5 percent were intermediate. Although there was a significant number of rare species, for those species with sufficient numbers to statistically test spatial distribution, the results suggest that many species are generalists and that beta diversity at the local scale (2.16 ha) is low. Larger data sets over larger geographical areas should be analyzed to determine the degree of species turnover in Amazonian forests.

AB In the tropical montane cloud forest of Veracruz, Mexico, most canopy trees are deciduous, whereas the understory is composed of small broadleaved evergreen trees and shrubs. In this study, I tested the hypotheses that (1) leafing and flowering in the understory occur when the canopy is most open; and (2) a shift in phenological patterns occurs in plants growing at the forest edge. In two microhabitats (interior and edge) at each of three study sites, foliar and reproductive phenologies were recorded in five shrub species (Eugenia xalapensis, Miconia glaberrima, Moussonia deppeana, Ocotea psychotrioides, and Palicourea padifolia), and canopy openness and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) were measured monthly for 36 months. Canopy openness was greatest from November through February; however, PAR was highest during January-March. Leaf drop of the shrubs was continuous during the year. Leafing occurred throughout the year for Miconia, Moussonia, and Talicourea; leafing coincided with maximum PAR for Ocotea, but occurred during March-April for Eugenia. Flowering peaked from December to May, but Miconia, Moussonia, and Ocotea peaks coincided with levels of maximal PAR and were displaced by one month with respect to maximal canopy openness; the Palicourea flowering peak was negatively correlated with canopy openness. Fruiting was extended from March to October, coinciding with tree canopy fruiting. The results indicated that leafing and flowering in the understory started earlier than in the forest canopy. Leafing and flowering were synchronous in the interior and forest edge, but there was a weak trend for reduced peaks at the edge. The hypotheses were not supported: phenological patterns were temporally displaced between forest strata, but only three shrub species produced leaves and flowers during maximum PAR in the understory; there were no differences in phenological patterns between forest interior and edge.

AB Epiphytes perform critical functions in primary tropical forests, but their ecological roles have only rarely been studied in secondary forests or in forest plantations. We assessed the composition and distribution of epiphytic bromeliad communities in four- and eight-year-old replicated experimental monospecific tree plantations (3 species) at the La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. The bromeliad communities of these stands are dominated by two species, Guzmania monostachya (L.) Rusby ex. Mez and Vriesea gladioliflora (H. Wendl.) Antoine. We identified bromeliads on over 700 trees and estimated their biomass and leaf area. Mean bromeliad biomass ranged from 2 to 8 g/tree in the four-year-old plots and from 20 to 94 g/tree in the eight-year-old plots. The mean bromeliad leaf area ranged between 104 and 704 cm(2)/tree and from 1600 to 8500 cm(2)/tree in the four- and eight-year-old plots, respectively. Although bromeliads accounted for less than 2 percent of the total foliar biomass and leaf area in both four-year-old and eight-year-old plots, the biomass of bromeliads exhibited a 5- to 46-fold increase between the four-year-old and eight-year-old plots, respectively. Bromeliads showed clear patterns of host tree preference, which may be attributed to host tree characteristics that differentially favor recruitment and survivorship. Between four and eight years of growth, differences among host tree species with respect to the amount of available host tree woody biomass, host tree foliar biomass, and host tree leaf surface area were positively correlated with the abundance of epiphytic bromeliads.

ID BOLIVIA
AB We studied the occurrence of epiphytic ferns on the lower trunks of two kinds of hosts: tree ferns and angiosperms. The study was conducted in Costa Rica at the La Selva Biological Field Station (50 m elev.), Las Cruces Biological Field Station (1200 m), Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve (1500 m), and Cuerici Biological Field Station (2600 m). At each site, 20 tree fern trunks with a root mantle were sampled for epiphytes up to a height of 3 m, and the same was done for the nearest angiosperm trunk of similar diameter at breast height (DBH). A total of 106 species of epiphytic ferns was found at all of the study sites; none occurred more frequently on angiosperm trunks, but 11 occurred more frequently on tree ferns. Seven of the 11 species were entirely restricted to tree ferns, whereas the other 4 also occurred on angiosperms. Tree ferns had a significantly higher number of epiphytic species than angiosperms, averaging (depending on the site) 3-5 species, whereas angiosperms averaged 1 or 2. Epiphytic ferns were more abundant on tree ferns than on angiosperms. No correlation existed, for tree ferns or for angiosperms, between DBH and species richness or percent cover of fern epiphytes. In conclusion, low-trunk fern epiphytes exhibited significant differences on tree fern versus angiosperm in regard to species composition, number of species per trunk, and percent cover. The differences probably were caused by the root mantles providing more favorable microhabitats for the establishment of fern prothalli and a better substrate for the attachment of fern sporophytes.

AB We conducted experimental manipulations and field observations to determine the role of members of a nectarivorous guild (pollinators and robbers) on nectar production and pollen deposition in Hamelia patens at the La Selva Biological Station (Costa Rica). Seven pollinators (hummingbirds) and four robbers (I hummingbird and 3 perching birds) comprised the avian nectarivorous guild visiting H. patens during March 1997. In addition, two florivorous birds were observed visiting H. patens during the study. Pollinators accounted for 85.6 percent of the visits, robbers for 12.4 percent, and florivores for 2 percent of the visits. Visitation by pollinators and robbers was greatest when floral nectar was highest. No aggressive interactions between pollinators and robbers were observed during the study. Pollinators differed in their ability to carry and deposit pollen on the stigma. Territorial hummingbirds were the least effective pollinators but the most frequent visitors. Flowers were frequently robbed (71%) during the study. Flowers experimentally robbed did not increase nectar production compared to control flowers; therefore, robbery may not involve an extra energy investment in terms of nectar production. The number of pollen grains deposited on artificially robbed flowers was significantly less than the number found in flowers with extra nectar (nectar added) but did not differ from the number found in non-manipulated flowers, indicating that nectar robbers may not affect the foraging behavior of hummingbirds, and therefore pollen deposition.

AB Foliar herbivory and abundance of folivorous insects were studied on shrub species (Miconia glaberrima, Moussonia deppeana, Ocotea psychotrioides, and Palicourea padifolia) in a tropical montane cloud forest, Veracruz, Mexico. Monthly, we determined folivore damage, insect abundance on leaves, and microenvironmental variables (air and soil temperatures, relative humidity, and soil water content). Folivory per month varied between 2.04 +/- 0.45 percent in April and 4.41 +/- 0.86 percent in September. The highest levels of folivory occurred during the end of the wet-warm season (Palicourea), the relatively dry-cool season (Miconia and Ocotea), or during both seasons (Moussonia). Eighty-eight percent of the herbivores were caterpillars (Lepidoptera). Insect abundance was lower in the dry-warm and the beginning of wet-warm seasons (April-July) and higher during the wet-warm and dry cool seasons. Leaf production was continuous throughout the year for Miconia, Moussonia, and Palicourea; Ocotea had a leafing peak during December-March (dry-cool). Folivory and insect abundance were negatively correlated with maximum temperature and positively correlated with soil water content. The correlations between folivory and leaf production were not significant for any of the studied species. Because leaves are produced throughout the year (except for Ocotea), insect abundance was not related to leaf flush. Also, folivory and insect abundance were not correlated (except for Palicourea). Thus, foliar phenology may not be an escape from herbivory, at least for the studied shrub species. Rather, environmental conditions may play an important role in insect abundance and indirectly affect foliar herbivory levels.

AB We radio-tracked five red-rumped agoutis (Dasyprocta leporina) for two to nine months each at the Esta do Ecologica Ilha de Maraca in the northern Brazilian Amazon. Agoutis fed primarily on seeds and pulp but also ate cotyledons, leaves, flowers, and invertebrates. Three plant species made up 63 percent of the feeding observations. Home range size varied from 3 to 8.5 ha. High-use areas and home range boundaries shifted from the season of high fruit availability to the season of low fruit availability as different individual trees became the focus of feeding activities. Agoutis foraged preferentially within conspecific patches of preferred fruit species and concentrated their feeding and scatterhoarding activities near individual fruiting trees. These results suggest that agoutis, as extremely short-distance seed dispersers, may contribute to the aggregated dispersion pattern of large-seeded tropical forest trees.

AB Tropical stream food webs are thought to be based primarily on terrestrial resources (leaf litter) in small forested headwater streams and algal resources in larger, wider streams. In tropical island streams, the dominant consumers are often omnivorous freshwater shrimps that consume algae, leaf litter, insects, and other shrimps. We used stable isotope analysis to examine (1) the relative importance of terrestrial and algal-based food resources to shrimps and other consumers and determine (2) if the relative importance of these food resources changed along the stream continuum. We examined delta(15)N and delta(13)C signatures of leaves, algae, macrophyles, biofilm, insects, snails, fishes, and shrimps at three sites (300, 90, and 10 In elev.) along the Rio Espiritu Santo, which drains the Caribbean National Forest, Puerto Rico. Isotope signatures of basal resources were distinct at all sites. Results of two-source delta(13)C mixing models suggest that shrimps relied more on algal-based carbon resources than terrestrially derived resources at all three sites along the continuum. This study supports other recent findings in tropical streams, demonstrating that algal-based resources are very important to stream consumers, even in small forested headwater streams. This study also demonstrates the importance of doing assimilation-based analysis (i.e., stable isotope or trophic basis of production) when studying food webs.

AB Movement of air under the canopy of a forest affects the gliding of animals such as frogs, snakes, geckos, and squirrels; the dispersal of pollen, seeds, and spores; as well as convective transport of heat and carbon dioxide. Wind speed profiles were measured under the canopy of a lowland rain forest during the morning, afternoon, and night at three sites in Costa Rica to determine the aerodynamic environment in which tree frogs maneuver while gliding. During the course of a day, average and maximum wind speeds were highest in the morning and midday, and lowest at night. Wind speeds under the canopy were highest near the top of the canopy and were lowest near the canopy floor in the morning and afternoon, and exhibited little variation with respect to height at night. Turbulence intensity (a common measure of gustiness) was constant (ca 1) for all times of day, heights in the canopy, and sites, but the absolute magnitudes of wind gust speeds were higher during the day than at night. Power spectral densities revealed that most of the variation in wind speeds occurred at frequencies that could potentially affect the gliding of tree frogs. Tree frogs (and many other gliding animals), however, glide at night and thereby avoid the higher wind speeds that occur by day. Computer simulations of the dynamic motions of frogs while gliding revealed that the night levels of wind gusts have little effect on the direction of gliding of tree frogs.

AB There is much interest in ways to exploit tropical timber without greatly changing forest processes and diversity. To achieve this, it is necessary to know the maximum logging intensity that can be used and how long the forest takes to recover from logging. Because little is known about the effects of selective logging on non-timber plant species, we examined the effects of logging intensity and time after logging on the diversity and abundance of flowering and fruiting understory plants in a Central Amazonian forest near Manaus, Brazil. Logging was carried out experimentally at varying intensities in eight 4 ha plots in 1987 and three plots in 1993. Logging intensity ranged between 14 and 45 m(3)/ha of extracted timber. Three plots were left as controls. Each month, from October 1996 to September 1998, we recorded the number of individuals and species of herbs, shrubs, small trees, and small palms that were flowering and fruiting in six transects per plot. We found 107 species flowering and 111 species fruiting. The abundance of flowering plants was affected by time after logging, but not by the intensity of logging. The abundance of fruiting plants was not related either to time after logging or logging intensity Richness of flowering and fruiting plants was related to time after logging, but not to the intensity of logging. The results indicate that selective logging, at the intensities and scale analyzed, does not cause reductions in flower and fruit production by the understory community. Both quantity and quality of resources for animals are maintained and possibly even increased in logged areas, shortly after logging takes place. As the levels of reproduction in plots logged 11 years before remained close to those in controls, maintenance of the understory community does not seem to be problematical.

AB Canopy structural data can be used for biomass estimation and studies of carbon cycling, disturbance, energy balance, and hydrological processes in tropical forest ecosystems. Scarce information on canopy dimensions reflects the difficulties associated with measuring crown height, width, depth, and area in tall, humid tropical forests. New field and spaceborne observations provide an opportunity to acquire these measurements, but the accuracy and reliability of the methods are unknown. We used a handheld laser range finder to estimate tree crown height, diameter, and depth in a lowland tropical forest in the eastern Amazon, Brazil, for a sampling of 300 trees stratified by diameter at breast height (DBH). We found significant relationships between DBH and both tree height and crown diameter derived from the laser measurements. We also quantified changes in crown shape between tree height classes, finding a significant but weak positive trend between crown depth and width. We then compared the field-based measurements of crown diameter and area to estimates derived manually from panchromatic 0.8 m spatial resolution IKONOS satellite imagery. Median crown diameter derived from satellite observations was 78 percent greater than that derived from field-based laser measurements. The statistical distribution of crown diameters from IKONOS was biased toward larger trees, probably due to merging of smaller tree crowns, underestimation of understory trees, and overestimation of individual crown dimensions. The median crown area derived front IKONOS was 65 percent higher than the value modeled from field-based measurements. We conclude that manual interpretation of IKONOS satellite data did not accurately estimate distributions of tree crown dimensions in a tall tropical forest of eastern Amazonia. Other methods will be needed to more accurately estimate crown dimensions from high spatial resolution satellite imagery.

AB We examined nutrient limitation to primary productivity in a secondary savanna in the interior branch of the Coastal Range of Venezuela, which was converted from forest to savanna more than 100 years ago. We manipulated soil nutrients by adding nitrogen (+N), phosphorus and potassium (+PK), and nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (+NPK) to intact savanna. Eleven months after fertilization, we measured aboveground biomass and belowground biomass as live fine roots in the top 20 cm of soil, and species and functional group composition in response to nutrient additions. Aboveground biomass was highest in the NPK treatment ([mean g/m(2)]; control = 402, +N = 718, +PK = 490, +NPK = 949). Aboveground production, however, appeared to be limited primarily by N. Aboveground biomass increased 78 percent when N was added alone but did not significantly respond to PK additions when compared to controls. In contrast to aboveground biomass, belowground biomass increased with PK additions but showed no significant increase with N (depth 0-20 cm; [mean g/m(2)]; control = 685, +N = 443, +PK = 827, +NPK = 832). There was also a 36 percent increase in root length with PK additions when compared to controls. Whole savanna shoot:root ratios were similar for control and +PK (0.6), while those for +N or +NPK fertilization were significantly higher (1.7 and 1.2, respectively). Total biomass response (above + belowground) to nutrient additions showed a strong N and PK co-limitation ([mean g/m(2)]; Control = 1073, +N = 1111, +PK = 1258, +NPK = 1713). Aboveground biomass of all monocots increased with N additions, whereas dicots showed no response to nutrient additions. Trachypogon spp. (T plumosus + T vestitus) and Axonopus canescens, the two dominant grasses, made up more than 89 percent of the total aboveground biomass in these sites. Tracbypogon spp. responded to NPK, whereas A. canescens, sedges, and the remaining monocots only responded to N. Even though nutrient additions resulted in higher aboveground biomass in N and NPK fertilized plots, this had little effect on plant community composition. With the exception of sedges, which responded positively to N additions and increased from 4 to 8 percent of the plant community, no changes were observed in plant community composition after I I months.

AB This study presents an analysis of floristic composition patterns for limestone vegetation from three Caribbean islands: Hispaniola, Mona, and Puerto Rico. The physical setting of these communities varies from very dry to wet climates, and from ridgetops, slopes, to plateaus. Consequently, vegetation communities have variable species composition. The questions addressed were: (1) What are the patterns of species composition among limestone vegetation types based on a parsimony analysis of species assemblages (PASA) and how congruent are they with geography, climate, topography, and vegetation physiognomy? and (2) How do PASA patterns compare to floristic patterns obtained with a classification (UPGMA) and an ordination (NMS)? The main distinction of floristic categories was between communities of humid and dry climates, followed by a finer separation Of Communities congruent with topography; vegetation physiognomy corresponded with both. PASA, UPGMA, and NMS produced highly coincident floristic groups; however, affinities among groups were different. Advantages of PASA over UPGMA and NMS are that PASA produces groupings Strictly based on the shared species and provides different measures of support for floristic groups. The three techniques indicated that the humid and dry limestone areas of Puerto Rico had floristically divergent dry type vegetation, even when they were structurally and physiognomically convergent. Also, floristic affinities of dry communities in Puerto Rico were stronger with dry communities on other islands than to more humid communities on the same island; thus, humidity regime is stronger than geography in promoting floristic links among limestone vegetation Communities of the Caribbean. Almost every Conclusion obtained from UPGMA and NMS was also taken from PASA, and so all three techniques arc compatible. The methodological, theoretical, and interpretive simplicity of PASA is what makes it an attractive procedure for Studies that examine composition patterns.

AB We documented the floristic composition of pteridophytes (ferns and fern allies) and Melastomataceae in Yasuni National Park, Amazonian Ecuador. Our main questions were: (1) Are the density of individuals, species richness, and/or species diversity (measured with Shannon's H') of the two plant groups related to edaphic differences? and (2) How many of the pteridophyte and Melastomataceae species are non-randomly distributed in relation to a soil base content gradient within terra firme (non-inundated forest). To answer these questions, we sampled 27 line transects of 500 X 5 in distributed in an area of ca 20 X 25 kin. The study area included a permanent 50 ha plot established to monitor forest dynamics; thus, our results also provide information on landscape-scale floristic variability to which results from within the plot can be compared. A total of 45,608 individuals and 140 species of pteridophytes, and 4893 individuals and 89 species of the Melastomaraceae, were counted in the transects. Both with pteridophytes and with Melastomataceae, a clear negative correlation was found between the amount of extractable bases in the soil and the number of plant individuals encountered in a transect. With Melastomataceae, species richness and species diversity also were negatively correlated with soil base content, but with pteridophytes they were not. More than 50 percent of the common species of both pteridophytes and Melastomataceae were nonrandomly distributed along the soil cation content gradient within terra firme. We conclude that while the species richness patterns observed in one plant group are not indicative of similar patterns in other plant groups, it seems likely that a substantial (but unknown) proportion of species belonging to other plant groups will be found to show distribution patterns that reflect edaphic preferences within terra firme forests.

AB Variation in leaf traits of dominant tree species in six montane rain forest communities was analyzed along an elevational gradient ranging from 1220 to 2560 in within a single basin at La Chinantla, Oaxaca, Mexico. Three groups of characters were used: morphological (leaf shape, margin, blade configuration, and phyllotaxy), morphometric (leaf area, leaf mass per area, stomatal density, and blade length/width ratio), and anatomical (thicknesses of blade, palisade [PP], and spongy [SP] parenchymae, PP/SP ratio, and epidermis and cuticle thicknesses). The variation of morphological characteristics was only evident at the highest elevations; in contrast, thickness of leaf blade, Pp SP, as well as leaf mass per area clearly increased along the gradient, whereas leaf area was the only variable that significantly decreased with elevation. Thicknesses of epidermis and of the two cuticles were not significantly correlated with elevation. A classification analysis based on a leaf trait matrix led to the distinction between low and high elevation communities, with an approximate limit between them at ca 2300 to 2400 in. The results are discussed in light of environmental changes occurring along elevational gradients. Leaf characteristics of montane rain forest plants offer important insights about the complex roles of abiotic Factors operating in these environments and supplement the traditional physiognomic classification schemes for these communities.

AB All broadleaf woody plants of pinelands and hammocks (upland areas) in the northern parts of Everglades National Park were defoliated by the strong winds of Hurricane Andrew in August 1992.. Most plants Fe-leafed within two months of the storm, at which time we tagged newly produced leaves of eight species (five species in two hardwood hammocks and four in two pineland sites; one species was studied in both habitats), and monitored individual leaf area lost or damaged monthly for three months. We marked a second cohort of new leaves on the same individuals four months later and monitored these for three months. Herbivory rates in leaves of the first cohort were lower than observed in pre-hurricane studies on two of the species, and lower in the first cohort than in the second cohort in six of the eight species studied, indicating that most insect herbivores were virtually absent for the first few months after the storm. Additionally, most species produced significantly larger leaves in the first cohort than the second cohort, and leaves of the second cohort were not significantly different in size from pre-hurricane leaves in one species for which pre-hurricane data were available. The large disturbance of the hurricane defoliated and reduced the above-ground biomass of the plants, but apparently also eliminated most herbivores and competition for light, facilitating the recovery of the plants.

AB The post-dispersal fate of Chrysophyllum lucentifolium (a canopy tree; Sapotaceae) seeds was analyzed in French Guiana over three consecutive years. Experiments using 750 thread-marked seeds were performed to investigate seed removal, predation, and caching by terrestrial vertebrates on howler monkey (Alouatta seniculus) defecation sites, where clumps of intact C lucentifolium seeds were observed. Year-to-year variations in seed fare during the peak fruiting period were considered in relation to overall fruit and seed resource availability estimated by a raked-trail survey. The effect of two forest areas, which differed in soil and floristic composition, was examined with conspecific fruiting tree density as a covariant. Exclosure versus open treatment was used to discriminate small rodents (not larger than a spiny rat) from other vertebrates. The presence of fresh howler dung did not affect seed fate after 20 days as shown by comparisons between defecation sites and control during the first year. There was a significant effect of year on the percentage of seeds remaining after 20 days. Low seed removal in 1995 and 1996 (compared to 1997) corresponded to higher overall fruiting and higher fruiting of C lucentifolium, or the presence of alternative resources for rodents. All effect of forest area was observed on the seed removal rate, which varied with years and protection. Comparatively, an effect of forest area on the percentage of seeds lost was observed in 1996 and an effect of treatment on the percentage of seeds eaten was seen in 1995. The mode of seed caching Suggested that spiny rats were the main seed remover. Results of this study suggest that greater seedling recruitment may Occur when large fruit crop and high howler dispersal co-occur with a lower impact of rodents (i.e., when rodents are saturated by abundant and diversified fruit resources such as in 1995). Such event synchrony, however, is highly unpredictable after only three years of study.

AB The detection of spatial variation in macroinvertebrate drift depends on the spatial scale of investigation in streams of the La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. Drift samples were taken in a spatially nested design, with two streams, two reaches per stream, two riffles per reach, and four replicate samples per riffle. Drift showed little variation among streams, but varied significantly at the scales of reach and riffle, with variation among samples also high. In addition, sampling took place at two temporal scales: diel and at two different periods that differed in rainfall conditions. Drift diel periodicity was;I clear pattern, while only density of individuals varied among sampling periods. This is the first study of macroinvertebrate drift at multiple spatial scales, despite the recognition that multi-scale studies are essential for a more complete understanding of community patterns and processes.

AB The epiphytic Bird's Nest Fern (Asplenium nidus complex) has a large basket-shaped rosette that accumulates leaf litter. We investigated the role of these ferns in supporting invertebrate populations in the primary lowland dipterocarp forest of Danum Valley, Sabah, Malaysia. Ferns were divided into three size classes: large (rosette diameter >60 cm), intermediate (30-60 cm), and small (<30 cm). Seven hectares of forest were surveyed: the canopy had a mean density of 30 large ferns/ha and 20 intermediate ferns/ha. Six large and five intermediate ferns were removed from the crowns of Parashorea tomentella (Dipterocarpaceae) at heights between 39 and 52 in. The largest ferns had fresh weights of ca 200 kg. The mean animal abundance in large and intermediate ferns was 41,000 and 8000, respectively. Termites and ants represented at least 90 percent of the abundance in these ferns. Of the I I ferns, 4 contained a nest of Hospitalitermes rufus (Nasutitermitinae), while another contained a nest of an undescribed species of Hospitalitermes. An additional 56 small ferns were removed from the low canopy (2-6 m above the forest floor), of which only I contained a termite nest (Nasutitermes neoparvus). These results suggest that Bird's Nest Ferns contain ca 0.5 million termites/ha and contribute almost one ton (dry mass) of suspended soil and plant material/ha. Five of the trees containing large ferns were fogged immediately before the removal of the ferns. From these samples we were able to estimate the total number of animals in each tree crown. When each estimate was added to the abundance in each fern, the results suggested that a single large fern may contain from 7 to 93 percent of the total number of invertebrates in the crown. Although these results must be treated with caution because of the small sample size, they have important implications for studies of canopy invertebrates.

DE behavior; Eleotris sandwicensis; fish models; habitat; Hawaii
ID BEHAVIOR
AB I examined behavioral responses of the benthic fish Eleotris sandwicensis to painted models (dummies) of fish that Eleotris typically encounter in Hawaii. Eleotris sandwicensis were associated with coarse substrates where their mean (+/-SE) density was 1.5 (+/-0.30) fish/m(2). I hypothesised that Eleotris would retreat from all models in open areas, but not when they were present in shelters. The five models represented Stenogobius hawaiiensis, Awaous guamensis, E sandwicensis (female coloration), a male E sandwicensis in breeding colors (black), and a 12 cm block of wood (control). Whether or not Eleotris held its position or retreated was not a function of body size. Differences among the responses of Eleotris to models depended on whether or not the fish was hidden or exposed on substrates. More retreats in response to models Occurred when Eleotris were exposed on substrates than when fish were hidden. There were no significant differences in the response of E. sandwicensis to models when fish were exposed On Substrates. In contrast, responses of E sandwicensis to the models were nor random for fish that were hidden, indicating that Eleotris discriminated among the models. The basis for discrimination among models was most likely visual. Although Eleotris are typically secretive, their presence on exposed substrates at this study site may be attributed to the lack of benthivorous fishes and few avian predators. The ability of Eleotris to distinguish among fishes when hidden as well as their tendency to retreat in response to all intruders whenever exposed on substrate surfaces could reduce potential interactions between Eleotris and other native and nonindigenous fishes.

We compared bird visitation patterns to two tree species (Dendropanax arboreus, Araliaceae; Bursera simaruba, Burseraceae) in continuous forest and remnants of riparian vegetation in a region dominated by pasture in Los Tuxtlas, Veracruz, Mexico. We quantified frequency of visitation, fruit consumption, consistency of visitation (percentage of total tree observation periods during which a given bird species was recorded), and species composition of birds at individuals of both tree species in continuous forest and riparian remnants. Bird visitation rate, species richness, and fruit consumption rates were similar within both tree species in the two habitats. Species assemblages at D. arboreus were different between continuous forest and remnants. Species assemblages at B. simaruba did not differ by habitat. Our results demonstrate that habitat disturbance may influence avian visitation patterns, which may in turn affect subsequent recruitment patterns in some tree species. Our results, however, were not consistent between the tree species, suggesting that it is difficult to generalize concerning the effects of forest disturbance on avian species assemblages in fruiting trees.

AB Typhoon Paka passed over Guam on 16 December 1997, and caused extensive damage to the Cycas micronesica population. Defoliation reduced subsequent stem extension and leaf size, and increased synchrony of flushes. Decapitated plants developed numerous adventitious buds on damaged steins during recovery. Toppled plants were selectively browsed by feral deer and pigs. Epiphytes increased susceptibility to decapitation or toppling. Growth reduction was minimal and ephemeral, indicating that this species is highly resilient to tropical cyclone damage.

AB Phenology, flowering biology, and pollination were studied for one year in four sympatric varieties of the polymorphic palm Geonoma cuneata in Ecuador. Flowering seasons of the three most common varieties were significantly staggered resulting in minimal temporal overlap. No marked differences were found with respect to flowering biology or pollination. The implication of these findings for explaining the complicated morphological variation pattern found in G. cuneata and similar species complexes is discussed.

AB The hypothesis that water depth, plant species, and the presence of submerged substrates influence seed dispersal by water was tested in a whitewater tributary of the Tocantins River of the Amazon Basin. Seed dispersal was greatest when water depth was greatest, which occurred during the new moon. Seeds of buoyant species with smaller seeds required less water for dispersal than large seeded species. Submerged objects reduced the distance dispersed but not the probability of dispersal.

AB Here we report massive seed predation of Pseudobombax grandiflorum (Bombacaceae) by Botogeris versicolurus (Psittacidae) in a forest fragment in Brazil. The intensity of seed predation was very high when compared to other studies in continuous forest, perhaps resulting from a scarcity of resources in such areas. This scarcity may limit the range of parrot's diet to a few plant species. It suggests that studies of Psittacidae seed predation may be important for conservation of some plants in fragments.

AB The forest type dominated by Peltogyne gracilipes (Caesalpiniaceae) on the riverine Maraca Island is the least species-rich of any recorded for Brazilian Amazonia. Because the forest has high soil and foliar Mg concentrations, and Mg is known to be toxic to plant growth at high concentrations, this study tested the hypothesis that dominance by Peltogyne is related to Mg leaf litter amounts and decomposition. We predicted that decomposition of Peltogyne leaves would differ from that of other species, and that their decomposition would result in a pulse of Mg release. Three plots (50 x 50 m) were established in each of three forest types: Peltogyne-rich forest (PRF; dominated by P gracilipes), Peltogyne-poor forest (PPF), and forest without Peltogyne (FWP). Three leaf litter decomposition experiments tested if decomposition of mixed leaf litter in coarse- mesh (CM) litterbags differed among forests (experiment 1); whether or not decomposition and nutrient release of Ecclinusa guianensis, Lueheopsis duckeana, and Peltogyne in CM litterbags differed among forests and species (experiment 2); and using fine-mesh (FM) litterbags, investigated the differences in the influence of faunal activity on Ecclinusa and Peltogyne decomposition (experiment 3). Decomposition was independent of the presence and dominance of Peltogyne, since decomposition rates in both PRF and FWP were in general lower than in PPE These differences appeared to be related to faunal activity. The decomposition of Peltogyne leaves was lower than that of the other species tested and was more affected by microbial and physical action. It is possible that the monodominance of Peltogyne is related to its deciduousness and faster decomposition in the dry season, which coincides with a large leaf fall. Magnesium was lost quickly from the Peltogyne leaves and the resultant pulses of Mg into the soil during the heavy rains at the beginning of the wet season may be deleterious for other species that are not adapted to high solution Mg concentrations. Results obtained were consistent with the hypothesis that Peltogyne dominance is related to the pattern of its leaf decomposition and the seasonal pulses of toxic Mg.

AB A yearlong arboreal baiting survey of ants was conducted during 1983 on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. Because of a severe El Nino event, the 1983 dry season in Panama was exceptionally long and dry with a distinct boundary between the dry and wet seasons. Baits, located on tree trunks, attracted. both terrestrial and arboreal ants, allowing comparisons between the two groups. Species composition at baits changed dramatically with season. Baits were primarily occupied by arboreal species during the dry season, while wet season baits were occupied mostly by terrestrial species. Arboreal and terrestrial ants differed markedly in their preferences for protein- or carbohydrate-based baits; arboreal ants preferred protein-based baits and terrestrial ants preferred carbohydrate-based baits. Foraging preference for protein suggests that protein resources were limiting for arboreal ants, particularly during the dry season, and that carbohydrate resources were limiting for terrestrial ants. Fundamental differences in arboreal and terrestrial habitats may promote the differences in foraging strategies observed during an annual cycle in a seasonal tropical forest.

AB Insects are important participants in many ecosystem processes, but the effects of anthropogenic and natural disturbances on insect communities have been poorly studied. To describe how disturbances affect insect communities, we addressed two questions: Do insect communities return to a pre-hurricane composition? And how do insect communities change during succession? To answer these questions, we studied insect communities in a chronosequence of two abandoned pastures (5 yr and 32 yr) and a mature forest (>80 yr) that were recently disturbed by two hurricanes (Hurricane Hugo, 1989; Hurricane Georges, 1998). Although insect abundance and richness fluctuated during the study, all sites returned to pre-hurricane (Hurricane Georges) abundance and richness in less than one year. All trophic categories present before Hurricane Georges were present after the hurricane, but richness within categories fluctuated greatly. Insect richness did not increase during succession; the 5 yr site had the highest richness, the >80 yr site had an intermediate richness, and the 32 yr site the lowest. Nevertheless, the species composition of the two forested sites was different in comparison to the 5 yr site. These results suggest that trophic structure varies little in time and space, but the species composition within each trophic category is highly variable.

AB Although most Carabidae are recognized as predacious, recent studies have shown that some tropical rain forest Carabidae use the small seeds of fallen fruit from some tree species as a key food resource (particularly figs [Moraceae] but also those from other families), Assemblages of carabid beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae) at fruit falls of the Melastomataceae tree genera, Bellucia, Loreya, and Miconia, were studied in a terra firme rain forest near Manaus (Amazonia, Brazil) from February 1992 to August 1996. Of 5483 specimens of 14 carabid species collected at 53 fruit falls, 98.2 percent of the collected beetles represented the seed-feeding genus Notiobia. Four of the 7 Notiobia species were found to reproduce at Melastomataceae fruit falls. The most abundant species, N. glabrata, was found to be a Melastomataceae seed generalist, while N. maxima seemed to prefer the seeds of Bellucia, and N. aulica and N. umbrifera the seeds of Miconia. The presence of larvae indicated reproduction of N. glabrata at fruit falls of all three tree genera and reproduction of N. maxima at those of Bellucia. Fruit falls of different species and genera of Melastomataceae appeared to occur at different times of the year and not continuously throughout the year. The seed-feeding Notiobia species, which specialize on Melastomataceae, used fruit falls of figs as migratory "stepping stones" during periods when there were no Melastomataceae fruit falls. The comparable suite of fig sced-feeding specialist species of Notiobia did not appear to do the reverse and seemed to avoid Melastomataceae fruit falls. The carabid assemblage at fig fruit falls was more diverse than the assemblage at those of Melastomataceae. Among the Melastomataceae, carabid species richness was highest at Miconia fruit falls and lowest at Loreya fruit falls. The three most common predatory species caught at Ficus fruit falls were also caught at those of Melastomataceae and appeared to reproduce at both fruit fall types. The proportion of the carabid assemblage accounted by predatory species was much lower at Melastomataceae (1.8%) than at fig fruit falls (8%).

AB Diversity of arboreal carabid beetles was sampled by fumigation in 100 3 x 3 m stations within a 100 x 1000 m terra firme forest plot in Ecuadorian Amazonia. Nine sampling dates from January 1994 to October 1996 yielded 2329 individuals belonging to 318 species of which more than 50 percent were undescribed species. A high percentage of the species sampled were rare; the proportion that occurred once per sampling date (singletons) ranged from 50.0 to 62.5 percent. Estimates of species richness were from 82 to 282 species of arboreal carabids in the study plot on a given sampling date. Most richness values were greater than 173 species. Species accumulation curves attained asymptotes for all but one sampling date, indicating that an adequate level of sampling effort was used to characterize the diversity of carabid fauna. Total accumulation curves based on pooled data failed to reach asymptotes. There was a high turnover in species composition between sampling dates; less than 50 percent of the species between the majority of sampling dates were shared, suggesting that the total species pool may be extremely large. Although species composition changed seasonally, species richness varied little. Spatial autocorrelation analysis revealed that the structure of this species assemblage was significantly patterned at distances below 280 m. Taken together, the large percentage of undescribed species, the failure of the overall species accumulation curves to level off, and the high turnover in species composition indicate that the species diversity of carabid beetles is far higher than previously thought.

AB The importance of bat pollination has been demonstrated for many plant species. Yet this mutualism has rarely been studied on a community-wide level. In this paper we present results of a yearlong study of a bat-flower community in cloud forests on the western slopes of the Ecuadoran Andes. Of eight plant-visiting bat species caught, only Anoura caudifera and A. geoffroyi were carrying pollen. These species of Anoura Supplement their diets with insects. Unlike glossophagines in other environments, however, which switch completely to a frugivorous or insectivorous diet during certain seasons, they are nectarivorous year-round and were never found with seeds or fruit pulp in their feces. Of the 13 morphotypes of pollen carried by the bats, 11 were identified to genus and 7 to species. Floral characteristics of all of these plants fit the traditional chiropterophilous syndrome well. Our study represents the first direct evidence of bat pollination for those plants identified to species, including four species of Burmeistera (Campanulaceae), as well as the first record of bat pollination for a plant of the genus Meriania (Melastomataceae). While overlap in the diets of the two Anoura was high, significant differences in visitation frequencies to particular plant species were detected. The larger bat species (A. geoffroyi) preferred large flowers, whereas the smaller species (A. caudifera) preferred small flowers.

To address whether or not fungi in a low-diversity tropical forest were released from this restriction, fruiting bodies of polypore basidiomycete fungi were collected from three species of mangroves (Avicennia germinans, Laguncularia racemosa, and Rhizophora mangle) in a Caribbean mangrove forest in Panama. Unlike other tropical forests, the polypore assemblage in this mangrove forest was strongly dominated by a few host-specialized species. Three fungal species, each with strong preference for a different mangrove host species, comprised 88 percent of all fungi collected.

AB We compared the seed fate of two animal-dispersed, large-seeded timber species (Dipteryx panamensis [Fabaceae] and Carapa guianensis [Meliaceae]) in logged and fragmented forests with that for continuous forest in northeastern Costa Rica. For both species, we quantified rates of seed removal (an index of vertebrate predation) and the fate of dispersed seeds (those carried away from their original location that either germinated or were not subsequently removed within three months). We predicted that (1) fewer seeds would be dispersed by vertebrates in fragmented forest than in continuous forest due to low population abundances after hunting and/or loss of suitable habitat, and (2) seed predation rates would be higher in forest fragments than in continuous forest due to high abundance of small-bodied seed consumers. We compared three forest fragments currently managed for timber (140-350 ha) and a large reserve of continuous forest (La Selva, 1500 ha and connected to a national park). An exclusion experiment was performed (seeds placed in the open vs. seeds within semipermeable wire cages; 5 cm mesh size) to evaluate the relative roles of large and small animals on seed removal. Seed germination capacity did not differ among all four sites for both species. Removal of Dipteryx seeds was higher in forest fragments (50% removal within 10 days and related to the activity of small rodents) compared to La Selva (50% removal after 50 days). Also, more Dipteryx seeds were dispersed at La Selva than in fragmented forests. Contrary to our predictions, removal of Carapa seeds was equally high among all four sites, and there was a trend for more seeds of Carapa to be dispersed in fragments than in La Selva. Our results suggest that fragmentation effects on tree seed fate may be specific to species in question and contingent on the animal biota involved, and that management strategies for timber production based on regeneration from seed may differ between forest patches and extensive forests.

AB Male euglossine bees were sampled with chemical baits every two months from September 1997 to July 1999 at nine sites in the Desengano mountain range, Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil. Four sites were located in Atlantic Forest mature second growth, two sites in disturbed forest, and three sites in forest fragments of 200, 156, and 14 ha, respectively. We collected 3653 male euglossine bees from at least 21 species. Analyses of variance indicated no differences amen g the three habitat types for total number of bees, and 5 of the 6 dominant species. Bootstrapping indicated significant variation in species richness and diversity for some sites, but there was no clear indication of differences among habitats. Similarity as measured with the Morisita-Horn index was inversely related to distance between sites, but relatively high for most site combinations. These results suggest that the euglossine bee community in the three habitats was essentially the same. Although some species were associated with each habitat type, most appeared to respond to temporal local conditions. Our results do not support the hypothesis that forest fragmentation or habitat alteration reduces abundance and diversity of euglossine bees.

AB Home range size, habitat utilization, and activity patterns of five adult Baird's tapirs (Tapirus bairdii) were studied via radiotelemetry from June 1995 to May 1996 in Corcovado National Park, Costa Rica. Estimates of 4153 animal locations were made. Home range sizes (95% minimum convex polygon) for the entire study period (wet season and dry season) averaged 125.0 ha (SD = 72.7), 94.9 ha (SD = 47.6), and 96.8 ha (SD = 51.2), respectively. Monthly home range sizes averaged 55.5 ha (SD = 32.1) and did not vary between seasons. Across the entire study, secondary forest, the most commonly used habitat type (61.3%) was utilized more than expected as predicted by availability (49.6%), while the second most used habitat, primary forest, was used (25.0%) less than expected (36.2%). The same general habitat selection pattern was observed in the dry season. Wet season habitat utilization values showed tapirs using both primary and secondary forest habitats in proportion to their availability. Diurnal and nocturnal activity levels were estimated at 20.2 and 80.4 percent, respectively. More diurnal and less nocturnal activity was observed during the wet season compared to the dry season.
