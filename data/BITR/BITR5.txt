ID FOOD WEB STRUCTURE; PATTERNS
AB The pitchers of Nepenthes madagascariensis are visited by a wide variety of insects attracted to the bright color of the pitcher, the nectar secreted around its opening and the odor of the fluid. The insect visitors appear to become disoriented over time and with increasing likelihood fall into the pitcher and drown. The pitchers form a temporary habitat functional for about three months. Several specialized arthropods including mosquito larvae (Uranotaenia bosseri, U. belkini), mites (Creutzeria sp.), and frit fly larvae (Chloropidae) complete their life cycle in the pitcher and depend directly or indirectly on the drowned insects falling into the pitcher. Colonization by these arthropods varies spatially and temporally between the two forms of pitchers (juvenile, rosette form and adult form). Mites (Creutzeria sp.) show a phoretic relationship in colonizing new pitchers by clinging to adult frit flies that emerge from the pitcher's fluid. Food web interactions in the Nepenthes madagascariensis pitcher are more complex than those reported by Beaver (1985).

ID TREE-HOLES; ECOLOGY; FOOD
AB In the lowland tropical forest at Pakitza, Peru, bamboo (Guadua weberbaueri Pilger) internodes with lateral perforations contain a diverse aquatic fauna. We found a community of 29 species dominated by Diptera, primarily mosquitos, and an undescribed helicopter damselfly (Mecistogaster). Although most studies of bamboo concern broken or cut culms filled with rainwater, the water in the live bamboo internodes that we studied was supplied by plant secretions. This results in an aquatic habitat that persists even during the pronounced local dry season. The lateral openings typically consist of closely-spaced rows of parallel slots and are possibly formed by the activities of ovipositing female katydids (Leiobliastes laevis Beier) and secondarily enlarged by various means. Succession in this community was found to follow the steps in development of the lateral opening; with increases in the average number of species and individuals, and percent of the total fauna present, as the opening size increased. We explored patterns of community structure by descriptive statistical analyses and constructed a tentative food web diagram of this simple aquatic ecosystem. Pairwise comparisons of ranked abundances of aquatic insects failed co show correlation, but internodes that contained a predator had higher average simple diversity of mosquito species than chose without, indicating a possible ''Paine effect.'' While species counts and counts of total individuals were not significantly correlated with type of lateral perforation, counts of individuals of all taxa per internode were correlated with size of lateral perforation. Number of mosquito species was signifcantly correlated with volume of water held in the internodes.

AB A Polybia occidentalis wasp was conditioned to collect sugar-water from a blue card (CB). In discrimination experiments, the wasp was able to detect the CB card when it was placed among 11 other cards that were all white, different shades of gray, different colors, or different shades of blue. The wasp made fewer mistakes in later trials than in earlier trials of each experiment, showing that she learned to focus on cues that were sufficient for discriminating between the CB card and the other cards present. The wasp was very successful at discriminating the CB card from other cards of similar brightness but that differed in their spectral reflection properties. The wasp's most common mistakes were with cards that were most similar to the CB card in their relative spectral reflection curves at wavelengths shorter than 575 nm. Cards that were similar in this region, and also reflected longer wavelengths, were most commonly confused with the CB card. Cards with reflection peaks in the blue region but that also reflected other wavelengths shorter than 575 nm were nor commonly confused with the CB card. Therefore, unlike a few hymenopteran species, Polybia does not seem to have a red-sensitive photoreceptor. Color vision was supported in chat the wasp discriminated between the CB card and cards chat varried in their spectral reflection properties, independent of light intensity. This is the first behavioral demonstration of color vision in the Polistinae and could further our understanding of the evolution and ecology of this large group.

AB The numerous Anolis species which are present in Cuba fill a place of great importance in the trophic webs of the terrestrial ecosystems, because they ear a considerable amount of arthropods, mainly insects. In order to know the food habits of one of the endemic species, Anolis argenteolus Cope, 1862, in a place of touristic use, 155 males and 161 females were collected at the La Mula camping base, on the south cease of Sierra Maestra, during the months of January, March, May, July, September and November. The digestive tract contents were analyzed and it was found that ants constituted the most frequent and important food item for both sexes during the two seasons of the year. The second place was occupied by dipterans, mainly domestic flies, and the third place, by scolitid coleopterans and lepidopteran larvae. Furthermore, this lizard includes in its food supply homopterans, lepidopterans, orthopterans, and araneids. The intraspecific differences observed in the food habits probably allow che sustenance of a numerous population.

AB We studied the mountain tapir Tapirus pinchaque in the Parque Natural Regional Ucumari and Parque Nacional Natural Los Nevados in the Central Cordillera of the Andes of Colombia. Direct and indirect observations as well as interviews with local people (11 families), were used to gather information. In approximately 40 km of tapir-trails in the Valle de los Venados region, foot prints of Tapirus pinchaque indicated a single family composed of a female (17 cm), male (16 cm), subadult (14 cm) and infant (6 cm). Along the tapir-trails there were three eating grounds (tree fall gaps in different succesional stages), five sleeping places (four inside the root systems of a large tree and one inside a Chusquea thicket), five scratching places and three sites with accumulation of feces. Tapirus pinchaque is a large herbivore chat eats between 23 and 46 plant species and uses salt licks. Currently there are records of 32 Tapirus pinchaque in Colombia, with 24 along the Central Cordillera, where the habitats of the mountain tapir (upper montane rain forest [2500-3200 m] and paramo vegetation [>3200 m]) are most threatened by deforestation. The effective protection of these habitats within the limits of the Parks is the first step toward the conservation of this rare and large mammal in danger of extinction.

AB In Sabah, Malaysia, logging operations leave substantial areas denuded of vegetation and topsoil. These sites are prone to erosion and slow to become reforested. Stands of pioneer trees established in these heavily disturbed sites may provide environmental conditions that foster recruitment of persistent forest species. Results of a field experiment indicate that recruitment of pioneer trees in recently logged sites is limited more by site conditions than by availability of seeds. In lightly disturbed areas, where the canopy is open and soils are uncompacted, seed addition does not increase the density of pioneer tree seedlings; resprouting vegetation covers such gaps within 3 mo following logging. On landings and skid nails, pioneer seedling densities increase initially following seed addition but by 12 mo after seeding, densities of pioneer seedlings are similar to those on unseeded areas. High seedling mortality in seed addition plots on skid nails and landings indicate that conditions on these compacted and nutrient poor sites during the first year after logging are unfavorable for the persistence of pioneer seedlings. On log landings, seedlings recruit adjacent to debris and bark fragments more frequently than expected by chance. Eighty percent of artificial seeds sown on landings and skid trails were washed away by overland water flow after three storms. The scattering of bark fragments and other small debris over denuded sites may assist seed capture and increase seedling survival temporarily, bur many seedlings die within a year. Improving harvesting practices to minimize the area scraped and compacted by heavy machinery will be more effective management than attempting to rehabilitate these areas following logging. The broadcasting of seeds of pioneer trees onto landings and skid nails immediately after logging may be a reasonable management option for hastening tree cover in denuded areas, but only if it is combined with site preparations that improve conditions for the survival of pioneer nee seedlings.

AB I fertilized dwarf Rhizophora mangle trees for two yr to determine how the morphology and internal anatomy of leaves are affected by increased nutrient availability. The sclerophyllous structure of R. mangle leaves decreased on P- and NPK-fertilized trees, but not on N-fertilized and control trees. Leaves from trees treated with phosphorus-containing fertilizers were 40 percent to 80 percent as thick as leaves on control trees. Differences in the hypodermis accounted for most differences in leaf thicknesses. In P- and NPK-fertilized trees, the thickness of the hypodermis in basal leaves was 225 (+/-13) mu m and 207 (+/-11) mu m, respectively, compared to 572 (+/-13) mu m in N-fertilized and 594 (+/-13) mu m in Control trees. Area per leaf and leaf length:width ratio did not change in response to increased nutrient availability. Nutrient deficiency rather than salinity and physiological drought appears to be the proximate cause of well-developed xeromorphic traits in leaves of dwarf red mangrove. This study provides experimental evidence of the oligotrophic-xeromorphic hypothesis that states that sderophylly is an adaptation to P-deficient soils rather than to drought or physiological drought.

AB We evaluated the ability to dose wounds inflicted with a drill to the trunks of seven common tree species from Barro Colorado Nature Monument, Panama. We predicted that species lacking wood antimicrobial activity would rapidly dose wounds to prevent pathogen entrance, while those species with wood antimicrobial defenses need nor necessarily exhibit fast wound closure. The species studied were Alseis blackiana, Gustavia superba, Miconia argentea, Poulsenia armata, Protium panamense, P. tenuifolium, and Tetragastris panamensis. Callus, resins, and latex were all involved in wound closure, but mechanisms varied among species: after 3 months, the only pioneer species, Miconia, had minimal diameter closure; Alseis showed intermediate closure only by callus; and the other five species (which did not differ) had almost completely plugged their wounds by means of combined callus and resin production (Tetragastris and both species of Protium), latex (Poulsenia), or callus and woody Bakes (Gustavia). Our initial prediction was supported for Gustavia and Poulsenia (i.e., rapid wound closure and no wood antimicrobial activity) but not for Tetragastris and Protium (that showed both rapid wound closure and strong wood antimicrobial activity); Miconia showed slow wound closure and no wood antimicrobial activity. Only for Alseis, was wound closure rate proportional to stem diameter growth.

AB We examined correlatively the joint effects of light, supporting plant characteristics, plant site, and floral display on pollinia removal and fruit production of 103 individuals of the orchid Brassavola nodosa (L.) Lindl. at Peter Douglas Gay, Belize, Central America. This orchid is epiphytic on red mangroves (Rhizophora mangle L. [Rhizophoraceae]), and grows from 1-300 cn above ground. Light levels above each orchid, measured as direct site factor using hemispherical canopy photography, were 6-46 percent of potential direct sunlight. To characterize plant size, we counted the number of leaves of each plant and measured is longest leaf and the leaf subtending each inflorescence. The largest orchids were found in areas of high light availability, high above ground, and on large support structures. From June through early August 1993, and again in December 1993, orchids were surveyed every 3-4 days for reproductive status and success (removal of pollinia and/or fruit production). The 48 plants that flowered during these 7 months had more and longer leaves than the 55 piano that did nor Bower at any time in this time period. Plants flowered continuously throughout the summer; a complete reproductive cycle (bud appearance to fruit set) lasts 2-5 weeks. Pollinia were removed from 12 percent, and fruits were set by 30 percent, of the Bowers produced in the summer. Because fruit set was much lower in the fall, the total proportion of fruit production relative to Bower production over the 7-month study period was only 13 percent. Path analysis indicated that direct site factor, height above ground, and diameter of supporting structures significantly contributed to plant size and floral display area. In rum, floral display significantly affected both male and female reproductive success. We conclude that resources limit Bower production and components of floral display, whereas pollinator availability likely limits reproductive success in Brassavola nodosa.

AB Floral scent was collected with head-space adsorption and analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry for 12 species of Neotropical Lecythidaceae in the genera Corythophora, Couratari, Couroupita, Eschweilera, Grias, Gustavia, and Lecythis. Most of the species were dominated by a single floral scent compound. Most of the compounds identified in this study have been previously reported in floral scents collected with head-space techniques from other plant families. However, several of the fatty acid derived ewers of hexanol and cis-3-hexenol present in Lecythis persistens have been reported only in one or a few other plant families. No apparent correlations were found between amount and number of floral scene compounds produced on the one hand and pollinator reward, morphology, color, or size of flowers on the other hand. The fatty acid derivatives found in Grias suggest chat beetles may be the pollinators whereas the floral scent compounds of all other species studied are consistent with bee pollination. The floral scents of the nectar-producing species Eschweilera coriacea and Couratari stellata contain, in contrast to the pollen-producing species, compounds that are highly attractive to male euglossine bees. This suggests that floral scent may play a role in directing male euglossine bees to those species of Lecythidaceae providing nectar as a pollinator reward. The combination of secondary and primary floral attractants interacting with pollinators probably accounts for much of the species diversity of this family in Neotropical forests.

AB The floral biology of the tree Mabea fistulifera and the behavior of its floral visitors were studied in Vicosa, Minas Gerais St-ate, southeastern Brazil. M. fistulifera is monoecious and self-incompatible. Its inflorescences present a female phase that lasts ten days, followed by a bisexual phase of three days during which animals exploit the nectar and pollen produced by male flowers. pollination is effected by nocturnal as well as diurnal visitors, including mammals, birds and insects. The bats Artibeus lituratus, Vampyrops lineatus and Sturnira lilium and the opossum Didelphis marsupialis are the nocturnal pollinators. Several passerine birds and bees are the diurnal pollinators. The broad spectrum of unspecialized pollinators suggests that M., fistulifera reproduction may be little affected by disturbances of the animal community. Besides being visited by pollinators, the inflorescences are also visited by nectar thieves such as the flower bat Glossophaga soricina and hummingbirds.

AB The reproductive biology of three syntopical palm species, Bactris bifida, B. monticola, and B. gasipaes was investigated to determine their pollination strategies and pollinators, and to elucidate their impact on pollination for the local palm assemblage.
   In Peruvian Amazonia, Bactris is pollinated mainly by beetles of the genera Phyllotrox (Curculionidae) and Epurea (Nitidulidae), which are attracted to the protogynous, heavily scented inflorescences for mating and oviposition. In experiments (N = 15), beetles were constantly raised in the staminate flowers, which abscise after anthesis. Pollinator activity is crepuscular-nocturnal and the beetles change from male phase inflorescences to female phase inflorescences during twilight. The non-overlap of sexual phases within individuals largely promotes outbreeding in Bactris. The extensively cultivated B. gasipaes is pollinated by other species of Phyllotrox and Epurea than the primary forest species B. bifida and B. monticola. The latter two share the same pollinators with two species of Desmoncus. These species constitute an assemblage of reproductively similar palms. The beetle pollinators are associated with the palms mainly ar. and above the generic level, although development of their larvae in the abscised flowers of the host species probably leads to a chemical preference and thus ''flower constancy'' to that species. At the end of the host plant's flowering period beetles may switch to another assemblage member, because the palms provide the same resources. The assemblage members are patchily distributed, and population density in such parches is extremely high. They show staggered flowering and the most abundant species within the assemblage flower 2 or even 3 times a year, while less abundant species flower once a year.

AB Patterns of seed rain were observed at five forest locations in recent treefall gaps and paired understory sites in a tropical wet forest in northeast Costa Rica. Seed rain was dominated by animal-dispersed species. Overall, significantly more wind-dispersed seeds arrived into treefall gaps than into forest understory. Contrary to expectations, understory sires received a greater seed rain than did gap sites during three of four sample periods over the course of one year. Considerable spatial heterogeneity, however, existed among forest locations, with some forest sites receiving up to three times more seed rain input than ochers. Results from this seed rain study generally marched those from an earlier study at this sire in terms of seed rain volume and dominant plane families. Composition of seed rain was more similar among habitat types (i.e., gap, understory) than among forest locations (i.e., paired sites) suggesting that spatial foraging activity and habitat preference of seed dispersers result in non-random patterns of seed rain. If true, then such patterns have implications for evolution of fruit and seed characters that promote survival and establishment of seeds under certain environmental conditions.

AB Guanacaste seeds in Venezuela accumulate beneath parent trees presumably because of extinct seed dispersers. We asked if the number of eggs laid per seed by the bruchid beetle Starer generalis and factors affecting this oviposition pattern are consequences of seed accumulation. We compared patterns of oviposition to theoretical expectations and to another study on a congeneric bruchid which faced limited seed availability. Theory predicts bruchids should lay one egg per seed when many seeds are readily available and when there are only negative effects to multiple eggs on seeds. From collections of hundreds of seeds from beneath three trees, we found the median number of eggs per seed to range from 4 to 8.5, even though many seeds (33%) had zero eggs. These patterns of oviposition were nonrandom. Theory also predicts that when seeds are limited, mote eggs per seed should be laid. Thus, the relatively high numbers of eggs per seed on guanacaste seeds could be an anachronism more appropriate for limited seed availability. Alternatively, other factors associated with seed accumulation may cause increased egg densities. Indirect evidence suggests multiple oviposition may be more frequent, and that density dependent egg parasitism has changed from positive to negative, which selects for increased egg densities.

DE activity period; camera-trapping; cathemeral; diurnal; mammals;
   nocturnal; raptors; tropical rain forest
AB Activity periods of rain forest animals, especially those with flexible activity periods, are poorly known. We used camera trapping to describe the activity periods of at least partly terrestrial wildlife in 2 Sumatran and 1 Javan rain forest sites. We used these data and a comparison with the literature to classify all mammalian taxa occurring in the study areas as either diurnal, nocturnal, or cathemeral (potentially active during both day and night). Exploratory analyses revealed that body size and substrate are the major correlates of activity period, with diet and travel mode playing minor roles. We explain the substrate effect by noting thar vision-related constraints force diurnal mammals in an arboreal environment to stay diurnal regardless of conditions, and that nocturnal mammals are kept from becoming diurnal by predation risk by visually hunting diurnal predators. To explain why the largest animals are cathemeral we suggest that they require more time to forage than is provided by the roughly 12-hour diurnal or nocturnal period.

AB Laboratory experiments were conducted to establish the fecal pellet production races for four species of tropical millipedes representing the three most common families in the savanna habitats of southern Africa. Fecal pellets were produced at mean races of between 4.2 and 12.8 pellets per day and varied in individual mass from 8.0 to 85.0 mg with significant variation due to species, sex, and body mass. These results were combined with data on density, species composition, individual size distribution within populations, and seasonal activity to predict field fecal pellet production by millipedes in four different habitats. In natural woodlands fecal pellet production was between 32.7 (woodland) and 64.9 g m(-2) yr(-1) (savanna) equivalent to 6 and 39 percent of the litter standing crop. In plantations fecal pellet production amounted to less than 1 percent of litter standing crop. The implications of these results are discussed in relation to the role of litter feeding detritivores in influencing rates of decomposition in tropical habitats.

DE bat roosting behavior; caves; Desmodus rotundus; local migration;
   neotropical bats; population ecology
AB A mark-recapture study of cave bats was carried out in the Alto Vale do rio Ribeira, SE Brazil. The size of the colonies varied monthly, indicating the occurrence of frequent movements among caves and a low degree of roost fidelity for the commonest species: Desmodus rotundus, Carollia perspicillata, Anoura caudifer, Artibeus fimbriatus. Phyllostomines (Trachops cirrhosus, Chrotopterus auritus) and Peropteryx macrotis seem more sedentary, as suggested by their higher recapture rates. D. rotundus uses multiple roosts, mostly within relatively small areas, with a 2-3 km radius. These vampires move preferentially along valleys, males moving more than females. Frequency of movements is probably related to the availability of roosts and climate. The climate of the Alto Ribeira is subtropical, with cool nights during the ''dry'' season, when part of the vampire population (and other species as well) would migrate to warmer regions. Recapture races and the estimated individual ranges are similar to those observed for this species in other regions. The minimum population density of D. rotundus varied monthly from one to 3.5 individuals per km(2). Diphylla ecandata moves more frequently and probably has larger individual ranges than D. rotundus, possibly due to its higher feeding specialization.

ID STANDING CROP; FORESTS; CARBON
AB Fine litterfall (primarily leaves, twigs up to 1 cm diameter, and reproductive parts) was collected weekly over a 5 year period from 30 traps randomly arranged in each of two 0.5 ha plots in tropical rainforests at two contrasting sites (lowland and tableland) in North Queensland and sorted by species and components. Annual fine litterfall (+/- 95% confidence limits) was 8.00 +/- 0.36 Mg ha(-1) at the lowland site and 11.03 +/- 0.47 Mg ha-L at the tableland site. The range over 5 years of annual fine litterfall was not great (7.04-8.74 Mg ha(-1) at the lowland site; 10.02-13.64 Mg ha(-1) on the tableland), but reproductive material varied substantially, both in absolute amount (0.85-1.86 and 1.41-4.74 Mg ha(-1)) and as a percentage of total litterfall for any year (12-21% and 14-35%) for lowland and tableland sites respectively. A seasonal maximum (October/November-hot dry season) was most evident for the old leaf component. Fruits and flowers were more irregularly spread through the year. The mean ratio of annual litterfall mass of reproductive material to leaves was 0.32. We attributed the high value of this ratio to our shorter sampling interval (7 days) compared to longer intervals used in most other tropical rainforest litterfall studies. Comparing our results with other Australian studies, we estimated that fruit and flower mass in litter traps in tropical rainforest declines 50 percent every 10 days relative to leaf litter mass.

AB The stem allometry (tree height versus stem diameter) of four tree species found in a North Queensland rainforest was examined. These species were dicotyledonous trees, two of which were classed as early successional species and two as later successional species. No significant differences (P > 0.05) were found in the stem allometry of dicotyledonous trees of the same successional status. However, significant differences (P < 0.05) in stem allometry were found when comparing species of different successional status. Later successional species, but not early successional species, were found to be ''elastically similar'' to a theoretical buckling limit. The relationship between stability safety factors and tree height indicated chat both early and later successional species have large buckling safety margins when of low stature. At medium statures (subcanopy), early successional species display a moderate buckling safety margin while later successional species exhibited their lowest buckling safety margin. At tall statures (canopy and above), early successional species exhibited their lowest buckling safety margin while later successional species had moderate buckling safety margins. Stem allometry may be influenced by a tree's life-span, wood density, and environmental conditions in its crown region.

DE allometry; leaf size; Malaysian rain forest; ontogeny; tropical trees
ID ALLOMETRY
AB It is common lore that saplings of tropical rain forest trees have larger leaves than do adult trees; however, there is very little data available to quantitatively evaluate such ontogenetic changes in leaf size. To address this issue, we measured randomly sampled fully expanded leaves from saplings and adult trees in 51 species found in primary lowland tropical rain forest at Pasoh Forest Reserve, West Malaysia. Length and width of the leaf laminae were measured on 8 leaves/tree of 3 saplings and 3 adults of each species, using fallen leaves to sample the adult trees of larger species. Of the species examined, about half (26/51) exhibited smaller leaves on adult trees than saplings, while 13 species had larger leaves on adults, and 12 species showed differences of <10 percent on an area basis. The direction and degree of ontogenetic changes in leaf size was related to tree stature: understory treelets tended to have larger leaves as adults, while canopy trees tended to have smaller leaves as adults than as saplings. However, a few canopy species deviated from this pattern, having significantly larger leaves on adult trees. For one such canopy species (Garcinia nervosa) and a smaller-statured congener (G. malaccensis) we sampled leaves from trees spanning a wide range of size classes. Both species exhibited a non-monotonic relationship between leaf size and tree size, showing a peak in leaf size at stem diameters dose to the species-specific size at reproductive onset. We suggest that decreases in leaf size following reproductive onset may in many cases result from the physiological effects of carbon allocation to reproductive structures, rather than adaptive acclimation to altered light regimes.

AB Viviparous seedlings of the red mangrove, Rbizophora mangle L., were collected from adult trees growing in areas of low (5 parts per thousand) and high (36 parts per thousand) surface water salinities, and planted as groups in large rectangular pots and treated with seawater corresponding to the two natural concentrations. Among individuals collected from the same site, growth was significantly enhanced in the low (5 parts per thousand) versus high (36 parts per thousand) salinity treatment. Stem and leaf development exhibited larger differences between high and low salinities than did root growth. Propagules showed no increased capacity for growth when treated with salinities similar to the parent tree environments. Seedlings from the high salinity site exhibited faster growth than those from the low salinity site when treated with low salinity water. However, differences between sites were insignificant in the high salinity treatment. Results are discussed in the context of vivipary as a preconditioning mechanism for sale-tolerance and the general effects of salinity on physiological and possible generic aspects of early development.

AB In four hectares of primary montane wet forest in Monteverde, Costa Rica, 1403 live trees (>10 cm diameter at breast height) were censused for major damage and mortality during a four-year period. Overall tree damage and mortality after four years was 15.9 trees ha(-1) yr(-1), with over 80 percent due to snapping of trunks and uprooting of whole trees. Of the 73 stems that snapped during the study interval, 20 regenerated live foliage from their broken seems. This resulted in an actual mortality rate of 12.7 trees ha(-1) yr(-1), or 2.2 percent, which is in the mid-range of annual tree mortality reported for other forests. Tree death occurred during all seasons of the year, but rates were highest during the wet season. Individuals of gap-colonizing species died at a higher rate than expected from their representation in the population. This study suggests chat although montane sites are subject to high winds and unstable soils, overall rates and types of mortality are similar to lowland forest sites.

One hundred uprooted trees were evaluated in order to investigate the sprouting ability of different species and size classes, and to determine the extent of contribution of sprouting to gap closure. The large proportion (82%) of sampled trees with live sprouts indicates that uprooting need nor be associated with the death of the tree. The occurrence of sprouting, while independent of the diameter of the fallen trunk, varied greatly among species. Al the sampled trees found with sprouts fit the definition of non-pioneer species. This study suggests that sprouts may compete successfully with pioneer trees in the process of gap closure.

AB In October 1988, Hurricane Joan severely damaged 500,000 ha of rain forest in southeastern Nicaragua. By and large, the forest is regenerating directly without passing through a secondary stage. However, an apparent exception to the pattern of direct regeneration was the behavior of Cecropia, a pioneer tree which experienced a dramatic pulse of recruitment in some areas. Nineteen ninety-one was the peak year of recruitment of Cecropia, but since then its pulse has decayed rapidly due to heavy mortality. The decline appears to be related to the unusually low rate of occupation by Cecropia's mutualistic Azteca ants: unoccupied trees had significantly higher mortality rates than occupied trees.

AB Enlarged or deformed floral tubes of the herbaceous perennial plant genus Cuphea have been noted by many collectors but without knowledge of the causative agent. A survey of herbarium collections of Cuphea found enlarged, thickened or inflated, sometimes exceptionally hairy flowers present in nine species from Mexico, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Panama, and Ecuador. Investigation determined the enlargements were due to two different gall-forming parasites. Cuphea appendiculata, C. cyanea, C. hookeriana, C. llavea, C. nitidula, and C. spectabilis in the closely related sections Diploptychia, Heterodon, and Leptocalyx are hosts to Asphondylia sp. (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae), a gall midge. Asphondylia is notable for its apparent symbiotic relationship to fungi which grow in the gall. Cuphea bombonasae, C. epilobiifolia, and C. spraguei, of section Heteranthus, are parasitized by Mompha sp. (Lepidoptera: Momphidae), a microlepidopteran that feeds on the reproductive organs of the flower. These are the first records of gall-forming genera parasitizing the Lythraceae and are new host records for the insects. Flowers infected by either parasite produce no seeds. However, the number of infected vs. non-infected plants is relatively low (14% gall midge infection in C. cyanea and 22% Mompha sp. infection in C. epilobiifolia), and among the multi-flowered influorescences of any plant, at lease 80 percent of the flowers remain free of galls, suggesting the gall makers strike a balance in their parasitism that does not excessively threaten the plant species on which it depends.

AB Local sampling of larval lepidopterans on Erythroxylum host plant species in tropical savanna (cerrado) revealed a high species richness with low abundance per species. Cumulative numbers of morphospecies with increasing sampling effort yielded no asymptotic level of richness in sampling periods lasting 6 mo, 7 mo, and 23 mo. Peak richness was reached at 31 species in 1992 and 19 species in 1993, on the three Erythroxylum species sampled: E. deriduum, E. suberosum, and E. tortuosum. Less than one larva was found per plane during all sampling times, with a mean of 0.28 species per plant in 1992 and 0.12 in 1993. The number of specimens of all species combined discovered per plant was very low at 0.10 per plant. Many plants remained unattacked on any sampling date with 12 percent, 8 percent, and 16 percent of planes attacked in the species listed in order above. In general, there was an increase in species found during the late dry season when new leaves were produced, but plane phenology seemed to exert only a small influence.
   Comparisons with temperate samples of a similar kind, in savanna vegetation at the same altitude, indicate a very different assemblage. Comparison was based on four criteria: richness was from two to over three times higher in the tropics, even though sampling had not produced an asymptotic accumulation of species; the number of morphospecies per plant individual was similar at the sites, although total richness was lower in the temperate savanna; the number of total individuals per plant was 11-fold higher in the temperate samples; and the percent of plants with larvae present was over four times higher in the temperate zone (mean of 49%) than in the cerrado (12%). The high richness of relatively rare species in the cerrado site poses challenges in understanding the reasons for such rarity, the organization of such assemblages, the gradient of species richness from low to high latitudes, the estimation of biodiversity, and conservation management.

AB We examined the effectiveness with which two common understory birds, Andropadus latirostris and A. tephrolaemus (Pycnonotidae), dispersed seeds of a tropical pioneer forest tree, Maesa lanceo(ata (Myrsinaceae). Relative dispersal effectiveness of each species was assessed in terms of quantity and quality of seed dispersal. The number of seeds dispersed was examined by quantifying the tree visitation frequency, duration of time in the tree and number of fruits ingested, and probability that the bird would deposit seeds under the parent tree. The quality of seed dispersal was examined using defecation frequency, number of seeds defecated through time following ingestion of a cohort of 20 fruits, seed viability after passage through the gut, and general diet analysis. A,ndropadus tephrolaemus and A. latirostris were the most common visitors to M. lanreolata and accounted for 49.1 percent and 17.3 percent of all animal visits to the tree, respectively. The mean (and standard deviation) residence times in the tree were 2.82 +/- 1.65 min for A. tephrolaemus and 3.14 +/- 1.70 min for A. latirostris. Individuals of both species are estimated 23 to 25 fruits per visit (3-20 seeds/fruit). Mean minimum seed passage times were 17.8 +/- 1.93 min for A. tephrolaemus and 12.9 +/- 0.80 min for A. latirostris. Seeds were viable after passing through the birds' gut. The majority of seeds passed through the gut within 20 min of the first defecation that contained seeds, and nearly all seeds passed within 80 min of ingestion. Mean time between defecations was 2.6 min for A. tephrolaemus and 2.2 min for A. latirostris. Frequency of return to the tree combined with the short tree residence rimes and defecation rates suggest that both species are unlikely to defecate more than 5 percent or 10 percent of seeds under the parent tree. Both species consistently dispersed most seeds away from the parent tree; A. tephrolaemus may be a more important disperser for the tree, however, because of its higher visitation rate.

AB Genetic variation was surveyed in three understory plant species in tropical wet forest at Estacion Biologica La Selva, Costa Rica: Henriettea tuberculosa (Melastomaceae), Psychotria officinalis and P. suerrensis (Rubiaceae). These three shrub species showed moderate to high levels of genetic variation, but Psychotria officinalis and P. suerrensis had a higher proportion of polymorphic loci and greater levels of heterozygosity than did Henriettea tuberculosa. All three species have insect-pollinated flowers and bird-dispersed berries; the two Psychotria species are distylous and self-incompatible. Lower levels of genetic variation in Henriettea tubertulosa are hypothesized to be a result of lower outcrossing rates and local seed movement.

AB Changes in diet composition related to increase in fish size were studied in a rainbow trout (Onrorhynchus mykiss) population inhabiting a stream of the high Venezuelan Andes. The analysis of 319 gut contents of trout in five size classes showed that immatures of Ephemeroptera, Trichoptera, and Diptera are the main components of the diet. The contribution in number and biomass of these groups changed with fish size. Ephemeropterans are dominant in the diet of fishes in size classes under 15 cm. Ephemeropterans and Trichopterans share their importance in number and biomass in the diet of trout in size classes over 15 cm. Seasonal changes of total prey numbers and biomass in gut contents did not affect the proportional contribution of the different taxa within each size class. The infra-order taxa with most relative importance were the genera Baetodes, Baetis, and Thraulodes (Ephemeroptera); Leptonema, Arctopshyche, and Mortoniella (Trichoptera); the families Chironomidae, Blepharoceridae, and Tipulidae (Diptera) and terrestrial invertebrates. The trophic profiles of Relative Importance of preys differed significantly between size classes as a consequence of a differential use of the drift and benthos fauna, and changes in prey selection within each food source.

AB A common practice by rural people in China is to harvest litter and understory from forests to meet their fuel needs. Our study was to determine the impact of this practice, occurring for over 40 yr, on the storages and flows of organic matter in a native pine forest in the Dinghushan Biosphere Reserve. This forest was established to rehabilitate severely degraded lands, and trees were not allowed to be harvested but understory plants and litter were harvested. Despite the initial condition of the site, its relatively young state, and the continued removal of understory plants and litter, there was total of 45 plant species in the study site. The total standing stock of organic matter was 135 Mg ha(-1) with about 60 percent in the trees and 28 percent in the top 10 um of soil Understory and litter, the two components harvested, were about 4 percent of the total standing stock. Total aboveground biomass production was 8.4 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1), with about 45 percent contributed by the understory. The average annual amount of litter and understory harvested (3.3 Mg ha(-1)) was 55 percent of the annual production. Compared with adjacent similar-aged broadleaf and mixed pine-broadleaf forests and other tropical pine forests where organic materials were not harvested, our site had less structural complexity and was cycling organic matter more slowly than its potential. Harvesting the net production of trees, with a replanting program, coupled with litter removal only provided the same quantity of organic matter, but was proposed as a more efficient method of fuel production because it would allow the soil organic matter, soil fertility, and tree regeneration to improve, while at the same time provide a higher quality fuel and reduce the time expended by women in fuel gathering.

AB The effects of litter and understory harvesting by local people on the nutrient cycle in a pine forest in Dinghushan Biosphere Reserve (DHSBR) of subtropical China were studied by quantifying nutrient distribution, recycling, and loss in the ecosystem. The total nutrient standing stocks were estimated to be 2066 kg ha(-1) for N, 282 kg ha(-1) for P, 541 kg ha(-1) for K, 491 kg ha(-1) for Ca, and 151 kg ha(-1) for Mg. Mast of these nutrients were contained in the top 10 cm of soil (72 to 94%). The total quantity of nutrients in the production of litterfall and understory were: 43.5 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) for N, 1.7 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) for P, 16.1 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) for K, 10.9 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) for Ca, and 2.7 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) for Mg. The harvest practice removed substantial quantities of these nutrients, 44 to 73 percent of the amount in litter and understory production, a rate that appeared to exceed most nutrient inputs from atmospheric deposition. In addition to the direct removal of nutrients, the harvest practice also reduced the active soil organic matter pool thus reducing nutrient mineralization and soil nutrient availability. An alternative system of tree harvest and replanting, combined with litter removal only, was proposed that reduced by one-third or more the present nutrient removals.

AB The decomposition rates and mass of fine ( < 10-cm-diameter) and coarse ( > 10-cm-diameter) woody detritus were measured in the dry tropical forests of the northeastern Yucatan Peninsula. The smallest mass of woody detritus was found in undisturbed stands: fine fractions averaged 4.7 Mg ha(-1) and coarse fractions ranged between 13 and 38 Mg ha(-1). The largest mass of fine woody detritus (32.2 Mg ha(-1)) was found in a hurricane-disturbed forest; whereas, the largest mass of coarse woody detritus (99.5 Mg ha(-1)) was found in stands disturbed by catastrophic fires. A decomposition time-series study installed in 1989 indicated that decomposition rates varied greatly among species and diameters of branch segments. Over a 4-year period, the decomposition rate constant for fine woody detritus ranged from 0.151 to 1.019 year(-1) and that for coarse woody detritus ranged from 0.008 to 0.615 year(-1). The half-life of woody detritus increased 33-fold (among pieces ranging from 1 to 30 cm in diameter) for the most decay-resistant species (Manilkara zapota) but was relatively constant for the least decay-resistant species (Bursera simaruba). The wide range in decomposition rates observed in these forests indicates that the poor substrate quality of some species may override climatic (e.g., warm temperatures) and biotic (e.g., termites) factors favorable to rapid decomposition, leading to a substantial accumulation of woody detritus.

AB Analyses of leaf osmolality and total nutrient content (N, P, K, Ca, Mg) of the coastal vegetation of the Sontecomapan lagoon (Veracruz, Mexico) reveals the influence of penetration of sea water, and the differences in mineral uptake by typical halophytic species (Rhizophora mangle and Laguncularia racemosa), facultative halophytes (Acrostichum aureum) and non-halophytes (Pachira aquatica). In these species leaf sap osmotic pressure and the leaf area/weight ratio increase, while the leaf area decreases with the salinity of interstitial water. Total N and P contents are correlated in all species, and in the mangrove species their contents decrease in the sampling sites with higher influence of marine water. The K/Na ratio is considerably higher in the non-halophyte species (P, aquatica 15.9; A. aureum 18.1 to 14.1) compared to the halophytic mangrove species (R. mangle 1.4 to 0.6; L, racemosa 3.3 to 1.9).

AB Wet and dry season rates of photosynthesis and stomatal conductance were compared for upper canopy leaves of six species of tropical semi-deciduous forest trees. Photosynthetic rates showed no dear relationship to leaf form (simple/compound), specific leaf area, or seasonality (evergreen/deciduous). Photosynthetic rates for three of five evergreen species were similar in wet and dry seasons. The rates (in mu mol m(-2) sec(-1)) were 14.5 (wet season) and 15.5 (dry season) for Didymopanax morototoni, 13.8 (wet season) and 12.2 (dry season) for Ficus obtusifolia, and 10.4 (wet season) and 10.2 (dry season) for Luebea seemannii. In the dry season, stomatal conductance for all five evergreen species was half or less than in the wee season, except in Didymopanax, for which conductance was high in both seasons. For Anacardium excelsum and Cecropia longipes, photosynthetic rates in the dry season (4.71 and 6.38 pmol m(-2) sec(-1), respectively) were lower than in the wet season (8.62 and 12.4 mu mol m(-2) sec(-1)). For these species, the lower photosynthetic rates in the dry season were observed at internal CO2 concentrations (C-i) as high or higher than wet season C-i, suggesting: that photosynthetic activity was reduced by water stress. Pseudobombax septenatum, a dry season deciduous species, sometimes showed low levels of photosynthesis and stomatal conductance as well as low C-i levels, suggesting chat stomatal closure restricted photosynthetic activity. Higher stomatal conductance was associated with higher rates of photosynthesis among species and between seasons.

AB Predation on mangrove propagules was studied to assess its impact on the intertidal distribution of Rhizophora mangle, Avicennia germinans, and Laguncularia racemosa. Field experiments conducted on a mangrove island range (Twin Gays) in Belize showed that rates of predation (percent of propagules rendered nonviable in 9 days) just after peak dispersal (December) were highest for A, germinans (60 +/- 8%) and significantly lower for R, mangle (18 +/- 5%) and L. racemosa (28 +/- 9%), which were not significantly different. Rates varied seasonally, however, with highest losses of propagules at the beginning of dispersal (July). Major predators were the mangrove crabs, Goniopsis cruentata and Ucides cordatus The high predation rate on A, germinans propagules was attributed to a relatively small size (facilitating burial in crab burrows), a higher nutritive content, and lower amounts of defensive chemicals such as tannins. Interspecific differences in predation rates, however, could not explain the relative dominance and spacial distribution of two of the three species that comprise this intertidal community. Comparison of predation rates in forest locations dominated by either R. mangle or A. germinans demonstrated that consumption of R, mangle propagules was highest in areas where it dominated the canopy and lowest where A, germinans was dominant. Predation also could nor account for the infrequent occurrence of L, racemosa trees at Twin Gays, since rates of propagule consumption were not different from that of R. mangle and significantly less than that of A. germinans. High densities of L. racemosa seedlings further suggested that predators were not preventing this species' establishment here. Only the predation pattern for A. germinans was consistent with intertidal dominance of trees. The results indicate that differential predation plays a less important role in the zonation of these island mangrove forests than has been reported for other geographic regions.

AB Germination trials were carried our on surface and buried soil samples from the Krakatau islands, with the aim of characterizing the nature and variability of the short-term seed bank and the potential significance of long-term subsurface seed storage. Thirty-six species of seed plants representing the Krakatau flora germinated from the samples. The topsoil samples yielded the largest number of seedlings and species, and had a faster pace of germination. These samples were found to be locally similar to each other but disharmonic with the extant vegetation. Seeds germinated both from samples buried by land crabs and from soils buried by layers of volcanic ash deposited ca 1930-33 and 1952-53. Eleven species of seed plants germinated from four samples buried ca 1930-33, indicating that these seeds survived burial by volcanic ash for ca 60 years.

AB Vines are significant components of rain forests, yet their role in succession has received little attention. Changes in vine communities on the Krakatau Islands, Indonesia, during the last 111 years provide an insight into colonizational patterns in a regenerating tropical rain forest. In surveys of Krakatau between 1979 and 1992, 71 species of plants that may be described as having a vining growth habit are identified out of a total of 306 spermatophytes (i.e., 23% of the flora). Most vines on Krakatau are hermaphrodite, approximately 24.6 percent are dioecious, and just 3.7 percent are monoecious. All the vines are insect-pollinated, but the proportion of wind-, animal- and sea-dispersed vines varies according to the recent history of the islands. Rakata, the least disturbed island in the group carries the greatest diversity of vines and the highest proportion of sea-dispersed species. As with many island biotas the vine flora of Krakatau is a disharmonic subset of the mainland (southeast Asian) pool and certain families, e.g., Annonaceae, Apocynaceae, Bignoniaceae, are relatively under- or unrepresented.

AB The obligate mutualism between rigs and their species-specific pollinator wasps has been thought to be relatively fragile in the face of population fluctuations of either mutualist. Here we report on the recovery of a Florida fig pollination mutualism devastated by Hurricane Andrew in August 1992. Damage to Ficus aurea included loss of all leaves and fruits and many branches, as well as the presumed local extinction of its pollinator Pegoscapus jimenezi. Within five months, however, fig flowering plenology and fig wasp abundance (measured by the number of pollinators entering inflorescences) had recovered to near prehurricane levels. Unusual phenological traits of F. aurea may have aided in the rapid reestablishment of pollinator populations; in addition, the wasps may have previously underappreciated capacities for long distance movements. This study suggests chat obligate interactions can be surprisingly resilient to certain population-level catastrophes.

AB Stomach contents of five syntopic, obligate army-ant-following birds (Gymnopithys salvini, Rhegmatorbina melanosticta, Myrmeciza fortis, Phlegopsis nigromaculata, and Dendrocincla merula) from a site in depto. Pando, Bolivia, were studied. The species studied are highly intra- and interspecifically aggressive and are similar in foraging behavior. Diet composition and prey size differed little among species and were in general unrelated to trophic morphological characters or dominance status. Stomachs of dominant species, however, had greater numbers of prey items than stomachs of subdominants; this was the major dietary difference discovered within this obligate ant-following assemblage. The opportunistic resource-use pattern of these species is similar to that of other groups of species, such as some carrion or fruit-eaters, or temperate-zone insectivores during resource flushes, that rely on temporally or spatially superabundant resources. It differs from predictions based on bill length or body size.

AB We examined natural abundances of C-13 in vegetation and soil organic matter (SOM) of subtropical wet and rain forests to characterize the isotopic enrichment through decomposition that has been reported for temperate forests. Soil cores and vegetative samples from the decomposition continuum (leaves, new litter, old litter, wood, and roots) were taken from each of four forest types in the Luquillo Experimental Forest, Puerto Rico. SOM delta(13)C was enriched 1.6 parts per thousand relative to aboveground liner. We found no further enrichment within the soil profile. The carbon isotope ratios of vegetation varied among forests, ranging from -28.2 parts per thousand in the Colorado forest to -26.9 parts per thousand in the Palm forest. Isotope ratios of SOM differed between forests primarily in the top 20 cm where the Colorado forest was again most negative at -28.0 parts per thousand, and the Palm forest was most positive at -26.5 parts per thousand. The isotopic differences between forests are likely attriburable to differences in light regimes due to canopy density variation, soil moisture regimes, and/or recycling of CO2. Our data suggest that recalcitrant SOM is not derived directly from plant lignin since plant lignin is even more C-13 deplered than the bulk vegetation. We hypothesize that the anthropogenic isotopic depletion of atmospheric CO2 (ca 1.5 parts per thousand in the last 150 years) accounts for some of the enrichment observed in the SOM relative to the more modern vegetation in this study and others. This study also supports other observations that under wet or anaerobic soil environments there is no isotopic enrichment during decomposition or with depth in the active profile.

AB We measured spatial variation of important abiotic and biotic factors inflencing landslide regeneration, contrasted variation among transects and microhabitats within a landslide with variation between two landslides, and tested for spatial gradients and patches in those factors. In addition, we performed multiple regression, principal components analysis, and canonical correspondense analysis to identify those factors important in defining patch structure and to investigate their ability to predict the current vegetative structure. We found that total daily photosynthetic photon flux density was 50 times greater in the landslide compared to the surrounding forest, but similar between landslides. The red:far red ratio was homogenous in the open areas of the landslides, but in areas covered by vegetation it was similar to those ratios found in the forest border. The soil had average extractable phosphorus of 0.108 g/m(2) to 9 cm depth. Nitrogen was .10 percent of average soil mass, carbon was 1.83 percent of average soil mass, and there was a 69 percent average moisture content. Seed rain averaged 31 seeds per trap with the seed pool showing an average of two seedlings per sample. Vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi covered 7 percent of the average length of roots sampled, and the vegetation (dominated by species Cyathea arborea, Cecropia schreberiana, Miconia spp., and Nepsera acuatica) had two structural levels on average. For these factors, the strongest gradient was from the forest into the landslides from the side rather than from she top of the landslide to the bottom or between landslides. Evidence of distinct patches was found where patch structure was defined by levels of light, seed pool, fungi, vegetation, soil N, and soil C. In addition, light, the key abiotic factor, showed very significant negative correlations with the key biotic factors of mycorrhizal fungi and vegetation, implying causal relationships.

AB Mangrove forests in Ecuador are disappearing due to pressure from a growing human population and conversion to shrimp ponds for the export market. There is a need to develop sustainable timber management techniques to preserve the remaining forests; especially important is the ability of forests to regenerate naturally after logging. In ten replicated 0.4 ha (30 x 120 m) plots clearcut 3 years prior to this study, seedling densities were high within 5 m of seed trees, in plots surrounded by trees >25 cm DBH, and in plots frequently inundated by tides. Interstitial soil salinity (23.3-26.3 ppt) and litter cover were not correlated with seedling density. Our results suggest that for natural regeneration to be sufficient for stand regeneration, logged areas should be no wider than 20 m and logging should be confined to forests with an average DBH >25 cm. In sites inundated by tides <20 times/month, seed trees should be retained at 20 m spacing.

Flowering began in August and extended to mid-December with the highest concentration of open inflorescences (>50% of the total) occurring from mid-Occober until mid-November. There was a significant correlation (Spearman rank correlation coefficient; r = 0.69; N = 8; P = 0.05) between flowering time and fruit set over the course of the reproductive season. The inflorescences that opened in October were chose that produced highest fruit set, with fruit set mean of 25.4 percent (SD = 20.9) in the first half and 28.9 percent (SD = 24.4) in the second half of October. Overall, fruit set was less than 10.0 percent, although it ranged from 0 to 85.0 percent. Each infructescence produced about: 60 fruits, but it ranged from 0 to 271 fruits. Fruit fall occurred for 6 to 10 months, generally concentrated from October to January.

AB Root system development of planted and sown seedlings of Swietenia macrophylla King (broad-leaf mahogany) was studied in abandoned pasture and secondary forest in former tropical dry forest in Guanacaste Conservation Area, Costa Rica. Differences between and within secondary dry forest habitats were assumed to cause differences in biomass allocation. Biomass allocation, root/shoot (R/S) ratio, root surface area/leaf area, rooting depth and the root specialization (tap root/total root system), were measured on 5, 13, 29 and 32 month-old seedlings. The youngest seedling groups harvested had been sown directly in the field, while the two oldest age groups had been grown in a nursery and transplanted to the field at three to four months of age. The field conditions were abandoned (Hyparrhenia rufa Stapf) pasture with mown and unmown grass and semi-evergreen secondary forest with normal and with reduced root competition under both thinned and unthinned forest canopy. Seedling biomass was lower in the secondary forest than in the pasture. Biomass was higher in mown than in unmown pasture. In the secondary forest, light availability rather than reduced root competition promoted biomass investment. R/S ratio did not increase by increasing light levels in the forest. A tendency of an increase in R/S ratio and root specialization was found with increasing seedling age, suggesting the importance of uptake and storage organs.

AB Epiphytic and tree-phase individuals of two hemiepiphytic figs (Ficus pertusa and F. trigonata) growing in a seasonally dry palm savanna in central Venezuela were compared on the bases of leaf longevity and temporal patterns of leaf production and loss. Epiphytic plants of both species produced new leaves more often and had a greater number of transitions from leaf-bearing to leafless than conspecific trees during the two-year observation period. Leaf production by epiphytic plants but not by trees of either species was positively correlated with rainfall received during the fortnight prior to phenological observation. Epiphytic plants of both species were leafless or nearly so during more of the year and had more separate episodes of becoming deciduous than conspecific trees. Periods of leaf loss generally coincided with dry periods but the negative correlation with rainfall during the previous fortnight was significant only for F. pertusa trees. Leaf life spans were shorter on epiphytic than on tree-phase figs. Patterns of leaf production and loss are interpreted to be responses to water deficits suffered by epiphytes, deficits that are at least partially overcome when plants becomes deeply rooted in the ground.

AB The levels of seed set and aborted seeds, ovules, and flowers and fruits were determined in 232 species of planes in relation to inflorescence type, inflorescence position, synchronization of anthesis within the inflorescence and the pollination unit, and the combination of these variables. The percentage of variance between the levels of aborted ovules, aborted flowers and fruits, and seed set was significantly greater for inflorescence type than the other variables. The percentage of variance explained by different groups of variables (grouped by cluster analysis) in the abortion levels and seed set does not differ from that of the individual variables. The lowest levels of aborted seeds occur in spadices, as well as in axillary and terminal/axillary inflorescences. The lowest levels of aborted ovules and the highest levels of seed set occurred in terminal, capituliform inflorescences. The lowest levels of flower-fruit abortion were found in solitary flowers and in terminal, capituliform inflorescences, and in synchronous anthesis. There was a general tendency in this sample for low levels of abortion and high seed sec to be associated with the low cost of fruits and individual seeds in inflorescence units. These results are interpreted on the basis of the biomass assigned to flowers, fruits, and seeds, as well as particular characteristics of the qualitative characters.

AB Hummingbird Bower mites consume nectar and pollen in the flowers they inhabit and are transported on hummingbirds. This study, conducted at La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica, measured the effects of the mite Proctolaelaps kirmsei (Gamasina: Ascidae) and of pollinating hummingbirds on nectar volume of Hamelia patens (Rubiaceae), by replicated exclusion experiments. The mites consume, on average, some 40 percent of the nectar produced by Bowes, when hummingbirds are excluded. Mites and hummingbirds together consume about 85 percent of the nectar. Individual trees in the study differed significantly and independently in both nectar production and mice population density. These results help establish hummingbird flower mites as significant plant parasites-especially considering their concomitant role as voracious consumes of pollen (Paciorek et al. 1995)-as well as important competitors with hummingbirds for the nectar of their host plants. Published estimates of nectar production races in mite host plants may be seriously in error, unless mites were excluded.

AB In Hong Kong, che mangrove Avicennia marina (Forsk.) Vierh. experiences incense herbivory every summer such that within 3 months all trees are defoliated. Rapid regeneration of the canopy follows, but reproductive output is severely impaired as defoliation coincides with flowering. The causal herbivore is the caterpillar of Nephopterix syntaractis Turner (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), as demonstrated in investigations of caterpillar densities and leaf consumption rates. The effect of N. syntaractis on leaf area damaged, leaf tannin content, and reproductive output of A. marina was investigated by applying insecticide over trees in marked plots. In comparison with the control plot, spraying reduced leaf damaged and increased flower and propagule production in the treated stand. Tannin levels showed no increase with level of leaf damage but did differ between sprayed and control plots, reflecting a raised tannin content of regenerated leaves. The consequences of defoliation of the stand are discussed.

AB In response to tactile stimulation and to ultrasonic pulses such as those of attacking bats, many moths of the family Arctiidae produce ultrasonic clicks. To test the hypothesis that these clicks are aposematic sounds, warning bats of unpalatable prey, African moths of these two families were captured at lights, assayed for clicking responses to tactile and ultrasonic stimulation and placed, together with moths of similar body sizes and other families captured at the same time, in a small cage with sympatric Tadarida pumila bats. Arctiid fragments were sought among the insect remains (mostly moth wings) dropped by free-foraging Hipposideros caffer bats. There were no arctiid wings among them, and the captive bats ate a significantly larger proportion of control moths than arctiids. There were no significant differences by species or sex in the arctiids' clicking responses to either stimulus or in their palatability to bats. Since the arctiids did click in response to bat-like stimuli and were dearly less palatable to the bats than the control moths, we conclude that the sounds of these moths can act as aposematic sounds.

AB The toads belonging to the Bufo margaritifera complex (Amphibia: Anura; Bufonidae) are widely distributed in the Neotropics. A molecular analysis, using the quantitative immunological technique of micro-complement fixation, assessed the degree of divergence in a plasma protein, serum albumin, among representative Central and South American toads currently placed in this complex. This analysis revealed a surprisingly large amount of genetic diversity. Comparisons of estimates of albumin sequence evolution in representatives of the Bufo margaritifera complex from 32 localities in one central and seven South American countries indicate that this complex includes more than three lineages that are very distinct genetically but show relatively little morphological variation. The degree of albumin divergence implies that some of these lineages have been isolated for at least 30 million years. This study also suggests that the amount of genetic diversity within other Amazonian species or species groups could be substantial.

AB A heath community found on Pulau Sibu, an island lying off the east cease of Peninsular Malaysia, was found to consist of a low scrub, generally under 2 m in height, containing 24 species of vascular planes growing on hills overlooking the sea. It grew on a very shallow and acidic (pH 4.3) soil that was low in coral nitrogen concentration (0.2%). Leaves of the seven most common shrub species, Ixonanthes reticulata, Melastoma malabathricum, rhodamnia cinerea, rhodomyrtus tomentosa, Schima wallichii, Styphelia malayana and tristaniopsis obovata, were collected for morphological, anatomical, and chemical analysis. The community was characterized by very small leaves (a dominance of microphylls), with very low nitrogen, phosphorus and total chlorophyll concentrations, and chlorophyll a/b ratio. Lamina thickness, specific leaf area, crude fiber content and potassium concentrations were less extreme. A number of the species in the community are generally considered to be early successional, but no strong evidence could be found for any recent disturbance event that would have initiated the production of a seral community.

AB Accumulations of organic material can be found in the crowns of trees in tropical wet forests. We investigated moisture and temperature patterns of dead organic matter in the canopy and of soil in the upper horizons of the forest floor over a 42-month period. Temperatures of the canopy material and forest floor soil fluctuated throughout the year (range = 11.5 degrees C to 21.0 degrees C), but remained within an average of 1 degrees C of each other. Both canopy material and forest floor soils were moist throughout the wet and misty seasons (over 70% water content). Although canopy organic substrate experienced periods of rapid and severe dehydration during the dry season (20%-40% water content), forest floor soils remained at a consistently high water content (60%-70%). The more extreme and fluctuating moisture conditions of canopy organic material may be important in determining the distribution and activity of epiphytic plants and associated canopy organisms.

AB The mangrove community of the Neotropics shows a progressive increase in diversity through the Cenozoic. Palynofloras from the early Eocene similar to 50 Ma (million years ago) indicate chat brackish-water coastal areas were occupied by four principal genera-Acrostichum, the extinct Brevitricolpites variabilis, Nypa, and Pelliceria (Pellicera). Avicennia is first reported in the late Miocene similar to 10 Ma. Extinctions, introductions, and adaptations varied the composition and increased net diversity to six mangrove and three associated genera by the middle Pliocene (similar to 3.5 Ma)-Acrostichum, Avicennia, Crenea, Laguncularia, Pelliceria, Rhizophora; acacia, Hampea/Hibiscus, and Pachira. Modernization continued in the Quaternary with the first microfossils of Conocarpus, and with the addition of eight possible associates, for a total of 15 genera. Twelve others, unknown as fossils, were added during the Cenozoic to constitute the present-day community of similar to 27 genera of mangroves and associates. The fossil record identifies a trend of increasing diversity that can be assessed as new assemblages are studied, and provides a first quantitative estimate of Neotropical history through the Cenozoic Era.

AB Plant species composition and standing crop in relation to soil and water characteristics were studied to determine which environmental variables are responsible for structure and distribution of marshes in northern Belize. Sampling sites were located in the floodplains of the Rio Hondo and New River and within karstic depressions in the interfluves of the two rivers. Relationships among environmental variables and the occurrence of the individual marsh types, in particular those dominated by Cladium jamaicense, Eleocharis cellulosa, and Typha domingensis were investigated using canonical correspondence analysis. Discriminant analysis was used to select a reduced set of variables for predicting the distribution of dominant species. Eleocharis cellulosa marshes dominated areas with soil and water of high conductivity due to high content of gypsum and calcium carbonate. Nutrient concentrations, namely nitrogen and phosphorus, were very low. Conditions were rather similar in sawgrass marshes (Cladium jamaicense), except for higher water depth and lower conductivity. Marshes dominated by Typha domingensis occupied areas with higher content of nitrogen and phosphorus. Discriminant functions developed for these three marsh communities can be used to help interpret paleoecological data and infer ancient Maya impacts upon marsh development.

AB Carex runssoroensis,, a tussock-forming sedge, is a dominant of peatlands endemic to the alpine zone of several East African mountains. Species composition, vertical structure, interspecific associations, plant biomass, plant and soil nutrient content, and redox potential were assessed in Carex runssoroensis fens from comparable altitudes on Ruwenzoti Mountains and Mount Elgon. Fens from Mount Elgon exhibit higher species richness, more pronounced vertical structure, higher density of smaller tussocks, and lower content of nitrogen in the biomass. Ruwenzori fens are characterized by a smaller number of species, large Carex tussocks with higher nitrogen content and intervening hollows with a high proportion of mosses. The differences seem to be related to different climatic conditions in the two mountains: Mount Elgon is generally drier, with occasional fires burning even through peatlands; whereas, the Ruwenzori Mountains are more humid, resulting in almost constant flooding of some local peatlands.

AB Owing to differences in morphology and growth rates among tree species, monospecific tree stands may differ in their ability to suppress the growth of understory plants through shading and root competition. I assessed relative understory suppression and intensity of root competition in year-old stands of Cordia alliodora, Hyeronima alchorneoides, and Cedrela odorata by measuring the growth of seedlings of the pioneer tree Piper auritum and cuttings of the shade-tolerant shrub P. phtolaccaefolium that were planted into trenched and untrenched sites under the trees. After 5 mo, growth of P. auritum was significantly less under Cordia and Hyeronima than under Cedrela or in the open. The most severe growth reductions occurred under Hyeronima, the species with the highest leaf area index (LAI). Lack of a significant trenching response under Hyeronima suggests the competitive effects of this species were largely the result of shading, In contrast, the competitive effects of Cordia, a species with relatively high fine root density and open canopy, were almost entirely below ground. Nonetheless, the effects of Cordia and Hyeronima on the growth of P. auritum seedlings were equivalent when compared on a per-unit of tree canopy LAI basis. Lack of P. auritum growth suppression under Cedrela is likely the result of the open canopies and relatively low fine root densities of the Cedrela stands. In contrast to the growth of P. auritum, P. phytolaccaefolium growth did not differ among tree overstories. These results suggest that, among tree species, differences in morphology can lead to differences in understory suppression, but these differences depend upon the understory species.

AB Research on epiphyte (9 bromeliads and 1 orchid) relationships with host trees, and with arthropods, especially ants, was undertaken in the low inundated forest of Quintana Roo, Mexico.
   Epiphyte association with host trees is determined by the interaction of the epiphyte seed type and dispersal mode with the bark type of the host. Airborne seeds of the Tillandsia spp, are caught on the rough-barked and small, spiny branches of Bucida spinosa; flat, ovoid seeds of Aechmea bracteata, which are disseminated by birds, germinate principally on Haematoxylum campechianum and Erythroxylum confusum, two rough-barked tree species, often in forks of major branches, and never on B. spinosa; the minute seeds of Schomhurgkia tibicinis germinate generally on E. confusum, but also on Manilkara zaposa and rarely on B. spinosa.
   Epiphyte association with non-ant arthropods is determined principally by the size and shape of the cavities. Most of the arthropods, including aquatic insects, are detritivores feeding on rotten debris which collects in the reservoirs of bromeliads. Also, some animals utilize epiphytes only as shelter.
   Epiphyte association with ants is largely correlated with the size and shape of the cavities. Intermediate steps between the ''phytotelm'' type and the ''myrmecophytic'' type were determined in the genus Tillandsia. The best rate of occupation by ants (96% of the ramets sheltered ants) was obtained by A. bracteata of the ''phytotelm tank'' type (reservoir in peripheric cavities, but also a waterproof central cavity), while the best rate of ant diversity was observed in T. bulbosa (''myrmecophytic'' type; 26 ant species).
   Ants sheltered in the bromeliads were shown to protect host trees against defoliation by an undetermined chrysomelid beetle and the leaf-cutting ant Atta cephalotes.

AB The effects of shoot damage on starch concentrations in large roots and lower boles of the tropical timber tree, Cedrela adorata, were measured over a 30-day period following mechanical shoot removal. The degree of damage was based on amounts typically destroyed by Hypsipyla grandella, a serious lepidopteran pest of C. odorata. From 14-month-old plantations at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica, three treatments were established based on the length of shoot and number of leaves removed: controls (no tissue removed), moderate damage, and severe damage. Initial starch concentrations were compared with concentrations observed 18 to 30 days following shoot removal using enzymatic starch hydrolysis and colorimetry. Root starch concentrations increased in undamaged trees, decreased slightly in the moderately damaged trees, and decreased markedly in severely damaged trees during the sampling period. Starch concentrations in lower boles did not decrease following shoot damage, suggesting a specific role of root search reserves in responding to aboveground carbon requirements. The dry weights of regrown shoots were similar for the moderately and severely damaged trees, but severely damaged trees produced numerous basal shoots while moderately damaged trees produced only one or two terminal shoots near the point of excision. Decreases in root search concentrations following shoot damage and rapid shoot regrowth suggest that starch remobilization in roots of C. odorata might provide a survival mechanism after attack by H. grandella.

AB Discrete (i.e., one-time) measurements of the levels of herbivore damage on the foliage of trees (16 species) were made for three consecutive years in the Chamela dry forest. There was a marked similarity in the overall levels of damage despite the fact that there were considerable climatic differences among years and that some of the species showed at least one significant among-year difference.
   In one of the three years of study, long-term measurements of damage (i,e., on individually marked leaves) were also made to assess within-year variation (by calculating the races of herbivory early and late in the wet season) and to assess the reliability of che discrete measurements. With this type of measurement the mean leaf area loss of the studied species was 17 percent. This value is higher than the values commonly reported for tropical forests. An outstanding example of defoliation was that of Jatropha standleyi, with 73 percent leaf area eaten.
   There was a very marked within-season variation in the rates of herbivory: during the early parr of the rainy season the mean race (0.352% leaf area eaten per day) was considerably higher chan lace in the season (0.097). Analyses of leaf nitrogen and water content early and late in the season indicated chat these components of the nutritional quality of the foliage decrease as the season progresses.
   The discrete measurements of herbivory underestimated the true (long-term) values of leaf damage. A discrepancy ratio long-term/discrete measurement varied considerably among species with an overall mean of 1.99. Thus, in general, discrete measurements underestimated herbivory by half. It appears that che major cause of che underestimates of the discrete measurements is that the leaves of some species are eaten completely and thus missed in a one-rime measurement. Another disadvantage of the discrete measurements is chat information on che timing of damage is lost.
   This study showed that folivory is nor only concentrated to the season of leaf availability, but chat it occurs within an even more restricted period.

AB We measured the response of seed predators to variation in seed density and distance between seed sources of palms in North Queensland, Australia. Adult palm trees occurred at a density of 20/ha. Their distribution was highly dumped and more than half the immature plants occurred within 3 m of an adult. Adult palms were also arranged in lines down the slope, apparently reflecting patterns of seed carriage by overland water flow. Seed dispersal is also affected by cassowaries, a ratite which ranges over many hundreds of ha and deposits seeds in dusters. Small mammals which range over a few ha may deposit seeds as single entities (singletons). Many seeds remain undispersed beneath the female parent with heavy predation. In this study seeds were placed beneath adult trees at two densities and were dispersed over varying distances as clusters of ten seeds and as singletons. Pigs and earwigs were the principal predators but they did not destroy all the seeds in any treatment. However, the germination percentage of the remaining seeds was greatly depressed indicating that one or both predators were disproportionately selecting potential germinants. Pigs were responsive to both density of seeds beneath a tree and the distance between seed sources; they did not damage dispersed seeds to a great extent. Earwigs also destroyed seeds more heavily beneath adult trees, but they were more efficient than pigs at locating dispersed seeds. Rodent predation was light and not responsive to seed density or dispersal.

AB The fruiting phenology and avian consumer set of cardon cactus (Stenocereus griseus) fruits were observed on the semiarid Macanao Peninsula of Margarita Island, Venezuela. The cardon population had two peak fruiting seasons (late May-early June and late August-early September) which correspond to the local rainy seasons, bur many plants also produce low numbers of fruits throughout the year. Fruits were fed on continuously by a variety of consumers for several days while still attached to the plant. The avian consumer set included 14 species and was dominated by two species of parrots (Aratinga pertinax and the endangered Amazona barbadensis), Most of the avian consumers are omnivores that include variable amounts of fruit in their diet. Feeding observations in the wild, captive feeding trials, and seed germination trials indicated that six of the bird species are seed predators, six act as seed dispersers, and two are neutral with respect to seed survival. Bats fed on the fruits but were unable to open the husks, and thus must rely on naturally dehisced fruits or fruits opened by psittacines.

AB We review reports of leaf-eating by bats and present new evidence for folivory by leaf fractionation for the neotropical bat Artibeus jamaicensis (Chiroptera: Phyllostomidae). Leaf-earing has been reported for at least 17 species of Old-World Megachiroptera and four species of New World Microchiroptera. Leaves eaten by bats include at least 44 species of plants represented by 23 different families. Plane families which account for the greatest species richness (numbers of species given in parentheses) include the Leguminosae (12), Moraceae (4), and Solanaceae (4). Evidence for folivory by A. jamaicensis is based on captures of bats carrying leaves, and collections of whole and partially chewed leaves and discarded pellets recovered from beneath feeding roosts. Whole leaves carried into caves by A. jamaicensis and partially chewed, but discarded leaves included Erythrina poeppigiana, Ficus sp., and Calophyllum calaba, in decreasing order of frequency. Bats captured while carrying Erythrina leaves were most often mature males. Erythrina poeppigiana leaves are relatively high in protein (>19% dry-matter content) and low in fat (similar to 1%). Our observations char A. jamaicensis selects and chews leaves high in protein and rejects protein-poor, fibrous pellets, support the hypothesis that these bats extract liquid fractions which contain a reliable source of dietary protein. Although we have no direct evidence that male or female A. jamaicensis transport leaves to feeding roosts located outside of caves, we suggest that liquid fractions derived from leaves may provide females with an important source of protein, especially during periods of pregnancy and lactation. Folivory, once thought to be rare among plant-visiting bats, may in fact be quite common and widespread, especially among species that feed largely on fruits which are low in protein.

Defecated seeds of several riparian plant species from R. funerea feces and defecated seeds of several terrestrial plant species, mainly characteristic of treefall areas, from R. annulata feces germinated as well as uningested seeds with which they were compared. The Rhinoclemmys funerea habit of regularly emerging from water to forage and defecate on river banks may contribute to the establishment of riparian species such as Dieffenbachia longispatha and Ficus glabrata. Rbinoclemmys annulata forages through tropical wet forest habitats, spending a disproportionate amount of time feeding in treefall areas. its movement between these areas and defecation of seeds while foraging in them may contribute to the establishment of the distinctive Bora of these small, disjunct habitats.

AB To better understand the physiognomy and dynamics of tropical forest canopy trees, the mortality, recruitment, and growth rates of trees greater-than-or-equal-to 30 cm DBH were quantified on a montane tropical rain forest hillslope over the 10-yr period 1982-1992.  The results indicate that the smaller stature of canopy trees growing on or near ridge-crests of montane rain forests is a consequence of higher turnover rates, not slower growth rates.  The annual canopy tree turnover rate of approximately 1.7 percent in the upslope section of the sample area was two times greater than in the downslope section.  The DBH growth increments in the upslope and downslope sections also were significantly different (P < 0.05), but it was the upslope trees that grew at the faster rate (upslope = 3.1 mm yr-1; downslope = 2.4 mm yr-1).  The mean DBH growth increment of 2.7 mm yr-1 for the entire plot is relatively high compared to other montane tropical rain forests.  Interspecific variation among the 23 tree species also was notable, with mean DBH increments ranging from 0.4 to 7.8 mm yr-1.  Ceratopetalum virchowii and Elaeocarpus ferruginiflorus were the most dominant species in 1982:  C. virchowii increased its dominance over the 10-year period with a higher rate of recruitment than mortality and a change in relative importance from 22.7 percent in 1982 to 28.4 percent in 1992; E. ferruginiflorus, in contrast, experienced the most significant change of all the species examined, with a decrease in relative importance from 14.1 percent in 1982 to 5.3 percent in 1992 as a result of its high mortality, its slow growth rates, and its failure to recruit any individuals into the greater-than-or-equal-to 30 cm DBH size-class; the local demise of this species may be part of a shifting floristic mosaic associated with natural disturbance events or perhaps part of an irreversible trend.  It is recommended that more attention be directed to the growth patterns of co-occurring species and the life histories of individual trees to obtain a clearer sense for the long-term dynamics of montane tropical rain forest canopy tree populations.

AB We compared soil phosphorus levels below canopies of the lowland tropical rain forest tree species Simarouba amara Aubl.  with soil sampled beyond the edge of S. amara canopies.  Our data show that trees affect soil phosphorus concentrations and that differences below individual trees are related to gender for this dioecious species.  Soil sampled adjacent to female trees had significantly higher soil phosphorus levels for several different indices of phosphorus availability than soil sampled beyond tree crowns.  Male trees did not significantly modify soil phosphorus levels.  Analysis of total mineral phosphorus (Total-phosphorus) below and beyond the canopies of male and female of S. amara found no differences in the total amount of phosphorous combined within bound and labile soil fractions.  We measured a small increase in soil organic matter under tree canopies, but found no gender-related difference.  Our results indicate that increased phosphorus availability beneath female S. amara arises from a gender-related modification in phosphorus cycling rather than from higher recruitment of females on sites rich in phosphorus or organic matter.  We suggest that gender-dependent controls on soil phosphorus may include below-canopy enrichment of available phosphorus due to fruit and litter cycling or increases in phosphorus transformation from bound to labile forms.

AB Vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizae can be indispensable for establishment and growth of tree seedlings in infertile lowland wet tropical soils.  Persistence of mycorrhizal fungi after disturbance, however, is problematic to assess.  We used a greenhouse bioassay employing Psidium guajava L. and Allium cepa L. to estimate the most probable number of mycorrhizal fungus propagules in two Costa Rican soils (Oxic Dystropepts) with different vegetation histories.  We collected soils at the La Selva Biological Station from sites in secondary forest, abandoned pasture, and plots kept bare of vegetation for four and six years.
   Both bioassay hosts yielded positively correlated estimates of mycorrhiza propagule numbers.  Median propagule estimates per 100 gm dry soil for the pasture site are 57 and 63; these estimates significantly exceed those for the other sites which range from 0.2 to 10 for bare plots and were estimated to be 0.6 and 10 for secondary forest.  These bioassay estimates are positively correlated (Pearson r = 0.66 and 0.72) with counts of whole spores in these soils, but not with counts of sporocarps, spore clusters, or the most numerous, spores apparently empty of cytoplasmic contents or parasitized.  Growth of both bioassay hosts in pasture soil significantly exceeded growth in soils from the other three sites in accord with the bioassays and whole spore counts.

AB Responses of a tree fern (Cibotium glaucum) to nutrient additions were examined in two rain forest sites in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, Hawaii.  In the younger forest (ca 200 yr old), separate additions of nitrogen and of phosphorus (but not additions of all other macro- and micronutrients) increased fern stem height growth.  Nitrogen but not phosphorus increased leaf production, but fertilization had no effect on maximum leaf longevity (39 mo).  In the older forest (> 1000 yr old), nitrogen additions did not alter fern growth parameters; fern stem height growth and leaf production were greater in unfertilized plots of the > 1000 yr old forest than in unfertilized plots in the younger forest; and leaf longevity (maximum of 34 mo) was shorter.  Leaf production (February-April) and leaf mortality (August-November) were highly seasonal, with mortality occurring several months after expansion of new leaves.  The asynchronous leaf recruitment and mortality resulted in cyclic monthly variability in leaves per fern.  Our data support other studies suggesting that more rapid leaf turnover occurs in nutrient-rich sites, and that nitrogen appears to be the nutrient most limiting to growth in the early stages of primary succession.

AB In February 1990, tropical cyclone Ofa struck Western Samoa with very strong winds (in excess of 200 km/hr).  In December 1991, less than 22 months later, tropical cyclone Val struck the same area with similar intensity.  In the moist lowland forest of the Tafua Rain Forest Reserve, Savai'i, Western Samoa, we examined the effects of the two cyclones on forest structure, tree mortality, and interspecific differences in damage.  Average mortality of trees was high after both cyclones (28% and 33%, respectively).  In one forest area, subject to a fire after the first storm, mortality was more than 90 percent.
   The frequency of uprooted trees was 31 percent after Ofa, but only 16 percent after Val. Uprooting was significantly more frequent among species lacking buttresses or stilt roots.  As a combined effect of the two cyclones, the lowland forest of Tafua suffered a 53 percent tree mortality, with remaining standing trees being severely damaged (topped and with a substantial reduction of main branches).  Average tree density dropped from an estimated 476 trees/ha (>5 cm DBH), before Ofa to 225 trees/ha after Val.  Existent gap sizes are reflected by the changes in mean canopy cover which decreased from nearly 100 percent before Ofa to 27 percent after Val.
   Post-cyclone recovery is often observed to be very rapid, but the very large gaps created in the Tafua forest and the simultaneous loss of the whole guild of vertebrate seed dispersers (flying foxes and fruit pigeons) suggests it will be a long time before the upper canopy is once again closed.

AB The floristics and nutrient relations of the vegetation on landslides 15 yr old and > 50 yr old were studied in a montane rain forest.  A total of 33 species were recorded on the 15-yr-old sites and 50 species on the > 50-yr-old sites.  The dominant woody species on all sites was Clethra occidentalis; fast-growing pioneer species characteristic of the forest edge were generally absent.  Vegetation development on these sites was slow.  On the 15-yr-old sites almost all individuals were <1 m in stem length, and on older landslides all individuals were < 5 m in stem length.  For 15-yr-old sites, harvested aboveground biomass ranged between 350 and 820 g/m2, 79 percent of which was accounted for by a nitrogen-fixing lichen.  On the oldest landslides, biomass ranged between 970 and 4690 g/m2 and was accounted for primarily by woody plants.  Foliar concentrations of N, P, K, and Ca all increased (P < 0.01, data for all species combined) from the 15-yr-old to the older sites.

AB I collected 99 scats of Philander opossum and 73 of Didelphis marsupialis in the Chajul region of the Selva Lacandona rain forest of Chiapas, Mexico.  The objective was to evaluate the role of these didelphids as dispersers of seeds of Cecropia obtusifolia Bertol.  (Moraceae).  Didelphis marsupialis disperses more seeds and more frequently than P. opossum (69.9% of scats with seeds and a mean of 501 seeds per scat vs 56.6% and a mean of 218 seeds, respectively).  Dispersal distances (measured from the capture site to the nearest adult tree) varied from 0 to 71 m (mean = 14.5 m) for P. opossum and from 0 to 61.5 m (mean = 13.3 m) for D. marsupialis.  Most dispersal events consisted of few seeds dispersed short distances, and there never were events of many seeds dispersed long distances.  The leptokurtic distribution of the data agrees with those in literature for the dispersal of this and other species of pioneer trees.  Given the habits of didelphids and their habitat use patterns, probably these species provide an important and advantageous seed dispersal vector for C. obtusifolia by dropping seeds in sites adequate for germination.

AB The recruitment pattern of Vouacapoua americana (Caesalpiniaceae) and the relationship between growth and survival of recruits were analyzed from 1984 to 1991 on two 2500 m2 plots, one with and one without free soil drainage.  Most seeds and seedlings below two adult trees in the plots died within 6 to 8 months of establishment.  Virtually all seedlings still alive several months after fruiting arose from seeds that were buried by scatterhoarding rodents.  Because rodents do not disperse seeds a great distance and Vouacapoua seedlings survive well in the shaded understory, offspring recruitment was more dense near adults than further away.  A significantly lower proportion of newly established seedlings died on freely drained soil than where drainage was blocked; mortality was due to ''damping-off' from fungal attack.  First-year survival of seedlings from scatterhoarded seeds and growth rates for understory seedlings from 1984 to 1986 were higher on freely drained soil than on blocked soil.  Long-term offspring survival was similar on both plots, while height increment was significantly greater on the freely drained plots than on the poorly drained soil.  There was a significant negative relationship between the initial seedling density and proportion of survival on both plots within 6-8 months of establishment.  However, there was no evidence of long-term compensatory mortality; the greater the initial density, the greater the final density of recruits surviving through years.  The Vouacapoua recruitment pattern appears typical of a partially repelled syndrome with recruits growing both near adults and further away.  High Vouacapoua tree density on soil with good drainage, as reported in the literature, is likely to result from better environmental conditions for early seedling survival and long-term growth of recruits.

AB Predation by rodents on seeds of Scheelea zonensis was studied on Barro Colorado Island, Panama, during the latter half of this palm's fruiting season.  The number of Scheelea bearing fruit declined steadily during this period.  The proportion of both intact and bruchid-infested seeds among those accumulated under fruiting Scheelea declined, while the proportion of gnawed seeds increased.  By early October, 87 percent of the Scheelea seeds sampled had been gnawed by rodents, and few intact or bruchid-infested seeds remained below parent palms.  From August through October, agoutis, Dasyprocta punctata, visited Scheelea less and less frequently, while visits by squirrels, Sciurus granatensis, did not decline.  To learn the fate of late-falling Scheelea seeds, we placed small piles of thread-marked seeds, each similar to a small Scheelea fruit crop, in the forest during three successive months, a total of 400 seed each month.  Of these 1200 thread-marked seeds, 57.2 percent were retrieved within 20 m of their piles 7 days after placement.  Of the retrieved seeds, 22.2 percent were gnawed within 1 m of their pile, 70.6 percent were carried between 1 and 20 m before gnawing, and 7.2 percent were cached (not gnawed, but buried in the ground or covered with litter).  More seeds were gnawed, and fewer cached, in September and October than in August.  On Barro Colorado Island, intense seed predation by rodents on Scheelea correlates with a previously documented forestwide low in availability of fruits of all kinds, and with a decline in egg laying by bruchids.

AB Nocturnal Sphingidae (hawkmoths or sphinx moths) are important pollinators in tropical forests.  Hawkmoth flowers are typically white to the human eye.  As the retinas of hawkmoths contain ultraviolet-sensitive photoreceptors, flower patterns reflecting ultraviolet wavelengths (that are not visible to humans) might be significant to sphingid feeding behavior.  The flowers of ten hawkmoth-pollinated species were examined with an ultraviolet sensitive video system in Monteverde, Costa Rica.  All were found to lack ultraviolet reflectance.  A common hawkmoth species, Manduca sexta, whose range extends to Costa Rica was then used in liaboratory free choice experiments to determine which wavelengths elicited proboscis extension, probing and drinking of sugar water.  When offered a choice between artificial flowers or backlighted filters, Manduca strongly preferred to feed at those reflecting or transmitting only wavelengths longer than 400 nm, avoiding those that also included ultraviolet wavelengths.  That is, feeding behavior was best elicited by stimuli that mimicked the reflectance of typical hawkmoth flowers.  Feeding behavior must be primarily activated by either the green- or violet-sensitive mechanisms (or both) of the hawkmoth visual system, while concurrent activation of the ultraviolet-sensitive mechanism interferes with it.

AB Male tiger beetles continue to ride in amplexus on the backs of females after copulation.  In scrub forest of peninsular India, the duration of this post-copulatory behavior was significantly different among five syntopic, congeneric species.  Field and laboratory tests showed generally that males were present in the mating area at a higher proportion than females and that males remained mounted on females significantly longer when another male was present than when pairs were alone.  These results are consistent with the interpretation of this amplexus as mate guarding.  Four tests of comparative behavioral and ecological conditions were then used to explain the differential duration of amplexus observed among these co-occurring tiger beetle species: operational sex ratios, harassment and potential displacement of mating pair by unmated males, duration of female stay in mating area following copulation, and distance between mating area and oviposition site.  Species differences in duration of female stay in the mating area after copulation and to a lesser degree operational sex ratios predicted amplexus duration for three of the species.  The distance between mating area and oviposition site predicted the amplexus duration of the final two species.  Probability of disruption by unmated males and frequency of male displacement during mating had little or no relation to any of the species differences in amplexus duration.

AB Census results and observations of foraging tactics and diet were compiled for the 35 regularly occurring species of diurnal raptors in an 800-ha section of the lowland Manu National Park of southeastern Peru.  Census results show that most forest raptors occurred across a broad array of successional stages.  Population densities ranged from a high of one or two territories per 100 ha (e.g., Micrastur forest-falcons, double-toothed kite, Harpagus bidentatus) to lows of much less than one territory in the entire study area (e.g., large eagles).  A species replacement apparently occurs in the genus Leucopternis, with the slate-colored hawk L. schistacea occupying flood plain forest and the white-browed hawk L. kuhli occupying upland forest.  All other congeners showed substantial overlap in habitat use.  Based on observations by 35 researchers of over 400 prey items being carried and over 200 attacks, I divided raptors into several preliminary guilds.  Forest raptors include seven species that hunt arthropods and small vertebrates from concealed perches (e.g., Micrastur forest-falcons, gray-headed kite, Leptodon cayanensis); seven species that hunt large birds and mammals either from concealed perches (e.g., ornate hawk-eagle, Spizaetus ornatus) or on long-range attacks on sites where birds or mammals aggregate (e.g., bicolored hawk, Accipiter bicolor); and several species with specialized diets of wasps (red-throated caracara, Daptrius americanus), snails (hook-billed kite, Chondrohierax uncinatus), and snakes (laughing falcon, Herpetotheres cachinnans).  Species that hunt on the wing include four that feed mostly on flying insects and small vertebrates (two kites, the short-tailed hawk Buteo brachyurus, and the bat falcon Falco rufigularis), one that dives on perched vertebrates (zone-tailed hawk Buteo albonotatus), and two vultures that search for carrion. Raptors of open rivers, lakes, and marshes include a fish specialist (the osprey Pandion haliaetus), two snail specialist kites, a carrion-eating vulture, a Buteo that dives on arthropods and small vertebrates, and three species with extremely diverse diets (e.g., black-collared hawk, Busarellus nigricollis).  Snail specialists tended to occur irregularly during the eleven field seasons of this study.  Several raptors are known to influence the population dynamics of their prey species.  Large forest-dwelling raptors such as the harpy and crested eagles are likely to require the largest preserves.

AB I determined rates of acetylene reduction and estimated rates of nitrogen fixation in three sites that varied in soil age and nitrogen accumulation on Kilauea Volcano, Hawai'i. The major substrates in which acetylene reduction occurred were lichens of the genus Stereocaulon, liverworts, decaying leaf litter, and decaying wood. Estimated rates of nitrogen fixation were 0.3, 1.2, and 2.8 kg.ha-1.yr-1 in an open-canopied 27 yr old site, a 200 yr old primary successional montane rain forest, and an approximately 2000 yr old montane rain forest, respectively. The sum of nitrogen fixed by these sources plus nitrogen inputs in precipitation was insufficient to explain the quantity of nitrogen accumulated in the 200 yr old site.

DE DRY TROPICAL FOREST; FLORAL COMPOSITION; FOREST STRUCTURE; MADAGASCAR
AB For this paper, we sampled a fenced and an unprotected portion of a dry gallery forest (the Beza Mahafaly Reserve) in southwestern Madagascar for structure and floristic composition. Seedling plots were also sampled to assess invasion and regeneration. A total of 923 plants greater-than-or-equal-to 2.5 cm diameter at breast height (DBH) were censused in 25 transects. Sixty-nine species and 43 genera were represented. In plant density, diversity, and size classes of individuals, the forest is similar to many continental tropical dry forests in Africa and the Neotropics. Over 80 percent of those species identified were native, as were 26 percent of the genera. Unlike many insular forests, Beza Mahafaly is not being invaded by fast-growing exotic species. There were no noticable differences in density, diversity, size classes, or proportion of native species between transects within and outside of the protected reserve.
   Two distinct microhabitats were noticed. Individual plants were more dense on ''drier'' soils; whereas, large trees greater-than-or-equal-to 25 cm DBH were over twice as frequent on ''wetter'' soils. The floristic composition also differed, with only two species of tree, Tamarindus indica and Azima tetracantha, being common to both habitats. The distribution and density of lemur populations within the forest appear to be directly related to microhabitat differences.

AB We examined patterns of mortality from long-term (up to 25 yr) forest inventory data collected from 17 0.25-ha plots representing mature tropical lowland moist forest and tropical lower montane moist forest life zones in Venezuela. Annual mortality rates varied greatly among plots and differed when mortality was calculated on a frequency basis (% stems dying annually) versus a biomass (% total aboveground biomass dying annually) basis. Mortality rates ranged from 0. 5 to 3.3 percent (stems) and 0. 1 to 3.9 percent (biomass). Annual mortality rate of stems versus mortality rate of biomass differed by as much as 20 percent within a plot; greater mortality rate of biomass on a yearly basis was attributable to the death of large trees. Annual percent mortality was independent of life zone, diameter class within life zone, and crown class. The majority of trees died standing (64%) followed by fallen (17%), snapped (I 1%), and other unknown causes (I 1%). Estimates of the mean half-life of all plots were 36.9 and 42.5 yr based on stems and biomass, respectively, in the tropical moist forest, and 39.3 and 36.3 yr, respectively, in the tropical lower montane moist forest. Large diameter classes had the longest half-lives. Similarity in stem and biomass based half-lives within a life zone suggests that although there is great variability at the individual plot scale, stems and biomass yield similar estimates of mortality at the larger life zone scale.

AB Dalhousiea africana S. Moore (Papilionaceae) is a common twining liana in disturbed forests in northeast Gabon. Natural populations are remarkably clustered in comparison with other lianas in these forests and are mainly of clonal origin. Ramets are produced by longitudinal splitting of the stems.
   The anatomical organisation of D. africana stems (wedges assembled in quarters) predetermines the splitting or cleavage surfaces (at wide unlignified rays in the conducting tissues). Cloning by longitudinal splitting of individuals into strands is interpreted as a good adaptive response to extremely unstable forest conditions. The aerial architecture of the liana, with several small leaf crowns in the canopy, may enhance acceleration of the process.

AB Two types of nectaries occur in the neotropical genus Inga (Fabaceae: Mimosoideae). Floral nectar is ingested by visitors to flowers and foliar nectar is utilized by a variety of insects. Although their flowers are similar in appearance and morphology, different Inga species exhibit different floral behaviors and have different primary pollinators. The floral nectars of the eight species analyzed are, however, similar in proportions of various sugars. Freshly secreted floral nectars are sucrose-dominant, though over time the sucrose is hydrolyzed and nectars become hexose-rich. In some species, this change corresponds to a shift in the pollinator fauna. Amino acid constituents of floral nectars differ among Inga spp., but are constant within a species.
   Extrafloral nectars are hexose-dominant and have substantially greater sugar concentrations than floral nectars. Extrafloral nectars of different species differ in army of amino acids present, but amino acids in floral and extrafloral nectar of a given species are similar, but not identical. Differences in composition of the two types of nectar produced by a given Inga species may result from natural selection by mutualists utilizing the nectar as well as non-evolutionary influences of the abiotic and biotic environment.

AB The composition, density, and fruiting phenology of arborescent palms were examined in a remote term firme forest site near the upper Urucu river, Amazonas, Brazil. A total of 248 individuals with a diameter at breast height (DBH) greater-than-or-equal-to 10 cm, including 8 single-stemmed and 1 multistemmed species, occurred within a 5-ha area (twelve 0.25-ha plots and two 1-ha plots). Using a point-quadrant method, an additional 75 palms were tagged along 4.9 km of transects. Arborescent palms accounted for 7 percent of 4915 trees, and comprised the sixth most abundant tree family. The combined density of all palm species was substantially greater in relatively patchy areas of poorly drained to waterlogged soils within creekside forest (81 ind./ha) than on well-drained, high forest soils (36 ind./ha). Palm species appeared to segregate according to habitat topography, resulting in two relatively distinct subcommunities. Jessenia bataua, the most common species, accounted for 42 percent of the arborescent palms. Immature and mature fruits of this and other palm species were available throughout the year, and represented an important food source for frugivores during the dry season, when ripe fleshy fruits of nonpalm trees became rare or nonexistent. The reproductive phenology of arborescent palms is discussed in terms of its role in sustaining frugivores through periods of generalized ripe fruit scarcity.

AB The button cactus, Melocactus violaceus (Cactaceae), occurs in open, sandy soils in southern Brazilian coastal areas. The fruits of this species are pink, cone-shaped, and have a high water content and low sugar concentration. The fruits of M. violaceus develop while completely protected inside the cephalium and are driven out by internal pressure when ripe. Fruits can be exposed in only a few minutes during the hottest part of the day, and they become easily visible over the cephalium. They are expelled more quickly when temperature is high and lizards are more active. During the dry season these fruits appear to be eaten exclusively by the lizard Tropidurus torquatus (Tropiduridae). The cephalium is positioned dose to soil level and the bright color of the fruits apparently improves fruit detection. Lizards defecate viable M. violaceus seeds. These seeds germinated quickly under laboratory conditions, while seeds collected directly from ripe fruits did not germinate under the same conditions. Cactus and fruit morphology, and the diurnal pattern of fruit release, may represent a suite of adaptations for dispersal by Tropidurus torquatus.

AB Our study addresses the influence of Tabebuia ochracea leaf variation on insect herbivores. We studied the roles of leaf size, age, and hairyness in die feeding choices of chewing and sucking herbivores. The T. ochracea studied belonged to a single done, thus decreasing the potential influences of host plant genetic and chemical variation on herbivore choice.
   Young and mature leaves showed the same amount of damage from chewing herbivores in the field. Homopterans (Rbabdotalebra spp.) and hemipterans (Tixgis tecomae) occurred primarily on large leaves. The leaf area consumed by grasshoppers in a laboratory experiment was higher on young leaves than on mature leaves. Nevertheless, there was no difference in the choice by Rbabdotalebra spp. and T. tecomae for young vs mature leaves of T. ochracea. Mature, large leaves were chosen over mature, small leaves by Rbabdotalebra spp. and T. tecomae. In a laboratory experiment, T. tecomae did not choose between leaf circles of same size taken from large or small leaves, indicating that the most relevant factor in its food choice was leaf size. Nevertheless, Rbabdotalebra spp. significantly chose leaf circles taken from large leaves, indicating that leaf trichome density was an important component in its food choice. The differential distribution of small and large leaves was important in the food selection by T. tecomae; whereas, trichome density was a relevant factor in food selection by Rbabdotalebra spp.

AB Fourteen nests of the ponerine ant Paltothyreus tarsatus were excavated in Kenya and in the Ivory Coast. All colonies contained only one mated queen. The worker population varied markedly between colonies, reaching 2444 adults in one case. Nests consisted of many chambers located 30 cm to more than 150 cm below the surface. The construction and arrangement of the chambers were not particularly elaborate, but the associated horizontal tunnel system (5-15 cm below the surface) was most remarkable. In one nest, over 130 m of shallow subterranean tunnels were uncovered. An area of 1200 m2 was covered by the tunnel system of another nest. Through multiple tunnel exits the ants are able to reach almost any spot in their foraging area. In some nests we found a second horizontal tunnel system, 50-80 cm below the surface, which connected nest chambers several meters apart.

AB The effect of hurricane disturbance on canopy invertebrate communities was studied at the Luquillo Experimental Forest in Puerto Rico. Invertebrate community structure and herbivory were compared among tree species co-occurring in intact forest (standing trees) and canopy gaps. Foliage-bearing branches were collected using a long-handled insect net fitted with a doseable plastic bag. Invertebrates were tabulated and foliage was dried, weighed, and measured for area missing. Lepidoptera, predaceous beetles, and decomposers were significantly more abundant in standing trees; whereas, some sap-sucking arthropods were more abundant in canopy gaps, indicating that these taxa responded to changes in microclimate and/or host condition resulting from disturbance. Herbivory (estimated as leaf area missing) and numbers of several taxa differed significantly among tree species, likely reflecting host preferences based on foliage nutritional quality. Species diversity and the gradient of disturbance may have masked disturbance effects.

AB Natural disturbances can have large effects on ecosystem structure and function depending on their scale, intensity, and frequency. On 18 September 1989 Hufficane Hugo struck Puerto Rico, with the eye of the hurricane passing within 10 km of the Luquillo Experimental Forest. This provided a rare opportunity to evaluate the effects of an infrequent but large scale and high intensity disturbance on tropical bat species. Data on demographic parameters of three common phyllostomid bats (Artibeus jamaicensis, Stenoderma rufum, and Menophyllus redmani) were examined for three years prior and three years after the hurricane. Population levels as estimated by captures per net hour of all three species were affected by Hurricane Hugo. Populations of A. jamaicensis and M. redmani returned to predisturbance levels within two years. In contrast, population levels of S. rufum declined to about 30 percent of prehurricane levels and have not recovered after three years. Moreover, telemetry data indicate that foraging and home range size expanded to encompass an area approximately five times larger than its prehurricane size. The cost of foraging, in terms of time and energy, may be considerably elevated over prehurricane scenarios. In fact, a significant change in the age structure of the population (juvenile individuals have been absent from the population since Hurricane Hugo) as well as significant decline in rhe percent of reproductively active females indicate a failure to reproduce in the posthurricane environment.

ID TRENDS
AB Broad survey census data for mantled howler monkeys, Alouatta palliata, from La Selva biological Reserve, northeastern Costa Rica, are analyzed with an agglomerative hierarchical clustering method to estimate minimum number of troops. The estimate of 15 troops (7-15 howlers/km2) provided by the duster analysis is similar to an independent census of the same population using the triangulation technique.  These data indicate the potential usefulness of duster analysis methods to estimate minimum number of primate troops within an area. Cluster analysis has several advantages over more traditional primate census techniques: the assumption that it is necessary to achieve reliable estimates from line transect sampling is not required (i.e., points directly on the line will never be missed); census data can be collected by one person making it easier logistically than conducting a census with the triangulation technique which requires many people; census data collected over a brief period of dme can be used to provide quantitative estimates of population density; and observations provided by others in the survey area during the time period of the census may be used. Cluster analysis is recommended when attempting to estimate population densities of primates in tall evergreen forests where visibility is poor, when animals have long inactive periods, few or unpredictable vocalizations, and/or occupy the top of the canopy. The duster method of analyzing broad survey data may also be applicable to other territorial mammalian populations that are difficult to census by other means.

These epiphytes are adapted to growing on branches and are able to withstand periods of drought. Epiphytic density was greatest on the higher branches in comparison with the trunks. A greater proportion of trees > 1.5 m to < 1.5 m was recorded at sites with fire frequencies between 10 and 20 years. Epiphytic distributions appeared to be correlated with the sizes of host trees (> 1.5 m in height) and the effects of past fire regimes.

AB Changes in wood density, nutrient content, and invertebrate populations throughout the decay of Cyrilla racemiflora (Cyrillaceaea) were compared with those observed in temperate woody tree species. Wood density tended to remain constant as decay advanced except in the late stages. Nutrients (N, P, Ca, Mg) were in highest concentrations in intact bark, surface wood, and wood in advanced decay. Concentrations of N and P were highly correlated, as were concentrations of Ca and Mg. The C/N ratio was determined mainly by changes in N because C tended to remain constant as decay proceeded. The C/N ratio of wood in advanced decay was 79, one of the lowest reported, and the concentration of N was one of the highest reported (0.69%) in studies of wood decomposition. Nitrogen and P were in greater concentrations in the feces of the cerambycid Parandra cribata than in surrounding wood. A total of 138 invertebrate species was identified. The number of species increased as decay progressed. Termites (Parvitermes discolor and Glyptotermes pubescens) and ants (Pheidole moerens, Paratrechina spp. and Solenopsis spp.) were the most abundant invertebrates, with ants more abundant in snags than in logs. The scarcity of bark beetles and wood borers such as carpenter ants and bees in the wood of C racemiflora contrasted with reports of their presence in dead wood from other tree species.

AB A new classification and conceptual framework for plant phenology are proposed to resolve problems in describing tropical patterns. A long-term (12 yr) survey of flowering in 254 lowland tropical rain forest trees of 173 species from the La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica showed highly diverse, irregular, and complex patterns. Analysis of this survey data relied primarily on graphical analyses that provide data representation methods rather than numerical summaries that provide data reduction methods. The classification differs from previous ones in three ways. It uses, as the primary criterion, frequency of the time series, based on explicit time and amplitude scales, so that irregular temporal sequences are revealed. It features a system of subsidiary classes based on other quantitative descriptors: regularity, duration, amplitude, date, and synchrony. Finally, the conceptual framework separates patterns at each level of analysis so that adding the time series at one level produces a time series for the next higher level. Levels are hierarchical from the flower to the individual, population, and community with additional non-nested levels such as the guild. The four basic classes-continual, subannual, annual, and supra-annual-are applied to patterns at any level of analysis. The classification system provides a logical framework for quantitative description of phenological behavior leading to more standardized comparisons. Thus we can see that tropical phenology differs from temperate phenology in two major ways. In tropical species, the nature of the pattern may change from one level of analysis to the next, which is not typical of temperate species. In many tropical species, phenological patterns vary more widely over the geographic range of a species than they do in temperate species.

AB The assessment of fruit abundance is critical for studies of frugivore ecology. A variety of methods have been used to estimate habitat-wide fruit abundance. However, since the methods have not been calibrated with each other, it is difficult to compare results of different studies. Here we compare three methods used simultaneously to collect fruit abundance data in the Kibale Forest, Uganda. Estimates of fruit abundance derived from fruit traps were not correlated with estimates derived from either systematic transect sampling or estimates obtained from observing fruiting phenology of key species on a fruit trail. However, estimates based on fruit trail data and transect data were correlated. We review the advantages and disadvantages of methods that have been used to assess habitat-wide fruit abundance.

AB Anemophily may be frequent in neotropical dioecious trees, of diverse taxonomic affinity, as shown here for 19 species in 13 families at one locality, on the basis of floral morphology and pollen presentation. Flower-visiting bees often are not pollinators but commensal or parasitic. The perceived scarcity of anemophily in tropical trees is brought into question by a reconsideration of the evidence regarding pollen type, nectar, weather, insect visitors, and tree density.

AB Each species of fig tree (Ficus spp., Moraceae) is pollinated by its own unique species of fig wasp (Agaonidae). We examined pollination rates and functional sex-ratios among the fig trees that have colonized the recently formed volcanic island of Anak Krakatau. Four fruiting Ficus species were present. Two of these, F. fistulosa and F. hispida, occurred in small numbers and were receiving sufficient pollinators. In contrast, pollination rates were estimated at 8 1 percent for F. septica (80 trees fruiting) and only 18 percent for F. fulva (approximately 200 trees fruiting). Both these species had higher pollination rates on the older islands in the Krakatau group. Their functional sex ratios (the proportion of male/female trees bearing fruits) did not differ significantly from 50:50, and there were indications of preferential pollination of female figs. The shortage of pollinators (and therefore mature figs) on Anak Krakatau is likely to have consequences for the frugivorous birds and bats on the island.

AB We studied feeding guild characteristics of birds in northeastern Venezuela in three adjacent tropical habitats: thorn scrub, thorn woodland, and deciduous forest. We mist-netted and marked birds twice monthly to obtain data on site tenacity. We determined diet by examining regurgitated food samples. Species were assigned to feeding guilds by a cluster analysis based on the proportion of the different food types found in their stomachs. Characteristics of each feeding guild from each habitat were submitted to a principal components analysis. Five parameters clearly distinguished feeding guilds: number of species, proportion of transient individuals, amount of seasonal variation in abundance, mean body mass, and estimated biomass. These parameters also appeared to be related to diet characteristics (food types taken, diet diversity) at the species level. Differences among habitats in food availability led to strong between-site differences in the diet of several species, and, accordingly, in their temporal and spatial patterns of abundance.

AB The problem of pitviper bite in field researchers working in Middle America (Mexico to Panama) was studied using case histories of nine biologists and one project employee bitten during the period of 1980 to 1991. All snakes involved were Bothrops asper. Based on local tissue and systemic effects, seven cases were severe, three with permanent disability. There were no fatalities. Although antivenom was administered intramuscularly as field treatment to seven victims and later intravenously as hospital treatment to nine as patients, its effect on outcome was uncertain. Nevertheless, intramuscular antivenom is recommended following an adult Bothrops asper bite when there are signs of envenomation and travel time to a treatment facility is more than four hours. The Extractor (Aspivenin) suction device may be of some benefit, but incisions, constricting bands, and electroshock should not be used. Having a prior plan of action and implementing it effectively is most likely to improve outcome. Three bites occurred during 1.5 million person-hours in the field with Bothrops asper at four field operations in Belize, Costa Rica, and Guatemala. Although risk of Bothrops asper bite to field researchers is low, it should not be ignored.

AB Substrate and elevation fundamentally affect the primary successional fate of plant communities on Mauna Loa Volcano, Hawai'i. Native perennial grasslands dominated by Deschampsia nubigena form after initial forest development within well-defined elevational limits on pahoehoe lava flows. Woody vegetation continues to dominate at both higher and lower elevations. Woody vegetation is also dominant at all elevations of 'a'a flows. The exotic perennial grass, Anthoxanthum odoratum, has invaded sites where D. nubigena is a major component of the vegetation.

AB Values for percent endemism, the index of endemicity (Ie) and a ''geographical'' index (Ig) suggest that endemism of mosses is higher in Costa Rica, Ecuador, and Bolivia than in other Neotropical moss floras. Endemism in several Neotropical countries is lower than expected and this may be due to incomplete floristic records or strong floristic connections with adjacent countries. As a whole, the Neotropics have a unique moss flora characterized by 48 percent endemic species.

Leaf mass per unit area, leaf size, and the quantity of leaf pubescence all varied significantly and independently along these gradients. Most importantly, leaf mass per area increased, leaf size decreased, and the amount of pubescence increased with increasing elevation from 70 to 2350 m. Pubescence accounted for up to 35 percent of leaf mass in the high elevation sites.

AB An allozyme analysis of the mating systems of Shorea congestiflora and S. trapezifolia provide the first quantitative estimates of outcrossing in a rain forest plant of the Old World tropics. Prior to recent deforestation, both endemic species formed vast co-dominant stands with other dipterocarp trees in the southwest of Sri Lanka. Outcrossing rates were determined from seed cohorts collected from trees in the Sinharaja Biosphere Reserve. Eighty-seven percent of the seeds of S. congestiflora were the result of the maternal tree mating with other unrelated individuals. This high population outcrossing rate is typical of the limited number of rain forest trees studied in the neotropics. The range of outcrossing rates for individual trees of this species suggest that self-incompatibility systems may be variable among individuals. S. trapezifolia exhibited a mixed-mating strategy with only 54 and 62 percent of seeds resulting from outcrossing in two succeeding years. Differences between the outcrossing rates of the two species may reflect average differences in the degree of self-incompatibility. Apomixis could not be detected in either species from comparisons of progeny multilocus genotypes relative,to maternal genotypes.

AB Seed dispersal in the seasonally inundated flood plain forests of whitewater (varzea) and blackwater rivers (igapo) of Central Amazonia was investigated in a two year field study with particular attention being paid to the phenology of the constituent tree species and the role of water and fish in the dissemination of their diaspores. Maximum fruiting of the trees coincides with the period of inundation, and the specific timing of diaspore release appears related to special dispersal mechanisms, dormancy, and/or requirements for germination and seedling establishment. Due to the possession of specific tissues or other devices that provide buoyancy, the diaspores of most tree species of the inundated forests are capable of floating for prolonged periods. A comparison of diaspore characteristics between hydrochorous tree species and their congeners in noninundated habitats reveals recurrent patterns: some lineages that in noninundated habitats possess dehiscent fruits with anemochorous or zoochorous seeds, in inundatable habitats switch to the production of hydrochorous seeds. Other lineages that in noninundated habitats have dehiscent fruits, in inundatable habitats switch to the production of indehiscent hydrochorous fruits. Lineages that in noninundated habitats produce indehiscent fruits remain indehiscent when switching to hydrochory in inundatable habitats.
   In the inundated forests virtually all diaspores that fall into the water are consumed by fish, with rates of destruction differing greatly. Catfish cannot disrupt hard protective layers of seeds and fruits, while characins are destructive and act largely as seed predators. Very small diaspores, such as those of Cecropia, pass the gut of characin fish unimpaired and viable; for larger diaspores the rate of destruction seems to decrease with the age of the consuming fish. Most hydrochorous diaspores can be dispersed by fish, if they are not destroyed by them (facultative ichthyochory). Others depend on fish for dispersal (obligatory ichthyochory), for example, because their diaspores are very heavy and would sink to the ground under the parent tree, or because their seeds are enclosed in a hard shell from which they can be freed only by the jaws of characins.
   Ultimately, the diaspores dispersed by water or fish sink to the bottom of the inundated forests from where they start germinating shortly after the end of the submersion. It is most likely that the dormancy of many kinds of seeds is broken by their exposure to the hypoxic conditions that prevail in the still water. Evolutionarily, the synchronization of fruiting at high water must have preceded the origin of the adaptations for hydrochory, ichthyochory, and germination.

AB When a nectar reward is relatively low in quality and quantity, is it an effective pollinator attractant? In Puerto Rico, Comparettia falcata, a hummingbird-pollinated epiphytic orchid, produces an average one-time secretion of 3.3-4.0 mul of nectar (composed of 12.9-15.1% sugar) per flower. In contrast, nectar sugar concentrations of other hummingbird flowers on Caribbean islands are 17-37 percent, and those of Puerto Rico visited by the C. falcata pollinator have standing crops averaging 2.0-6.2 mul and daily secretion rates of 3.1-10.6 mul. In 1989 and 1990, we monitored pollinator abundance, effective flower visitation, pollinarium removals (male success), pollinations, and fruit production (female success) at two sites in the Toro Negro Forest Reserve. Reproductive success at the two sites did not differ in either year when adjusted for differences in pollinator activity. In 1991, we clipped the spur tips of all flowers at one site rendering them nectarless. Visitation frequencies and measures of male and female fitness were adjusted for site differences in pollinator activity, and all were significantly lower at the site where flowers were nectarless. In 1992, we abandoned one site and manipulated the other by clipping the floral spurs of a randomly chosen subset of plants so that 25 percent of the flowers in the population were nectarless. Pollinarium removals from intact flowers were significantly different from those with cut spurs and total visits were nearly significant as well. However, the difference in female success was clearly not significant between the two treatments. The number of visits per flower dropped dramatically from previous years despite the highest level of bird activity yet censused. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that the pollinator, Chlorostilbon maugaeus, perceives the nectar reward despite its small quantity and low sugar content, this to the advantage of Comparettia flacata.

AB Male euglossine bees, including Euglossa and Eulaema, collect fragrances from flowers and other sources and probably biochemically modify the fragrances and release them to attract females for mating. The fragrance-collecting activity follows a diel cycle that may be influenced by variation in the thermal environment. To ascertain the degree of the influence of the thermal environment on the activity of these tropical bees, we used Euglossa carcasses as temperature sensors to measure operative environmental temperatures (T(E)) of bees in forest openings (full sunlight) and in the forest understory (shade). We related activity levels of bees on fragrance baits in both locations to measured T(E), other environmental variables, and time of day. Shade T(E) had the strongest (although not significant) direct effect on Euglossa and Eulaema activity levels in the early morning. Operative temperature in the sun apparently had no direct effects on activity of both genera at any time of day. From mid-morning to late afternoon, only time of day (or an unmeasured variable correlated with it) had a significant effect on Euglossa activity levels; the relationship was positive near midday and negative in the early afternoon. Eulaema activity during midday could not be predicted from any measured variable. Eulaema activity in the late afternoon was negatively affected by time of day and shade T(E). From these and previous results we tentatively conclude that in tropical wet forests fragrance-collecting male euglossines may be limited by low air temperatures in the early morning; that neither Euglossa nor Eulaema usually thermoregulate by basking; that Eulaema activity may be depressed by overheating in the late afternoon; and that Euglossa activity drops in the late afternoon probably for reasons other than overheating.

AB Ants of tropical wet forests are common, yet practically unstudied, despite their importance in nutrient cycling and seed bank dynamics. I investigated the ecology of a leaf litter assemblage of twig-dwelling ants in lowland tropical wet forest and contrasted it with the better known ecologies of ground- and tree-dwelling ants. Nest densities at La Selva, Costa Rica were high (7.48 nests/m2) and potential nest sites were abundant. Colonies moved frequently (residence times for species ranged from 35 to 146 days) from one twig nest to another, occupying a wide range of twig types. Experiments with artificial nests showed that colonization was not reduced by the presence of resident ant colonies. Queenright nests (in which at least one queen is present) and queenless workers, as well as dealate queens, colonized artificial nests. Activity times and diet composition did not differ between the two species with largest sample sizes; workers were active under most conditions. Despite their abundance, twig-dwelling ants are apparently limited neither by availability of nest sites nor food. Many of the 32 species found coexisting at La Selva may be limited by high mortality during alate dispersal or colony movement.

AB The distribution of arboreal-foraging ants on cocoa trees was investigated t the Centre for Cocoa Research in Bahia, Brazil. The interactions between ant species were quantified using data on the presence or absence of ant species on 1100 cocoa trees. The distribution of ants was also mapped in four 30 x 40 m plots of cocoa, and the species richness and biomass of ants was assessed by chemical knockdowns from within the territories of five of the dominant ant species.
   Ninety-one species of ant were encountered, of which seven reached dominant status. A quantitative evaluation of the number of positive and negative associations between each ant species confirmed the status of most of these dominants and also indicated that a further 10 species may have sub-dominant status. The dominants were distributed in a mosaic-like fashion and, except in an old, non-pesticide-treated cocoa plot, gaps in the mosaic were few. Some of the dominant ants influenced the number of associated ant species, the length of those ant species with which they were able to co-exist, and also the species composition of ants within their territory.

A population in 2.2 ha of an abandoned tonka bean plantation was studied for 18 months. juvenile spiders lived between the leaves of low growing plants. Most older immatures and adult females constructed camouflaged silk retreats at a height of between 1. 5 and 3 m on tree trunks. Most inhabited trees accommodated single individuals. Dispersion was aggregated with a bias towards larger trees. The population density of long-term residents and vagrants was estimated to be between 13 and 30 ha-1. Diel activity was closely correlated with changes in light intensity at dusk and dawn. Ecdysis, reproduction, and associated weight changes were strongly seasonal, adult males appearing in the latter part of the dry season and young being born in June and July.

AB The responses of four primate species-saddleback tamarins (Saguinus fuscicollis avilapiresi), moustached tamarins (S. mystax pileatus), brown capuchins (Cebus apella), and gray woolly monkeys (Lagothrix lagotricha cana)-to seasonal changes in plant phenology were examined in a 900 ha plot of undisturbed terra firme forest in the upper Urucu river, western Brazilian Amazonia. These species represented the entire body size spectrum of habitat -generalists in a high diversity primate community. Changes in the diet of these species are related to a concurrent phenological study of a random sample of 996 large trees, and to monthly censuses of understory fruit patches, both of which show a clear annual bottleneck in fleshy fruit availability. Primate species fed largely on ripe fruit pulp for most of the year, but shifted to alternative plant resources during the dry season, when the density of fruiting trees and the abundance of ripe fruit reached their lowest levels. The main dry season plant resource used by the two tamarin species was nectar, while those of brown capuchins and wooly monkeys were immature seeds and young foliage, respectively. Exudates of Parkia seedpods were heavily used by all species. Nondietary seasonal adaptations to lean fruit supplies are described for these and other sympatric primate species mainly in terms of pronounced shifts in habitat use and ranging behavior.

AB We describe the abundance (dry weight) of angiosperms and other organic matter suspended within the inner crowns of a dominant host tree species, Ocotea tonduzii (Lauraceae) in a Neotropical lower montane forest. Epiphytic organic matter (EOM), defined as vegetation and dead organic matter, was randomly sampled from inner canopy branches of ten trees in Monteverde, Costa Rica. Total EOM (grams per square decimeter of branch surface area) showed a strong positive correlation with branch circumference and a strong negative correlation with branch angle. Approximately three times more dry mass occurred on large (86-140 centimeters circumference) branches than on small (15-50 centimeters) branches, and four times more dry mass occurred on less inclined (less-than-or-equal-to 30-degrees) than on more inclined (>60-degrees) branches. The variation of EOM was much greater within trees (between branches) than among different trees. EOM was composed of approximately 60 percent dead organic matter, 20 percent live and dead roots, 10 percent angiosperms, 5 percent ferns, and 5 percent cryptogams. Sixty-five angiosperm species in 18 families, with no strongly dominant species, were found among the 75 percent of plots that supported angiosperms. Araceae, Bromeliaceae, Ericaceae, Melastomataceae, and Orchidaceae contributed about 70 percent of the angiosperm biomass. Orchidaceae and Piperaceae were the most frequently represented families and those with the most species in the study plots. The most species-rich plots (greater-than-or-equal-to 6 species) occurred on brandies >50 centimeters in circumference, but the highest density of epiphytic angiosperm seedlings occurred on smaller, presumably younger branches.

AB Young plants of the palm, Astrocaryum jauari, are well-adapted anatomically and physiologically to hypoxic conditions. Annual inundation for as long as 300 days, at water temperatures of 28-degrees-C, produce neither leaf loss nor rotting of the roots. At a depth of 1.2 m beneath blackwaters, the leaves in the crowns of the plants show little decrease in the amount of chlorophyll. In contrast, submersion to an equal depth in whitewater produces a loss of chlorophyll. Photosynthetic oxygen production decreases to less than 30 percent of the terrestrial rate in plants submerged beneath blackwater, and to less than 10 percent in plants submerged in whitewater. Ethanol production compensates for temporary energy deficits. Respiration by the roots is greatly reduced but does not cease during inundation. Well-developed aerenchyma permits gas transport from the branches to the roots. A cylinder of stone cells and sclerenchyma fibers in the outer periphery of the primary bark prevents the collapse of the root aerenchyma due to reduced pressure within the roots and increasing external pressure as water depth rises.

AB We examined the hypothesis that tropical rain forest tree species differ significantly in the degree to which their regeneration is associated with treefall gaps. Using static and dynamic analyses, we evaluated crown light environments and forest structure around 0.5-5 m tall saplings (N = 424) of two pioneer and seven nonpioneer tree species in old growth tropical wet forest at the La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. Canopy photographs were taken with a fisheye lens directly above all individuals, Each photograph was analyzed to calculate a Global Site Factor (GSF), which is analogous to the percentage of photosynthetically active radiation reaching a site relative to a totally open site. The amount and directionality of crown illumination were also estimated visually using a crown position index (Dawkins & Field 1978, Clark & Clark 1992). Forest structure around each individual, a reflection of local disturbance history, was categorized as gap, building, or mature.
   Saplings of all nine species were found in relatively dark sites (xBAR Global Site Factors 1.9-10.8%). The two pioneer species (Cecropia) were found in higher light microsites than the other species and were significantly different from each other. There were no significant differences in GSF among nonpioneer species. Results were similar for the direct and diffuse components of GSF, and for the crown position index. In contrast, forest structure around saplings varied significantly among nonpioneer species but not between Cecropia species.
   For six of the nine species short-term height or diameter growth was correlated with GSF or its direct or diffuse components. GSF was weakly but significantly correlated with sapling height and crown position.
   Analyses over time showed that all nine species had progressively lower crown illumination and fewer individuals in gap/building sites for 2-8 yr after initial encounter. Particularly steep decreases for Hyeronima and Pithecellobium saplings indicate that these species establish under canopy openings that subsequently fill in.
   Canopy photography, crown position index, and the forest structure index all provided ecologically interpretable information. Only canopy photography distinguished between microsites of the two Cecropia species. Forest structure and crown position indices are rapid and inexpensive methods for obtaining long-term information on microhabitats around individual trees.
   We found significant interspecific differentiation in microhabitat occupancy along a light gradient of only 0-25 percent of full sun. A crude 3-point index of forest structure revealed even further resolution. This study focused on only three microsite variables and a restricted size range of saplings. Comprehensive understanding of tropical tree regeneration will require long-term concurrent measurements of individual performance and associated environmental variables for all size classes of a broad range of species.

AB Seed rain was measured in the center (open habitat) and at the edges of two recent landslides and in adjacent subtropical wet forest in eastern Puerto Rico. We trapped seeds for 2 yr after the trees in the forest were severely damaged by Hurricane Hugo. The number of seeds trapped per fortnight did not increase with time. Cumulative numbers of species were highest in the edge habitat during the first year but highest in the forest during the second year. Seeds from shrubs dominated the seed rain and also had the highest germination under shadehouse conditions (shrubs > vines > trees > herbs). The dominance of the seed rain by shrubs was apparently due to increased fruit production of existing understory shrubs in the forest after canopy removal by the hurricane, and to colonizing shrubs on the landslides. Peaks of seed rain coincided with short periods of high seed production by plants in the vicinity of individual traps. Despite large spatial variability, the seed rain did represent the local flora and long distance dispersal was not necessary to explain seed rain dynamics.

AB The diet of the Scaly-headed Parrot (Pionus maximiliani) was studied during three consecutive years in a 250 ha semideciduous forest in southeastern Brazil. The parrots showed a generalist and seasonal diet. Seeds composed 70.4 percent of the diet of parrots, followed by flowers (20.3%), corn from plantations that surround the forest (7.7%) and fruit pulp (1.6%). In the dry season flowers constituted 38 percent of the diet and leguminous fruits comprised 41.2 percent of its diet. Parrots are important predispersal seed predators and have a high impact on the fitness of plants in semideciduous forests, due to their high consumption of seeds and flowers.

AB This paper examines the influence of the availability and distribution of suitable display habitat on male display dispersion and social organization in the ochre-bellied flycatcher, Mionectes oleagineus (Aves, Tyrannidae). M. oleagineus is a lek breeding bird in which there is variable male display dispersion, with both lekking and solitary males present in the same population. Approximately 50 percent of males do not hold display territories, behaving instead as floaters. Discriminant function analysis performed on measures of vegetation structure showed that the vegetation of territories could be described and distinguished from that of nonterritory plots. These results suggest that males choose a particular habitat type for their display territories. The vegetation of 11 percent of 135 plots sampled along line transects fit the description of display territory habitat. Neither the availability, nor the distribution of such territory-like plots indicate an influence on male display dispersion. It seems unlikely, therefore, that the availability and dispersion of suitable habitat have been important in driving the evolution of lekking, or in structuring male social organization in this population.

AB The sprouting response of the vegetation in three areas that were slashed and burned under different fire severities was determined in a 12 year second growth tropical dry forest (''caatinga'') near Serra Talhada, PE, Brazil. Plots were slashed at the onset of the dry season (July) and burned on 19 September (B), 26 September (C) or 4 October (D). Sprouting responses were also examined in unburned areas. Longer drying periods resulted in increasing fire severity and increasing consumption of the original biomass (almost-equal-to 74 Mg/ha): 72, 87, and 93 percent biomass consumption, respectively. Prior to burning, plant density with a stem diameter greater-than-or-equal-to 1 cm at the soil surface was 5815 plants/ha. Greater than 94 percent coppiced after slashing, usually with epicormic sprouts, indicating their adaptation to periodical disturbance. Burning dramatically decreased the number of plants that coppiced. Two months following each burning 43, 21, and 10 percent of the plants had coppiced in the three burns, respectively. The majority of sprouts following fire arose from underground tissues. Coppicing crown area decreased from 1451 m2/ha in the slashed/unburn treatment to 350, 248, and 165 m2/ha in the three fires. The six species with highest plant densities, Croton sonderianus Muell. Arg. (2631/ha); Cordia leucocephala Moric. (1264/ha); Bauhinia cheilanta Stand. (819/ha); Mimosa sp. (474/ha); Caesalpinia pyramidalis Tul. (308/ha) and Astroneum urundeuva Engl (140/ha) displayed a variable response to increasing fire severity. Mimosa sp. coppicing was Little affected (49-43% survival) and its relative abundance increased with increasing fire severity, from 8 percent to dominance with 36 percent. C. sonderianus density decreased with increasing fire severity (946 to 174/ha) but it maintained a high relative abundance in all treatments (31-45%). B. cheilanta had the highest survival rate at low fire severity (78%) but it decreased sharply with increasing severity (down to 9%). Survival of the other species decreased from 30-50 percent to approximately 10 percent. Coppicing of Mimosa sp. was much more vigorous than that of any other species, with the highest number of sprouts per stump, crown area, and sprout height. The level of fire severity of the slash burning will influence future species composition of caatinga vegetation.

AB Experiments were performed to determine the effects of burial, light quality, and temperature on seed germination of Metrosideros polymorpha, the dominant tree of Hawaiian lava flows and rain forests. Fewer than 1 percent of seeds buried under 5 mm of sand were able to germinate and emerge, compared to 90 percent for seeds sown on the sand surface. Germination was greater under white, red, or far-red light (all greater-than-or-equal-to 62%) than in the dark (less-than-or-equal-to 10%). The light requirement was not overcome by a fluctuating thermoperiod (of 5-degrees/15-degrees-C or 15-degrees/25-degrees-C). Seeds germinated in all constant-temperature treatments (10-degrees to 34-degrees-C). Germination percent and rate (pace) were highest at 22-degrees-C and lowest at 34-degrees-C. There were intraspecific differences between seeds from pubescent and glabrous parents, with seeds from pubescent plants germinating in slightly higher numbers at high temperatures, and slightly faster in many treatments. The results suggest that M. polymorpha seeds are capable of germinating rapidly under a wide variety of environmental conditions, and are unlikely to form a persistent soil seed bank.

AB Melastoma affine D. Don. (Melastomataceae) is a pioneer species of rain forest and wet-sclerophyll habitats in the Australasian region. The breeding system and pollen vectors of Melastoma affine in the Mt. Spec region, North Queensland, were investigated over two seasons. Melastoma affine is self-compatible but does not produce fruit via autogamy or apomixis, i.e., pollen vectors are required for fruit set. The colonizing success of this species is thus dependent on the presence of a pollinator population. Eight bee species were commonly recorded at the nectar-less flowers of M. affine; although only Lestis bombylans, Nomia sp., Amegilla anomola, and Xylocopa near gressitti consistently contacted the stigma during foraging. When sunny weather prevails natural fruit set in M. affine reaches 90 percent, reflecting high visitation and subsequent pollination by such pollinators. The dimorphic stamens of M. affine both contain viable pollen which has to be extracted from an apical pore. Two modes of pollen extraction were common: buzz pollen collection, where pollen is vibrated from anthers; and, anther destruction, where pollen is removed from holes made by bees. Pollen collectors that buzz anthers spend less time at flowers than bees that extract pollen by other means. Furthermore, bees that gather pollen via destructive means rarely touch melastome stigmas.

AB Soils and porewater of the rhizosphere of mangrove trees, Rhizophora mangle L. and Avicennia schaueriana Stapf & Leech., of the salt marsh grass Spartina alterniflora Loisel, and of unvegetated mud flats, were analyzed for pH, salinity, platinum electrode redox potential, organic matter content, sulfide concentrations, and the total and exchangeable concentrations of trace metals (Fe, Zn, Cu, Pb and Cd). The study was conducted in a fringe mangrove forest in Sepetiba Bay, Rio de janeiro, Brazil. The rhizospheres differed in their biogeochemistry. Mud flats and Rhizophora soils were very reducing, with highest concentrations of sulfide. Avicennia soils showed the highest variability of the variables measured, with the rhizosphere changing from oxic to anoxic conditions. Spartina soils, on the other hand, were generally oxic, with very low sulfide concentration.
   The distribution of trace metals in these soils varied with the major physical and chemical characteristics. Mud flat soils presented the highest total trace metal concentrations followed by mangrove soils and Spartina soils. However, exchangeable trace metals were similar among the different soils with the exception of Avicennia soils, which due to their characteristic instability of redox conditions, presented much higher exchangeable trace metals concentrations.

AB Regional variation in the characteristics of gaps larger than 10 m2 was determined for three forest sites on different soils, along a climatic and vegetation gradient in the tropical moist forest of Tai National Park, Ivory Coast. The total inventoried area was 71 ha. The three sites were strikingly similar with regard to gap density, gap size distribution, and total gap area. Average gap density was 2.1 gaps ha-1, of which 0.7 gaps ha-1 were estimated to have been created during the last year. Average gap size was 41 m2 (55 m2 for newly formed gaps). Total gap area was on average 0.8 percent of the total inventoried area, versus 0.4 percent for the gaps formed during last year.
   Mode of gap formation differed considerably between the sites, and reflected site-dependent soil characteristics and floristic and structural composition of the vegetation. In Zagne, the northernmost, driest site, branch fall was the major mode of gap formation (47%), in Tai, the middle site, this was tree snapping (48%), and in Para, the southernmost, wettest site with hardened soil layers, tree uprooting was conspicuous (20%). An apparent paradox was found that at the site with the largest trees (Zagne) relatively many small canopy gaps were created. Branch fall is the preferential mode of senescence of emergent tree species; they slowly drop their branches when they die-off, creating many branch fall gaps.
   Though modes of gap formation differed between the sites, they resulted in similar gap size distributions. The differences in abiotic and biotic characteristics of the forest zones do not result in a clearly different gap regime. Canopy gaps in the Tai National Park are small, and forest turnover time is long (ca 240 years) compared to other tropical moist forests, resulting in a less dynamic, fine textured forest mosaic consisting of small eco-units.

AB Five of the largest remaining patches of livestock-inaccessible rock vegetation of Curacao, Netherlands Antilles, were described and compared to rock vegetation which has experienced centuries of livestock grazing. Study rocks (maximum diameters: 20-47 m) were located at two sites differing in rock type and altitude. At the St. Christoffelberg site, study rocks were siliceous and at altitudes of 240-310 m while at the Tafelberg site the rocks were of limestone and at altitudes of 35-150 m.
   The main vascular species on livestock-inaccessible rocks at both sites was Tillandsia flexuosa, a bromeliad. At the St. Christoffelberg, Tillandsia was principally accompanied by the grass Paspalum secans, the orchid Brassavola nodosa and the herb Portulaca venezuelensis, while at the Tafelberg it was principally accompanied by the vine Serjania curassavica.
   On livestock-accessible rocks Tillandsia ground cover was reduced to insignificant levels and mature plants were virtually eliminated from the population. Grazed vegetations also showed reduced vascular cover and were principally dominated by the annual grass Aristida adscencionis (St. Christoffelberg site only), the prickly pear Opuntia wentiana and the shrubby tree Acacia tortuosa, None of these weedy species, all of which are widely distributed on the island, were of any significance in ungrazed rock vegetations.
   It is hypothesized that Tillandsia-dominated ground cover may have been a common feature of the rock vegetation of the island prior to the introduction of livestock.

AB Hornstedtia scottiana (Zingiberacee) is a large, rhizomatous, rain forest herb with vegetative aerial shoots and short, lateral inflorescences. The floral characteristics, scarlet corolla, no odor, and copious nectar are typical of ornithophily, but the near ground position of the flowers seemed inappropriate for bird pollination. Also, the nectar of Hornstedtia scyphifera was reported to be largely sucrose, a sugar composition apparently atypical of plants pollinated by paleocropical passerines. The floral biology and pollination of Hornstedtia scottiana were studied in Queensland, Australia. Three species of honeyeaters (Melphagidae) were observed to be the only floral visitors capable of effecting pollination. Similar to Hornstedtia scyphifera, H. scottiana produced sucrose-rich nectar. Flowering was diurnal with anthesis beginning at dawn. Floral visits were most frequent during mid-mornings. By early afternoon, if flowers were not visitor-pollinated, elongation of the corolla tube effected self-pollination. Pollination manipulations determined that outcrossed flowers set significantly more fruit, with significantly heavier seeds, than self-pollinated flowers, suggesting an inbreeding depression. Mean seed mass data from open-pollinated controls suggested that the fruits produced were from a combination of self (65%) and outcrossed (35%) pollinations.

AB Field observations and experiments on the floral biology and pollinators of Phenakospermum guyannense (Sterlitziaceae) were conducted in the coastal savannahs near Cayenne, French Guiana. Phenakospermum is an arborescent herb that is distributed throughout tropical South America east of the Andes from Venezuela to Bolivia where it is usually found in open, secondary growth in savannahs and at forest margins. It reaches heights of over 10 m; each shoot is terminated by a massive inflorescence nearly 4 m long. Flowering occurs from the end of the rainy season to the middle of the dry season and a single inflorescence can produce flowers for 2 to 4 months. The large, hermaphroditic flowers emerge from the protective inflorescence bracts just before sunset and are receptive for one night. From 1.2 to 3.0 ml of hexose-dominant nectar, with a mean concentration of 16.9 percent, is produced by each flower. Flower-visiting bats of the genus Phyllostomus were the primary pollinators observed during the study in French Guiana. Caluromys philander, a nocturnally foraging marsupial, visited the flowers to rob nectar, but did not effect pollination. These observations on the floral biology of Phenakospermum suggest a pollination system that has coevolved with the bat visitors. Additional evidence on the pollination systems of the two other genera in the Strelitziaceae support the conjecture that specific characters, such as inflorescence habit, nocturnal flowering, and non-replenishable nectar, are specializations for pollination by bats.

AB This research quantified the number of ant-plant associations mediated by liquid/energy food sources and the intensity of their use by ants. Thirty ant species and 102 plant species were related in 312 associations. The Leguminosae (23 species) was the family of plants most visited by ants. Camponotus planatus was the ant using the most plant species (72) as food source. Ant-plant specificity was very low. Food resources most used by ants were nectar from reproductive structures, homopteran honeydew, floral nectar, and extrafloral nectar. Extrafloral nectaries are associated with leaves and most species in tropical dry forests flush new leaves after the onset of the annual rainy season. Both ant-extrafloral nectar and ant-homopteran associations show a significant increase after the start of the rainy season, decreasing abruptly once the dry season begins. In contrast, associations between ants and both floral nectar and other reproductive structures reach their peak during the dry season. There is a significant negative ant-floral nectar and ant-homopteran relationship at any given season; this may reflect the use of alternative (dry season/wet season) resources (floral nectar/honeydew) with similar nutritional value.

AB A population of Atta cephalotes was surveyed in 1989 and 1991 at the La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica. Nests were mapped along trails that passed through old growth forest. Estimates of basic demographic parameters were examined in relationship to general soil categories, suggesting that colony mortality and natality is related to soil type. Results indicated that the population is increasing at a rate of 22 percent per annum. Based on initial nest size data and on demographic parameters, a complete forest soil turnover time of 200 to 300 yr was estimated. The significance of these results for plant community dynamics are discussed.

AB Solitary bees are known to be important pollinators of seasonal dry forest plants in Costa Rica. Recent assessments of the genus Centris (family Anthophoridae) and other solitary bee taxa indicate that populations of these bees have declined by 85-90 percent in this forest over the past 20 yr. Deforestation, wildfires, and conversion of forest land to agriculture are the main reasons for the decline.
   From 1987 to 1991 we studied the preferred nesting habitats of seven Centris species that specialize in making their nests in preexisting holes in dead trees. Special wooden sampling units, with preexisting standardized holes, were systematically placed in several habitat types in the Lomas Barbudal Biological Reserve, Guanacaste Province. Female bees encountered the holes as they searched for natural holes for nesting. Systematic monitoring of the units over five years, 1987 to 1991, provided a quantitative measure of habitat preference and changes in bee frequency through time. There were sufficient data for statistical analysis of three of the seven species (Centris nitida, C. bicornuta and C. analis).
   The dosed oak forest was the predominantly preferred habitat for the three common Centris species, and this pattern remained constant through time. At least one species (C nitida) apparently had less strict habitat requirements as it was commonly found nesting in a wide variety of habitat types. Significant increases and decreases in frequencies for individual species through time were recorded; however, there was no significant change in overall bee numbers through time.
   Results of the analysis, together with a qualitative assessment of the rare Centris species, suggest that the dry forest is actually a mosaic of preferred nesting sites, with each species having specific preferences. This pattern is consistent with other Centris species that have been studied in Costa Rica. The preference for oak forests is significant and suggests that more of this type of habitat should be conserved for Centris refugia.

AB Vocalizations of wild Atiu Swiftlets (Aerodramus sawtelli Holyoak 1974) were recorded as they entered and exited their roost/nesting cave on Atiu Island in the Cook Islands. The echolocation calls of the Atiu Swiftlet resemble those of other Aerodramus spp. in their short durations (1-3 msec), peak frequencies (6-7 kHz) and broad bandwidths (3-10 kHz) but are emitted as distinct single pulses rather than the double or multiple clicks typical of most swiftlets. Spectral analyses indicate that the birds do not adjust the peak frequencies of their calls as they fly within the cave and we suggest the bird does not systematically structure the frequency content of its calls. Birds decrease their interpulse periods upon entering the cave and increase them upon exiting, presumably in response to differing light levels. As they land at their roost/nest site, birds emit a train of low interpulse period calls that is occasionally followed by a vocalization that we suggest serves as an announcement to other birds on or near the nests.

AB A general model is presented in which the dynamics of decomposition in terrestrial ecosystems are determined by a set of hierarchically organized factors which regulate microbial activity at decreasing scales of time and space in the following order: climate - clay mineralogy + nutrient status of soil - quality of decomposing resources - effect of macroorganisms (i.e., roots and invertebrates). At the lower scale of determination, biological systems of regulation based on mutualistic relationships between macro- and microorganisms ultimately determine the rates and pathways of decomposition. Four such systems are defined, i.e., the litter and surface roots system, the rhizosphere, the drilosphere and the termitosphere in which die regulating macroorganisms arc respectively litter arthropods and surface roots, live subterranean roots, endogeic earthworms, and termites.
   In the humid tropics, this general model is often altered because climatic and edaphic constraints are in many cases not important and because high temperature and moisture conditions greatly enhance the activity of mutualistic biological systems of regulation which exert a much stronger control on litter and soil organic matter dynamics. This general hypothesis is considered in the light of available information from tropical rain forests and humid savannas. Theoretical and practical implications regarding the biodiversity issue and management practices are further It is concluded that biodiversity is probably determined, at least partly, by soil biological processes as a consequence of enhanced mutualistic interactions, which enlarge the resource base available to plants. It is also concluded that any effort to restore or rehabilitate degraded soils in the humid tropics is promised to fail unless optimum levels of root and invertebrate activities are promoted and the resulting regulation effects operate in the four abovedescribed biological systems of regulation. Research required to substantiate and adequately test the present set of concepts and hypotheses are expressed.

AB Recent studies in Amazonia suggest that the ecological impacts of selective logging are minimal in floodplain areas where mechanized wood extraction is unfeasible. Yet demand for a wider range of tropical timber products is transforming forest exploitation in the Amazon floodplain. This paper examines early ecological changes associated with logging of virola (Virola surinamensis (Rol.) Warb.), an important export timber occurring in floodplain forests of the Amazon estuary. In a permanently inundated swamp forest characterized by an extraordinarily high volume of virola (243 m3 per ha), manual logging over a 5-yr period felled 90 percent of the virola stand and removed 145 m3 per ha. Such intensive logging provoked dramatic changes in the virola stand: after the first year of logging, the basal area per ha plummeted from 24.6 m2 to 2.3 m2, and over a 5-yr period, seedling density per m2 declined steadily from 2.3 (year 0) to zero (year 5). Although logging at this intensity is illegal, current forestry policies are ill-conceived and poorly enforced. Sustained use of virola, as well as other timber resources in Amazonia, requires limiting wood extraction to specified areas, where sensible foresay policies can be effectively enforced.

AB Vegetation changes in Sahel have been pardy explained by overgrazing. Some authors have queried the importance of herbivory as a cause of succession in arid areas, but this requires a differentiation between life-forms. In this study abundances of phanerophytes and chamaephytes were estimated on 30 hills on an arid mountain plateau in eastern Sahel, influenced by mist from the Red Sea. Their relative abundances were compared with a similar study in 1953 when the area was partly protected against browsing. Significant spatial and temporal trends were found by ordination techniques. Succession from an open woodland to a very open shrubland was revealed. Hardwood trees suitable for fuel and other plants of direct commercial value decreased. Plants with small, sclerophyllous leaves, and/or toxic chemicals increased. The changes are attributed to an increased human population and intensified browsing. These biotic factors interacted with drought periods. Species that also grow in the surrounding Sahelian transition zone were relatively more stable than those with a disjunct distribution in the region, which occur in die area of more moist regional climate found in the Ethiopian highland.

AB Two models are developed to illustrate how age or diameter may control the radial increases in wood specific gravity (SG), a feature common to lowland tropical trees. In the age-dependent model, trees of the same age produce new secondary xylem of the same SG regardless of their diameters, i.e., SG is dependent on age. In the radius-dependent model, trees of the same radius produce new secondary xylem of the same SG regardless of their ages. Then, prediaions of the two models are tested on radial wood samples from the trunkwood of Joanesia princeps Vell., growing in a 17-year-old plantation in Espirito Santo, Brazil. For this cohort, tests of four prediaions supported the age-dependent model over the radius-dependent model: final specific gravity was independent of radius (smaller trees did not have smaller final spedfic gravities), the slope of the mdial increase in SG with tree radius was negatively dependent on tree radius (smaller trees had steeper slopes), the coefficient of variation (CS) of SG of the final wood was the same or less than the CV of SG of the initial wood, and the CV of SG of the final wood was much less than the CV of the tree radius. Thus, for plantation trees of the same age, the SG of wood produced is primarily a funaion of age, not radius of the tree. Forest trees show similar relationships but with the effects of age and radius confounded because tree ages are unknown.

AB The role of figs as a resource for Malabar Giant Squirrels (Ratufa indica) during fruit shortages was investigated in two tropical forests in India. In general, figs were consumed to the greatest extent during lean fruiting periods, yet there was considerable intersquirrel variation in fig consumption during those periods. The importance of figs for a solitary, territorial, sedentary species such as the Giant Squirrel at these sites is limited only to those individuals who have access to figs within their territories or feeding ranges. The low density and spatial dumping of figs and the small number of fig species at the sites contributed to this phenomenon. The densities of figs were comparable to those found in other tropical areas. During fruit shortages figs may be an important resource only for a section of a frugivore population. Nutrient values of figs relative to other resources are also discussed.

AB Nectar samples from a wide range of flowers (120 samples, 112 species, 22 families) visited by hummingbirds (subfamilies Phaethominae and Trochilinae) were collected over a wide range of elevations and environments in Costa Rica. Some species visited are believed to be pollinated principally by perching birds, lepidopterans, and bees, however. We measured sugar composition (% fructose, glucose, and sucrose), daily secretion rates, and sugar concentration. In general, sugar compositions of all hummingbird nectars were found to be highly clustered toward the high-sucrose end of the composition spectrum and not significantly different from sugar compositions of other hummingbird nectar assemblages from northwestern Mexico and the southwestern United States. Significant correlations were detected between elevation and the percentage of fructose and of sucrose in the nectar, with the fructose percent positive and the sucrose negative. These correlations were found to be due to both elevation and hummingbird-group effects. Daily secretion mte and sugar concentration were both negatively correlated with elevation. Discriminant analysis indicated that nectar sugar concentration and daily secretion rates together could usually predict whether a species was pollinated by hermit (Phaethominae) or nonhermit (Trochilinae) hummingbirds and could often predict which eco-morphological group of nonhermits.

AB From July through November 1988 and 1989, apple snail (Pomacea doliodes) and freshwater crab (Dilocarcinus dentatus) populations were surveyed in rice plantations and seasonal wetlands (or ''esteros'') in the llanos of Venezuela to determine seasonal changes in density and size. Rice plantation sites had significantly higher densities and larger snails than did estero sites. Snail density did not differ significantly between months or years. In contrast, the density and size of freshwater crabs varied significantly by month but not between habitats or years: crabs were smaller and in greatest numbers at the beginning of the rainy season, and then declined in density but increased in size by November. The sex ratio of D. dentatus was skewed towards females, a ratio which was consistent across habitats and months. Fluctuations in snail and crab density and size are discussed in relation to the effects of wetland flooding regimes on the life history characteristics of these animals.

AB Between 1984 and 1987 we located and recensused 217 Paraponera clavata colonies on a 50 ha plot of lowland rain forest located on Barro Colorado Island, Republic of Panama. In this study we describe patterns of dispersion of colonies of P. clavata with respect to habitat type, topography, and intercolony distance. We then used colony mortality data to determine if differential mortality contributes to observed patterns of dispersion. Colony density was 4.34/ha. Colonies were overdispersed, but were not significantly associated with habitat type or slope. Colony mortality was not significantly related to habitat type, slope, or tree species or size class. Colonies less-than-or-equal-to 20 m from another colony had significantly higher mortality rates than colonies found at greater distances. Mean life expectancy of a colony was 2.5 yr. Intercolony aggression appears to be a major factor contributing to colony mortality in this species. Patterns of colony-tree association reported by Belk et al. (1989) cannot be fully explained by differential mortality, and thus appear to be due to selection by founding queens.

AB To analyze the influence of microenvironmental heterogeneity on soil miaoarthropods, populations of soil and litter springtails (Collembola) of a secondary regrowth forest plot and an adjoining cassava plot in southwestern Nigeria were investigated over an annual cycle. Dam on rainfall, moisture content, relative humidity, and soil temperature were simultaneously collected. Although there was a decrease in activity of springtails of the litter layer in the dry season, soil springtail densities were not significantly different in the wet and dry seasons in both the forest and cassava plots. With the exception of Tullbergia sp. that reached a single peak population in the cassava plot, fluctuations in numbers and activity of litter and soil springtails were similar in both the forest and cassava plots. Most springtail genera reached multiple peaks during the annual cycle, a phenomenon which is characteristic of iteroparous and potentially multivoltine species. The relative roles played by soil temperature and moisture content in influencing numbers of springtails extracted from the soil were found to be different in the forest and cassava plots. Relative humidity of the litter layer was found to play a minor role in influencing variation in the activity of epigeal springtails of the forest and cassava plots. It is concluded that population fluctuations are caused by life history phenomena, which are different for the litter springtails compared to the soil springtail genera.

AB Five species of Anolis lizards of the Luquillo forest, Puerto Rico were surveyed for infection with malarial parasites. Two species of parasite, Plasmodium floridense and P. azurophilum, commonly infect Anolis gundlachi. P. azurophilum also very rarely infects A. stratulus, A. krugi, A. evermanni, and A. cristatellus. For A. gundlachi, males are more often infected, and percent of animals infected increases with body size, but percent infected decreases for the very largest body size class in males. P. azumphilum is far more common than P. floridense, and the two parasite species appear to associate randomly into mixed infections with no evidence for interspecific competition between malaria species. Infected A. gundlachi have a greater prevalence of injured tails. The five anole species differ by body size (three large and two small species) and habitat used (shady cool places vs sunny warmer locations). A. gundlachi and A. evermanni are the only species that are similar in size that are often found in the same locations. Malarial infection may mediate competition between these two species of lizards.

AB Standing dead trees (snags) are critical foraging and nesting sites for animals, notably birds, yet little is known about snag dynamics or communities of cavity nesting birds in low latitude forests. In a comparison among 10 New World forests, we observed that snags in tropical and subtropical forests (N = 5 sites) occurred at lower densities (3.5-20.5 snags/ha versus 21.2-49.3 snags/ha) and had larger average diameters (27.6-34.2 cm versus 11.2-31.2 cm) than snags in temperate and boreal forests (N = 5 sites). No latitudinal trends were evident in average density of live stems or average snag height. An analysis of avifaunal lists from these sites indicated that low latitude forests supported 2.5 times as many cavity nesting species and approximately equal numbers of primary cavity excavating species as high latitude forests. If tropical forests have fewer snags, more cavity nesters, and relatively fewer cavity excavating species than temperate forests, limitations on nest-site availability could be more severe in lower than higher latitude forests. The availability of snags for birds should thus be considered by tropical forest managers, as it is by many temperate forest managers.

AB Population projection matrices were used to explore the population stability of Iriartea deltoidea in an extractive reserve in Acre, Brazil. Palm population structure at 5 sites was described using height class distributions; projections were based on survival probability estimates derived from the size class distributions, growth rates calculated from leaf production rates and leaf scar records, and fecundity estimates obtained from seedling densities. Matrix analyses suggested all 5 populations were stable under recent (1989) harvesting intensities; the dominant latent roots (lambda) of the five transition matrices ranged from 0.989 to 1.017. Elasticity analyses indicated that population stability was most sensitive to changes in survival probabilities of palms 10-15 m tall. Lambda values were relatively insensitive to changes in fecundity and growth.

AB The biomass and nutrient content of two steepland watersheds were estimated using allometric equations and nutrient concentrations derived from a subsample of the vegetation. Prior to the passage of Hurricane Hugo in September 1989, the watersheds had a total vegetative biomass of 301 tons/ha, 75 percent of which was aboveground. The total nutrient content of this vegetation was 907, 49, 644, 653, and 192 kg/ha for N, P, K, Ca, and Mg, respectively and varied with topographic setting. Concentrations per unit dry weight of P (0.16), K (2.49), Ca (2.13), and Mg (0.62) in aboveground vegetation were similar to other steepland tropical forests, while the concentration of N (2.9) was greater. Following the passage of Hurricane Hugo, the standing aboveground biomass was reduced to 113 t/ha and the aboveground nutrient content of the forest was reduced 45 to 48 percent.

AB Root grafting was commonly found in cabonuco (Dacryodes excelsa Vahl), a dominant tree species of tabonuco forest in the subtropical wet forest of Puerto Rico. Over 60 percent of all stems and basal area of tabonuco occurred in unions, dumps of trees interconnected by root grafts. Self and intraspecific grafting were extensive, while interspecific grafting was not common in tabonuco trees. Seedlings and saplings did not show any grafting, probably because of their size or age. Grafted trees were taller and had a smaller crown/DBH ratio. Hurricane damage was significantly higher in isolated individual tabonuco trees than those in unions. Weak relationships between diameter class, area, and size of union, and inter-tree distances and the sum of the trunk circumferences of the two nearest neighbors suggested that a noncompetitive force such as root grafting was more important than competitive forces in maintaining the unions of tabonuco, and thus the forest community. A conceptual model of the costs and gains of tabonuco in unions is presented.

   METROSIDEROS; OHIA; SUCCESSION; TROPICAL DRY FOREST; WATER STRESS
AB Metrosideros polymorpha Gaud. (MYRTACEAE), 'ohi'aBAR, dominates pioneer dry forest communities in Hawai'i, while other tree taxa dominate later seral stages. Tree density is greater in the later seral communities, and the dominant species there exhibit significantly lower mid-day plant water potentials than Metrosideros from nearby pioneer communities. This pattern suggests that the greater water stress experienced by the later seral trees may be due to competition for limited water, and this may restrict Metrosideros from these sites. The replacement of Metrosideros in later seral stages of Hawaiian dry forests contrasts with its maintenance as the dominant canopy component in both early and late seral rain forest communities.

AB This study deals with the proportions of seeds, ovules and flowers-fruits aborted, and seeds formed per ovule per inflorescence, related to the weight and number (seed, ovule, flower and fruit) of reproductive structures among five life forms. The study shows that ovule abortion, flower-fruit abortion and seed per ovule per infructescence were significantly higher in trees than in annual and perennial herbs. The correlations between the characteristics of reproductive structures and the abortion levels revealed an increase of ovules aborted with the weight of fruits and seeds, the number of seeds per fruit and flower, fruit weight/flower weight ratio and seed per fruit weight/flower weight ratio from annual herbs to trees. The percentage of seeds per ovule per infructescence decreased with the increase of fruit weight, fruit weight/flower weight ratio, percentage of ovules aborted and flower-fruit aborted. These results suggest that the increase in the energetic investment in fruits and seeds can result in an increase in the number of ovules and fruits aborted from herbs to trees.

AB The exotic arborescent monocot species from Madagascar, Ravenala madagascariensis, was studied in suburban gardens in Darwin, Australia. Inflorescences are long-lived branched spikes produced at right angles to a spectacular fan-like array of foliage. They are composed of a variable number of green boat-like bracts which contain a dilute liquid. Each bract subtends a series of individual, stiff, upright, large flowers which appear every 2.3 days, the total number of flowers being variable (up to 29). The slightly musty sweet smelling, creamy white hermaphrodite flowers, sometimes protogynous, opened at night (82.6% of flowers observed). Anthesis lasted, on average, 1.3 days and stigmas were receptive within the 24 hours of flower opening. Initially, nectar production was copious (1400 mul 12 hr-1) and concentration moderate (14.5% sucrose equivalents), but maximum production (1600 mul 12 hr-1) with slightly reduced concentration (12.5% sucrose) occurred at 2400 hr.
   Seed set occurs in Darwin plants, with the brown seed enveloped in a bright blue aril and displayed very obviously in the dehisced capsule. While autogamy treatments revealed that Ravenala is at least a facultative selfer, in Darwin the flowers were most frequently visited by the megachiropteran bat, Pteropus alecto gouldii, and only occasionally by the smaller bat, Macroglossur lagochilus, and honeyeater birds (Meliphagidae). Apart from reproducing vegetatively, the ability of Ravenala to set seed when grown outside its normal range in the absence of its co-evolved pollinator(s), either by selfing or by using a suitable indigenous pollinator, could allow the species to assume pest status in parts of the tropics where it is planted as an ornamental.

AB Fruit fall in the Luquillo Experimental Forest (LEF) varied with forest type but averaged 600 kg/ha/yr for the 11,000 ha forest. Within a given forest type, fruit fall varied spatially and seasonally. A palm (Prestoea montana) flood plain forest averaged 560 kg/ha/yr and individual palm fruit mass changed from season to season. Lower montane wet, or tabonuco (Dacryodes excelsa), forest had a low rate of fruit fall (332 kg/ha/yr) and strong seasonal pulses in both space and time. Fruit fall was higher in secondary forests (820 kg/ha/yr) and plantations (1418 kg/ha/yr) than in mature tabonuco forests that normally occur in those sites. Fruit fall in the upper montane, or colorado (Cyrilla racemiflora), forest averaged 263 kg/ha/yr. Somewhere in the LEF there always appears to be a stand at peak mte of fruit production. Fruit fall data are used to reduce a previous estimate of forest carrying capacity for the endangered Puerto Rican parrot, Amazona vittata, from 5 1,000 to 2000-38,000 birds.

AB Danaea wendlandii Reichenb. (Marattiaceae) is a eusporangiate fern which inhabits the herbaceous layer of neotropical rain forests. Morphology and growth of sporophytes from reproductively mature populations at the La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica were studied. The presence of four morphologically different leaf types allowed plants to be classified into six life history stages, which in turn corresponded to relative age classes determined by counting nodes. One year's observations indicate that leaves are produced at a rate of 1.6 per year in reproductively mature populations. Approximate ages of sporophytes can be estimated from leaf counts in subadult individuals, and from the leaf length and number of leaflets on the longest sterile leaf in adults. The maximum life span of a sporophyte in reproductively mature populations is estimated to be at least 23 yr. The first vegetative propagules (ramets) from leaf tip buds are produced at an estimated mean plant age of 10 yr. Sexual maturity occurs approximately 3 yr after the first ramet has been produced. Leaf tip ramets become independent within a year after bud expansion and are located at a maximum distance of approximately 21 cm from the parent plant. The reproductively mature population samples studied showed substantial recruitment in the younger age classes.

AB Insect herbivores that specialize on ant-plants must contend with a resident colony of predators that can use the insect as food or at least deter it from feeding on the plant. In Papua New Guinea, the euphorb Endospermum labios Schodde is commonly inhabited by Camponotus quadriceps F. Smith ants that are easily alarmed, recruit effectively, and bite intruders on the host plant. Plants that lack Camponotus often have other resident ant species. We compared the size, herbivore load, herbivory level, frequency of plants supporting vines, and degree of ant defense on E. labios with different ant inhabitants growing intermixed in disturbed forest. A glabrous morph of this tree had distinctly larger colonies of Camponotus, was dramatically larger on average, and suffered very little herbivore damage compared to pubescent morphs even though the morphs appeared to be equally preferred by foundress ants for colony initiation and as food by uraniid caterpillars. Herbivores on E. labios escaped ant defenses by exploiting plants that lacked Camponotus colonies. We hypothesize that colony initiation was less successful in the pubescent morphs in part because of a parasitic fly that attacks foundress ants.

AB The effect of disturbance on land snail density in a montane subtropical wet forest was evaluated during wet (March-April) and dry (June) seasons by collecting specimens from quadrats positioned along transects that bisected treefall gaps in the Luquillo Experimental Forest of Puerto Rico. Atmospheric and litter temperature, relative humidity, litter and soil moisture, slope, and substrate type also were measured in each quadrat to determine the effect of these environmental parameters on the spatial distribution of the land snails during two sampling periods in 1989. Of the 34 species of snail known from the forest, only five occurred with sufficient frequency to permit statistical analysis. The abundances of three species (Austrosolenites alticola, Megalomastoma croceum, and Subulina octana) were not significantly different in gap versus nongap areas. In contrast, Nenia tridens and Caracolus caracolla responded to patches created by treefalls. In particular, the abundance of N. tridens was significantly higher in gaps; whereas, that of C. caracolla was significantly higher in the surrounding undisturbed forest. Such differences in distribution may be attributable to factors related to diet and body water loss rates.

AB This is the first report of a non-Stenodermatine neotropical bat using ''tents.'' Tents in the palm Astrocaryum sciophilum used by Rhinophylla pumilio (Carolliininae) in French Guiana, are characterized by the typical ''V'' shape incision in the leaf blade. Additionally, the long inferior spines were cut in the roosting area. Using radiotelemetry R. pumilio and Artibeus gnomus (Stenodermatinae), another tent-user, were monitored to determine their response to the replacement of tents by intact leaves or by new artificial tents, and to the introduction of new spines to the roosting area. No actual tent-making was observed but spine-cutting was achieved by R. pumilio. Judging from nocturnal observations, tent-use is interpreted as a means of protection from adverse weather and predators during feeding periods.

AB In the course of a comprehensive survey of rain forest vegetation in the Northern Territory, Australia, population size classes of presumed adults of each species present were censused at 394 mostly small (<2.5 ha) rain forest patches. It is found that populations of adult plants are typically very small; most species were represented by less than 50 adults in 81 percent of patches. Adult population size is dependent on patch size. Of 137 common rain forest species occurring at 10 percent or more sample sites, only 20 percent of species typically occurred in populations of more than 50 adults per patch. After characterizing the adult population profiles of each common species as either very small (1-6 individuals per patch; Type I), small (7-50 individuals; Type II), or large (>50 individuals; Type III), these data are modelled via logistic regression with life form, sexual reproductive mode (dioecious or cosexual individuals), diaspore dispersal agent, dispersability (vagility), diaspore dormancy, and vegetative reproductive capacity. It is found that species with typically small populations (Types I and II) are characterized by the tree habit and bird/bat dispersed diaspores. By contrast, species which typically occur in large populations (Type III) comprise disproportionately large numbers of vines and ferns, wind- and gravity-dispersed species, and clonally reproducing species. The representativeness of the sample sites, and implications for conservation, are considered in discussion. It is suggested that these data provide evidence of significant gene flow between isolated patches.

AB Site and vegetation characteristics were examined in 113 Florida Keys locations that had been undisturbed for at least 50 years. Detrended correspondence analysis (DECORANA) indicated that Keys vegetation was arranged along two major environmental gradients: an elevational gradient within islands, and a geographic gradient associated with position along the NE-SW trending island chain. Both were complex gradients, with soil depth and type, periodicity of tidal inundation, ground water depth and salinity, climate, and geological substrate as potential contributing factors. Two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN) was used to divide the samples into 14 major groups on the basis of plant species composition. Finally, the TWINSPAN classification was modified to recognize 13 Ecological Site Units which were homogeneous in important site factors as well as vegetation characteristics. Plant species diversity increased from intertidal to upland site units, while canopy height, basal area, and fine litter production increased both upslope and downslope of the supratidal units.

AB Computer-assisted image processing of hemispherical photographs of the forest canopy was used to study the light environment of a mature lowland moist tropical forest in the Republic of Panama. Wet and dry-season measurements were made in 1983 and 1984 near ground level at 2.5 m intervals along two 1-km long transects; additional measurements were made at a single site at 5 heights from forest floor to above-canopy, and in 10 experimentally produced treefall gaps in which understory herb responses to gap formation were also monitored. Mean daily global radiation along the transects showed no distinct dichotomy corresponding to ''gap'' versus ''understory'' habitats. Light measurements showed the effect of seasonality in rainfall, and year-to-year correlation was low, indicating the need for frequent assessment of the light environment for long-term studies of plant responses. Various measures of total irradiance (e.g., canopy openness, minutes of potential sunflecks, total solar energy) were highly correlated. However, the correlation of canopy openness in the eastern and western octants of the hemispherical images was low, indicating that the time of day in which direct sunlight occurs may differentiate microsites with similar daily total light levels. In treefall gaps, the light environment was more heterogeneous one year after treefalls; but, two years after the treefall, light levels were both lower and more homogeneous. Both spatial and temporal complexity in the light environment suggest that ''gap'' versus ''understory'' characterizations are too simplistic.

AB Radial (pith-to-bark) wood samples from Ochroma pyramidale sampled at breast height and at subsequent five meter height intervals were analyzed to determine basic specific gravity. Specific gravity increased linearly with radial distance at any given height. In multiple regressions both radial distance and height proved to be equally important independent variables in explaining variation in specific gravity. However, when radial distance was measured centripetally (bark-to-pith) rather than centrifugally (pith-to-bark), the importance of height diminished drastically. These results suggest that the secondary xylem produced at any one time along the bole exhibits the same specific gravity. This time-constant model is contrasted with the alternative extreme, the radius-constant model, where xylem at a given radial distance (pith-to-bark) would exhibit the same specific gravity. Both models present alternative developmental patterns for tropical wet forest species which commonly exhibit increases in specific gravity with distance from the pith.

AB Fecundity and seed dispersal of Lophopetalum wightianum, Wight (Celastraceae), a wind dispersed canopy tree species, were studied in the rain forests of the Western Ghats, India. The effects of fruit crop size, seed characteristics, tree height, and wind speed on seedfall and dispersal distances were investigated. Fruiting was synchronous and fruits were produced between February and April. Smaller fruits suffered more predispersal predation. The majority of seeds, described as rolling autogyros were dispersed near the parent. The rate of descent of seeds was related to the square root of wing-loading. However, wind speed significantly decreased the rate of descent and increased dispersal distances. Taller trees dispersed seeds more evenly. Large trees had a significant dispersal advantage since they were more fecund and dispersed seeds further away and more evenly, thereby decreasing the probability of mortality due to density and distance dependent predation. These results show that there is convergence in dispersal strategies of Lophopetalum wightianum with wind dispersed trees studied in the neotropics.

AB Many types of biological studies require the estimation of food abundance in tropical forests, and a variety of methods have been used to estimate this parameter. Here we compare the accuracy and precision of three methods for estimating the fruit abundance (biomass and number) of tropical tree species: tree diameter, crown volume, and visual estimation. Diameter at breast height (DBH) was the most consistently accurate method and exhibited low levels of interobserver variability. Generally, crown volume was neither precise nor accurate. The visual estimation method was accurate for trees with very large fruit, but exhibited high interobserver variability.

AB Leaves are especially vulnerable to herbivores during the ephemeral period of leaf expansion, and thus, aspects of leaf phenology may influence herbivore damage. Plants that produce leaves when insect abundance is low may temporally escape herbivores, and plants that produce leaves in synchronous flushes may satiate herbivores.
   In response to a dry season rain, individuals of Hybanthus prunifolius (Violaceae) produce flowers and leaves in synchrony. The relationship between dry season leaf production and herbivory was determined by comparing leaf damage among leaf cohorts produced during natural flushes (dry season) and experimentally delayed flushes (wet season). Herbivore damage of natural leaf cohorts (6%) was significantly lower than leaf cohorts that were produced in the wet season (18%). Dry season leaf production by H. prunifolius avoids the peak period of herbivore abundance at the beginning of the wet season.

Seeds of Paspalum distichum were in the dung of these large herbivores during most of the year, while Acacia nilotica and Prosopus juliflora were found during the hot-dry season and Echinochloa crusgalli during the monsoon. Dinerstein (1989) found only a few seeds of a total of 13 species of small-seeded plants in the dung of herbivores in the nearby Royal Chitwan National Park (Nepal), while in our study, 37 small-seeded species germinated from the dung of nilgai, feral cattle, and wild boar. Also, three species germinated from the dung of Greylag Geese.

AB A single giant-leafed fig tree (Ficus lutea) is planted on the Rhodes University campus in Grahamstown, South Africa, some 500 km outside its normal distribution range. Small numbers of fig wasps (Hymenoptera, Agaonidae) which normally pollinate two other Ficus species entered and successfully pollinated the figs of this tree. One of the wasp species reproduced successfully. Monitoring of adult fig wasps arriving at the tree established that these alien species were not attracted to F. lutea. However, from laboratory studies it appears that once having landed on F. lutea figs, these wasps were stimulated to search for the ostiole, through which they gained entrance to the fig cavity. Females of a third pollinator species were also present on the tree, but they failed to initiate ostiole searching behavior when on the figs. Hybrid seeds resulting from the entry of the alien wasps germinated successfully, but did not progress past the cotyledon stage, indicating postgermination deficiencies in the hybrids.

The diet of 3 characids (Creagrutus beni, Hemibrycon dentatus and Astyanax metae), 1 loricariid (Chaetostoma sp.) and 1 poeciliid (Poecilia reticulata) was analyzed. The food eaten by the analyzed species was composed by allochthonous plant material, microalgae, aquatic and terrestrial insects (Coleoptera, Diptera, Ephemeroptera, Heteroptera, Megaloptera, Odonata, Plecoptera and Trichoptera). The aquatic insects of Diptera order were the most depredated by these fish, except for Chaetostoma sp., because it is algivore. Some temporal differences on the diet were found in some species. The low percentage of empty stomachs and the lack of variation in the relation size-weight between the seasons suggest that the food is not the main regulator of the analyzed populations.

AB Between August 1981 and December 1987, 5176 black sea turtles (Chelonia agassizii) were tagged at the East Pacific rookeries of Colola and Maruata, Michoacan, Mexico. These two beaches are the most important continental areas for nesting and breeding for this species. Turtles were marked with metal and/or plastic tags on the flippers. As of December 1988, 47 recoveries farther than 100 km of the nesting area were documented. Most of the recoveries (28, 60%) were from south of Mexico, mainly from El Salvador (18, 38%) and Guatemala (6, 13%). Two were reported from Nicaragua, one from Costa Rica and one turtle was recovered as far south as Colombia. Nineteen recoveries were documented from Mexican waters, principally from the Gulf of California and adjacent waters. The remainder were from south of the nesting area, mainly from the Coast of Oaxaca. Of the 32 cases in which the circumstances of recapture were documented, 27 (84%) were incidental catches of which 14 (44%) were by fishing boats. In five cases the turtle was caught intentionally, four with gillnets and one was speared by divers. The extensive post-nesting dispersion of the black turtle involving the territorial waters of seven nations along more than 5000 km of coastline calls for a comprehensive international program for the conservation and research of this turtle in the East Pacific.

Radiocarbon determinations on soil charcoal from La Selva and charcoal-rich lake sediment from Chirripo duster at 2430 yr B.P. and at 1110-1180 yr B.P.; dates in each cluster are coeval, suggesting that the rain forest and paramo fires occurred at similar times. Fires at la Selva were likely set by human activity but may have spread into intact rain forest during exceptionally dry periods; fires at Chirripo were set by people or lightning during what may have been lower lake stands. The drought periods suggested by our charcoal samples may have been associated with short-term atmospheric anomalies such as El Nino, or with longer-term shifts in climate.

AB Between 24 May and 4 June 1986, the island of jamaica experienced up to 635 mm of rainfall producing island-wide flooding. Planktonic communities along the south coast were studied before and after the flooding. Flood waters from Kingston Harbour flowed southwest along the Hellshire coast as far as Wreck Reef, but were confined within 4 km of the shore- Water in the bays along the lower Hellshire coast remained clear and unaffected by Harbour water, although planktonic communities there showed marked changes. The Port Royal Cays area and much of the shelf was unaffected. During the flood, the normal gradient of decline in planktonic indices (biomass, abundance, and community similarity) with distance from the Harbour was disrupted. The extent of flooding was evident from dramatic reductions in salinity and increases in extinction coefficient; temperatures were lowered by only 1 to 2-degrees-C. Flood effects were confined to the upper water column; whereas, surface salinity and phytoplankton were dramatically changed, they remained largely unaffected at 7 m depth. In surface waters, the number of phytoplankton cells increased up to 4 x 10(6) per liter (5 times greater than normal) while biomass increased to 30 mg Chl. a/m3 (10 times normal) and primary production reached 20.5 mg C/m3/hr (20 times normal). These large increases in both biomass and primary production occurred primarily in the nanoplankton size fraction (2-20 mum) which was dominated by Protoperidinum spp. Within a week however, the larger net plankton (>20 mum) assumed dominance. These high values were short-lived as phytoplankton communities returned to normal within two weeks of the flood. Zooplankton abundances at first decreased sharply in response to flooding (e.g., from approximately 20,000 to 200/m3), but reattained normal values within four weeks following the flood. In some areas (e.g., Harbour mouth, Great Salt Pond) there was a subsequent 10-fold increase in zooplankton abundance (up to 209,000/m3) comprising mainly larval stages. Thus, return to nonflood conditions was achieved at different rates for the various physical and biological parameters.

AB Based on sampling of a hurricane-damaged Caribbean mangrove forest, stand structure and composition are characterized for both pre- and posthurricane vegetation. Before the storm, stand structure was typical of mangrove forests throughout the region, but poorly developed compared to upland forests in the same life zone, as expressed in a composite index of tree height, basal area, stem density, and species diversity. The hurricane inflicted the most severe damage upon the largest trees and markedly reduced che complexity index of the stand, but it appears to have favored the establishment of abundant regeneration by all of the original mangrove species. Periodic destruction of Caribbean mangrove forests by cyclonic storms is proposed as one explanation for their characteristically tow structural complexity as well as the tack of typical "climax" components in the vegetation.

AB In most tropical trees, vegetative and reproductive development are distinctly periodic, but often poorly correlated with seasonal climatic change. Growth periodicity of individual trees is proposed here to reflect primarily an endogenous rhythm of vegetative growth resulting from periodic leaf replacement. This endogenous periodicity determines the species-specific timing of flowering and can be entrained secondarily to seasonal changes in water stress. These assumptions have been incorporated into a simple computer model which illustrates the effects of various degrees of seasonal drought on tree growth periodicity. A range of periodic growth patterns observed in individual trees and tree communities subject to increasing seasonal drought can be simulated by the model suggesting that causal interactions similar to those operating in the model are sufficient to determine growth periodicity in tropical trees and forests.

AB A three-dimensional mapping and harvest method for aboveground biomass is described to characterize spatial distribution patterns of vine or liana individuals. Distance, height, and compass measurements are utilized for delimitation of one-meter-sided imaginary cubes, where liana stem length and leaf area can be measured and harvested later for biomass determination. The methodology, exemplified with the mapping of two individuals, was suitable to detect how stem and leaves of both lianas used differently their volume of space, and by harvesting leaf biomass within each cube, it allowed to detect leaf area index patchiness in the individuals and within the forest. In Liabum caducifolium, leaf area was distributed in patches within the forest, while in Heteropterys palmeri leaf area was on top of the forest canopy. This proposed methodology, particularly if combined with other ecological and/or Physiological measurements, may allow better insights of individual two- and three-dimensional space distribution, modular demography, ecological requirements, and environmental constraints within the forest.

AB We studied fifteen species of vascular epiphytes in a 1200 m2 sample of seasonally inundated forest (tintal) near Cancun, Mexico. The community of epiphytes occupied 14 species of host tree. While certain species of host tree tended to accommodate more epiphytes than others, no host tree specificity was exhibited by any of the epiphyte species. There was some evidence of canopy partitioning by branch size among the more common epiphytes (8 species with > 10 individuals in the sample area). Four species of Tillandsia (Bromeliaceae) tended to occupy the smallest diameter supports (mostly < 1 cm in diameter), while four species of orchid were found only on supports > 2.5 cm. However, within these two groups, and particularly among the orchids, support diameter preferences were remarkably similar.

AB The fate of the large (mean 12.6 g) seeds of Gustavia superba, an understory tree, was analyzed on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama. Eight hundred thread-marked seeds were placed on the ground at two contrasting 1-ha forest sites (Gustavia-rich vs Gustavia-poor) during two periods (June and July) of the fruiting season of G. superba.  These months correspond to maximum food availability on BCI. On average, 85.5 percent of the seeds were removed within 28 days, 47.5 percent and 3.8 percent of them being found scatterhoarded (buried) by agouti (Dasyprocta punctata) and gnawed by rodents, respectively, within 10 m of their origins. The effect of site and the interaction of site with month significantly affected seed removal rates, but not scatterhoarding rates. Proportions of seeds removed were greater where G. superba trees were rare. Because freshly fallen seeds were not infested by bruchid weevils, unburied and germinating seeds provide an abundant short-term food supply for terrestrial mammals. Burying seeds allowed agoutis to later consume cotyledons of germinating seeds from mid-August throughout October, when food is scarce on BCI. Overall seed dispersal effectiveness (% seed dispersal multiplied by % seedling survival) contrasts dramatically between forest sites, being 10. 1 percent and 0.75 percent at Gustavia-rich and Gustavia-poor areas, respectively.  This result suggests that predator-disperser satiation occurred, maybe due to greater G. superba seed availability and other alternative food supply, allowing greater G. superba seedling survival at the Gustavia-rich area.

AB We examined the interaction of ambient freezing temperatures, dew formation on the body surface, and perch height on monarch butterflies' survival. We demonstrate that crawling up on the understory vegetation not only directly lowers freezing mortality by reducing exposure to freezing temperatures, but it also reduces the likelihood of dew formation followed by invasive freezing, that nullifies the monarch's supercooling ability. Monarchs that crawled 30-40 cm above the ground did not suffer freezing mortality, even when wet and exposed to -8.0-degrees-C.  Thus, monarchs that are stranded on the ground when it is too cold for them to fly can greatly reduce freezing mortality by crawling up the understory vegetation.

AB An analysis of termite fauna from two sites of primary forest in Brazilian Amazonia is presented, based on 0.25 ha plot sampling. Species lists are presented for these areas and for three other sites in Brazilian Amazonia. Sixty-four species of termites were found in a primary terra firme forest and 11 in a primary swamp ("varzea") forest in Western Brazilian Amazonia. Twenty-seven species were found in a terra firme forest in Eastern Brazilian Amazonia. The Nasutitermitinae, especially the genus Nasutitermes, were the dominant group both in number of species and abundance. Only six species in the terra firme and none in the swamp forest built epigeal nests. In terra firme forest, many species were found associated with termitaria built by other species. The majority of the species were wood-feeders, many of them restricted to rotten wood. The humus-feeders were the second group in number of species. The termite fauna of the terra firme and of the swamp forest were distinct, as shown by the low similarity index. The species composition and diversity were highly variable among different sites, apparently without correlation to climate or vegetation type.

AB Comparisons among three forest stands at the La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica were made of biomass, abundance, richness, relative abundance, evenness and species overlap of herpetofauna collected in leaf litter plots. The forest stands were primary forest and two different cacao plantations abandoned at five and twenty-five years in the past. Abundance and biomass of herpetofauna were greater in more recently disturbed sites, but evenness, richness, and diversity were greater in less recently disturbed sites. The more recently disturbed sites also had deeper leaf litter, which may influence prey availability, and higher percent canopy open, which may lead to extremes in temperature and moisture availability, compared to undisturbed primary forest. The results imply that herpetofaunal restoration is a relatively slow process, and that the presence of primary forest is important for the maintenance of some rare species.

A comparison of captures revealed significant differences in species diversity (H(s)) between disturbed and undisturbed sites (as reflected by deforestation). Species in the subfamily Phyllostominae (family Phyllostomidae) were captured significantly more often at forested than deforested sites and thus appeared to be useful indicators of habitat disruption.  The low intensity echolocation calls of phyllostomid bats make it unfeasible to monitor their distribution and abundance with bat detectors.

AB Between 11 September and 2 November 1990, 26 tent roosts, four of which were occupied by Macconnell's bat (Vampyressa macconnelli), were discovered in an area of mature flood plain forest in Manu National Park, Madre de Dios, Peru. All were constructed in the terminal blade of unseparated pinnae in fronds of Astrocaryum macrocalyx Burret (Palmae). Tents generally were not found in fronds of A. macrocalyx shorter than 2 m or longer than 4 m, or in other species of palms or broad-leaved plants that have been reported to harbor tent roosts of bats. The proximal four to nine unseparated pinnae of the terminal blade were severed to form the tent. Tents averaged 50.7 cm long, 17.1 cm maximum width, and 16.7 cm maximum depth, and were an average of 2.33 m above the ground. From one to seven bats were present in the four occupied tents but were not present in a tent every day. The density of active tents was ca 0.74/ha.

AB A comparison between forest structure and use of forest by Brachyteles at Fazenda Montes Claros and Fazenda Esmeralda in Minas Gerais, Brazil indicated differences in the proportion of large trees available at the two sites. However, despite these differences in forest structure, Brachyteles at both sites showed similar preferences for feeding in trees greater than 25 cm in DBH. The results of this study suggest that forest structure, as well as forest species composition, must be evaluated before initiating efforts to translocate threatened populations of this endangered primate.

This biomass and nutrient accumulation was in the same order of magnitude as the accumulation of biomass and nutrients in fine litter. Both biomass and nutrient accumulation were greater in communities on stream bank slopes or slopes of tree mounds. Less biomass and nutrient accumulated in depressions with long hydroperiods. Concentration of nutrients (except N), and annual rate of ash-free biomass accumulation (20-140 kg/ha.yr) were low in comparison with other bryophyte communities. Bryophyte communities in tropical flood plains appear to be biotic filters of flood waters and help retain nutrients in the terrestrial biota.

AB To investigate the dynamics of nutrient transfer in fine litter, we assessed the forest floor standing mass, input rates, and turnover rates of litter derived from terrestrially rooted material in a neotropical cloud forest in Monteverde, Costa Rica and compared them to litter dynamics in other tropical cloud forests.  The mean standing crop of fine litter was 10.1 t ha-1, and showed no striking seasonal differences but apparent annual differences. Input of fine litter was 7.0 t ha-1 y-1 and showed a strong seasonal pattern, with greatest amounts of fine litter falling during the dry season. Nutrient input from fine litter was (kg ha-1 y-1): N, 93; P, 6; Ca, 115; Mg, 15; and K, 12. Assuming a steady state condition in this old-growth forest, fine litter had an annual decay rate (K(a)) of 0.69 and a turnover time (1/K(a)) of 1.4 years.  About 25 percent of N and 42 percent of P were retranslocated from foliage prior to abscission. Litter nutrient fluxes were high and nutrient use efficiency was low compared to other tropical montane forests, indicating that N and P may not be as limiting in this forest as in other montane forests.

AB Nonvascular epiphytes within the canopy of tropical montane rain forest in Guadeloupe (French West Indies) are exposed to episodes of severe desiccation on more than 30 percent of all days each year.  This exposure to wetting/drying cycles induces the accumulation of more than 950 kg ha-1 of sugars and polyols by epiphytic bryophytes within the cloud forest canopy. These sugars are then released in pulse form during rewetting episodes and subsequently translocated by throughflow precipitation within the canopy. Sugars and polyols were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography and one- and two-dimensional proton and carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Total sugar and polyol reserves equivalent to 17 percent of the dry weight were seen for the upper canopy liverwort Frullania atrata (Sw.) Nees. In contrast, standing reserves of the lower canopy moss Phyllogonium fulgens (Hedw.) Brid. were less than 6 percent of the dry weight. Exposure to simulated wetting/drying cycles resulted in the substantial loss of sugars. Among sugars and polyols detected in throughflow solution were fructose and mannitol, as well as glucose, erythritol, glycerol and sucrose. Mean release of sugars and polyols during rewetting episodes was greatest for lower canopy bryophyte mats, at 0.9 g m-2, compared to 0.3 g m-2 in the upper canopy. These release patterns were verified under field conditions, where net annual release of sugars from bryophytes epiphytic within the upper canopy was estimated at 122 kg ha-1. These release episodes are postulated to have significant impact on nutrient cycling in the tropical montane rain forest environment, particularly for processes of microbial decomposition and asymbiotic nitrogen fixation, which are readily influenced by supply of exogenous sugars.

AB In tropical deciduous forest in Mexico, Jacaratia mexicana (Caricaceae) and Spondias purpurea (Anacardiaceae) are dioecious, deciduous canopy trees that flower and mature fruits while leafless. The concentration of total nonstructural carbohydrate (TNC) in the lower trunk is not notably reduced by reproduction in either species, and is depleted by growth only in Jacaratia. Branch TNC in Jacaratia does not differ by season, sex, age, or activity, except that fruiting branches show higher concentrations. In Spondias, at leaf senescence the branches reach TNC concentrations similar to the trunk, and branch TNC depletion is similar between the sexes but greater for reproduction than growth.

AB Long-term studies were conducted in French Guiana on the recruitment pattern of a large-seeded (47.6 g fresh weight) tree species: Eperua grandiflora (Caesalpiniaceae). Fruiting, seed dispersal by gravity, seed predation and seedling damages, and early seedling survival were analyzed from 1987 through 1988 (20-month period) at one tree standing on a slope. Most seeds land within 10-20 m of the parent, and a small fraction (5%) appeared to be secondarily dispersed by scatterhoarding rodents. As predicted by the Janzen-Connell model, dumped seeds and seedlings below the parent suffered post-dispersal predation and damages, respectively, by several families of insects, ants, and mammals. But because of large seed reserves, young seedlings were able to renew leaves or terminal meristems after defoliation or stem damage. Whether early seedling survival (7 months) was distance-dependent, mortality was nowhere near complete, and seedling survival during the next 12-month period (19-months post-germination) was independent of distance. Thus, juveniles persisted in a clumped population under parent tree. Dynamics of juveniles were studied from 1984 through 1989 and two 2500 m2 plots; an understory-environment (mature parent) and a gap-environment (dead parent). The proportion of juveniles greater than 100 cm tall was higher in the gap plot than in the understory plot. Although juveniles were very tolerant of understory conditions, they grew more rapidly in the gap. Occurence of young trees in the closed vicinity of parent trees is likely to result from poor dispersal of seeds, high survival beneath parents and high understory-tolerance of juveniles.

ID AMAZONIAN RAIN-FOREST; GROWTH; RETENTION
AB The growth of fine roots (less-than-or-equal-to 2 mm diameter) in a tropical dry forest on recent dune sand has been monitored for 2 years during the dry season-wet season transition, using root-ingrowth bags buried for short time intervals. In both years, most root growth was concentrated in one brief period after the beginning of rains, and it is estimated that the fine root system of the forest can be fully re-deployed before the start of water percolation through the soil. In an accompanying field experiment, root-ingrowth bags were protected from rainfall and treated with distilled water or simulated throughfall solution. Root ingrowth did not occur in the absence of rainfall, indicating that endogenous cues were not involved in the initiation of root growth. Comparable proliferation was found in the presence of distilled water or nutrient solution, indicating that moisture rather than high nutrient concentrations in soil solution is the proximal cue to root proliferation at the start of the wet season. The root systems of the trees comprising this forest can respond rapidly and opportunistically to increased soil moisture, which probably represents an important component of their ability to survive at this hydrologically extreme site.

AB The results described are of the effects of fire exclusion since 1957 on a small area of savanna dose to the forest-zone boundary, on the northern Accra Plains, Ghana. A forest thicket has developed, with forest species in intimate association with nonforest species.  The forest component includes healthy regeneration of the important timber species, Milicia (= Chlorophora) excelsa (Benth. & Hook.) Berg (nomenclature follows Hutchinson & Dalziel [1954-72] except where authorities are given) (max. 114 cm gbh) and Antiaris toxicaria Lesch. (5 3 cm gbh). Ceiba pentandra is the largest and most abundant canopy tree, with a maximum girth of 2 m (height 22 m). Other large trees were Albizia ferruginea (137 cm gbh) and the remnant savanna trees Lonchocarpus sericeus (74 cm gbh) and the naturalized exotic Azadirachta indica (99 cm gbh).

AB This paper proposes a rapid and non-destructive technique to age Rhizophora seedlings in the field, using the sequence of leaf nodes along main stems. Based on three- to four-year-old R. mangle seedlings planted in a bay on the Caribbean coast of Panama, it was found that rates of annual node production (=half of leaf production) in the terminal shoot was relatively constant between individuals in the same and similar sites, and for each individual when remeasured three or four times over 19 months. Marked differences, however, were scored between sites under obviously different light conditions, notably in shade (closed canopy) or sun (open canopy); estimates range from 3.8 (SE +/- 0.3) to 7.0 (SE +/- 0.6) nodes-shoot-1.year-1, respectively (note, these were comparable with branch shoots on mature trees nearby).  Therefore, neighbouring seedlings in sites with the same light condition could be aged by dividing total counts of main stem nodes by the respective rate. But, of greater interest, seedlings in open sites were found to have annual peaks of internodal extension along their main stems. It followed that seedlings like these could be aged by counting the number of peaks. This provided a more robust means to age seedlings having unknown growth histories, since it did not assume constant annual node production.  These characteristics of seedling growth offer a relatively simple means to age individuals, and to quickly characterize demographic patterns in seedling communities. The technique is limited by bark development obscuring nodes on lower stems, occurring after approximately six or more years in R. mangle. Furthermore, because node production was not apparently influenced by age, the technique may also apply to distal branches of larger trees in appropriate light conditions.

TI PHENOLOGY OF FLOWERING AND FRUITING OF AN EAST-AFRICAN RIVERINE FOREST
   ECOSYSTEM
SO BIOTROPICA
LA English
DT Article
AB Flowering and fruiting phenologies of important primate food species in three East African riverine forests of the Tana flood plain (1-degrees-55'S, 40-degrees-5'E) are highly variable over time, resulting in community-wide periods of relative resource abundance and scarcity. The phenological state of 240 individuals in 16 species within 3 forests was assessed at approximately 30 day intervals over a period of 17 months. The presence of flowers and fruits was visually assessed using a 0-5 scale that ranked the percent of an estimated maximum flower or fruit production. Unlike other tropical forests, flowering appears to be triggered primarily by dry conditions created by low river levels rather than low rainfall. Fruiting phenologies may be dictated more by rates of fruit maturation and plant life history strategies than by environmental cues. Altered river flow due to recent construction of upstream dams may affect flowering phenologies and potentially reduce fruit and seed production. Shifts in flowering and fruiting phenologies could, in tum, influence some pollinators and seed dispersers that presumably have evolved with the plant species of the Tana riverine forests.

   GUILD; HOST PLANTS; SEED PREDATION
AB An abrupt change of bruchid taxa, distribution, and host range is evident in central and southwestern Ecuador. There are several hypotheses supported by data. One is expanded host range of the genus Sennius, which is very specific to Cassia (s.l.) north of Colombia, but feeds in seeds of other genera and subfamilies of Leguminosae in South America. Stator testudinarius was found also to feed in Pithecellobium saman, Acanthoscelides isla has a disjunct distribution due to past geologic changes. It feeds in seeds of Rhynchosia spp. only in Panama, Costa Rica, and Ecuador. Endemism in a biogeographically isolated area is exemplified by Acanthoscelides siemensi which feeds only in seeds of Duranta dombeyana in one locality in Ecuador. Guilds of bruchids are discussed because Stator testudinarius and Pseudopa-chymerina spinipes replace other bruchids in the same seed guilds there. Based on our data, we hypothesize that the distribution of bruchids in Ecuador is due to geologic events and present floral composition.

AB We used fecal samples collected from birds captured in mist nets to determine the occurrence of fruit in the diets of neotropical migrant birds (species that breed in Nor-th America and winter in Central and South America) at six study sites in Costa Rica. A total of 10 16 migrants representing 30 species were captured. Fecal samples were collected from 85 percent of all birds captured, Fruits (seeds, pulp) occurred in 58 percent of all fecal samples; the proportion of fecal samples containing fruit ranged from 0 percent (9 species) to over 90 percent (9 species). Individual fecal samples contained seeds from as many as 4 species of plants. At least 98 plant species from at least 29 plant families were represented in fecal samples. Species of Melastomataceae accounted for 37 percent and those of Rubiaceae for 16 percent of all species recorded. Number of fruit species in diets of individual migrant species ranged from 0 (9 species) to 63 (Swainson's Thrush, Catharus ustulatus). Our data demonstrate that some migrants may rival permanent residents in the diversity of fruits they consume. A shift to increased frugivory in the late dry season, as birds were preparing to migrate north, was noted.

The author traces changes in the conceptual framework of community ecology during this period, using examples from his own work with hummingbird flower mites and from the tropical research of others who have been associated with OTS. The principal lesson to be learned from this period is that the same pattern may result from several different processes; there are distinct, valid explanations for different cases of what tropical ecologists used to see as a unitary phenomena.

Tropical biologists can make and have made significant contributions to understanding these effects, but we can also learn a great deal from the atmospheric sciences. In this paper, we show how knowledge about the functioning of tropical ecosystems can contribute to building a global source budget for a greenhouse gas (nitrous oxide), and how accumulating information from atmospheric measurements suggests that increased concentrations of a reactive gas (tropospheric ozone) represent a significant perturbation to tropical ecosystems-even in remote areas.

AB In order to characterize the organic and isotopic compositions and the origin of the sediment deposited in the Amazon river floodplain, samples from lake bottom, grass cover, and vegetation free sediments were studied. The results obtained showed that after deposition the organic characteristics of these sediments were altered according to their environment. Thus, compared to river-transported fine particulate organic matter (FPOM), samples from the lake bottom sediments showed increases in carbon and nitrogen concentrations, and decreases in delta-C-13 values due to the low isotopic composition of the particulate organic carbon in the lakes. Samples from areas covered by grasses had lower nitrogen and carbon relative to FPOM. The isotopic composition was changed by organic matter produced by the grasses, becoming less negative in delta-C-13 in the downriver direction. In the vegetation-free samples, collected over areas that had been recently drained, the isotopic composition did not change in relation to FPOM, but a decrease in carbon and nitrogen was observed.

AB The debate about microevolutionary processes resulting in speciation in tropical woody plants has been largely based on different and contrasting perceptions about their modes of reproduction. The research during the last twenty years has shown that most tropical woody plants are strongly outcrossed. Recent quantitative estimates of mating systems and analyses of population genetic structures, respectively, indicate that the rates of outcrossing are high and there is considerable genetic diversity within populations. Although data on mating systems and population genetic structure have not settled the issue of speciation modes in tropical woody plants, empirical studies have provided little support for the notions about prevalence of selfing and a high level of inbreeding. Further progress in understanding speciation should come from the study of genera with a large number of sympatric species. Two profitable areas of research might involve the evaluation of the part played by plant-pollinator interactions in speciation and the documentation of the levels of gene flow and genetic differentiation among populations.

AB Many tropical species flush entire canopies of red, white, or light green young leaves. In these species, there is a delay of the normal greening process until after leaves have fully expanded and have begun to toughen. Delayed greening involves a delay in the input of chlorophyll, rubisco, nitrogen, and energy. Photosynthetic capacity is therefore lower than in species with normal greening. At full expansion, leaves begin to toughen quickly, and rates of herbivory drop by a factor of 4. We suggest that delayed greening has evolved as a mechanism for minimizing losses to herbivores by delaying input of valuable resources until after the leaf is fully expanded and better protected by toughness. These benefits outweigh the costs of forfeited photosynthesis in the shaded understory but not in the high light treefall gaps. This cost evaluation suggests that, in the face of herbivory, it is advantageous to have delayed greening in the shade and normal development in the sun. Data from 175 of the most common tree species on Barro Colorado Island confirm that delayed greening is extremely common in shade tolerant species and rare in gap specialists.

AB Herbivory in the canopies of Australian rain forest trees was measured from 1979-1988, and their associated leaf growth dynamics quantified. Levels of defoliation were compared on several spatial scales: within and among canopies of one species (Doryphora sassafras Endl.) (Monimiaceae), between species, and among sites, light, and height. Sassafras was distributed throughout all rain forest formations in New South Wales, from the upper elevation cool temperate sites to the warm temperate and lowland subtropical sites. In addition, two methods of measuring herbivory were compared. One method (long-term observations) measured losses up to four times greater than estimates obtained by the second and more conventional technique of harvesting leaves to measure missing surface areas (discrete sampling). Leaf area losses in Australian rain forests averaged between 14.6 percent and 27 percent, ranging from 3.3 percent to 41 percent with species and site. The factors contributing to this variability within Australian forests and compared to studies elsewhere are discussed.

AB The argument is developed that the resource base, on which food webs are built, controls many aspects of trophic structuring. With emphasis on food webs based on plants, important effects are represented: the plant's influence on three-trophic-level interactions; the cascading effects of plant quality on herbivore attack and performance; the resource-based influence on the probability of competition in communities; how within-species variation in resources selects for high specificity in resource utilization by foraging females and the consequences for intraspecific competition at low herbivore densities; and, how minor differences between plant species cause differences in herbivore behavior and consequently the number of parasitoids in the food web. Phylogenetic constraints on herbivores are superimposed on plant variation. Insect species in which females actively forage for rare high-quality resources are constrained to be latent species, while those in which larval feeding sites are reached more passively tend to generalize on plant quality and can become epidemic periodically-eruptive species. Thus the resource base and the responses of organisms to this base have major organizing influences on populations and communities.

AB Well developed, complex rain forests of humid tropical lowlands (RFHTL) do not seem to support large populations of animals compared with other types of forest. Recent studies of terrestrial and understory species of tropical and subtropical forests indicate that the resources available to animals of RFHTL are generally scattered and uncommon. Human populations that utilize this environment contend with a similar pattern of resource availability. On the forest floor only ants and termites, among insects, are consistently common; they are utilized as food by a variety of specialized ground insectivores. Terrestrial herbivores that eat large fallen fruit are also generally scarce as are the often specialized insectivores that seek typically uncommon understory foliage insects, The low densities and high degrees of specialization that accommodate animal species to resources of RFHTL may be ultimately due to a combination of relatively low net primary productivity of undisturbed mature rain forest and the rapid rate of microbial decomposition of forest litter. To develop strategies of conservation suited to RFHTL it will be necessary to understand both the responses of animals to catastrophic disturbances and the often idiosyncratic ways in which animals and people utilize scattered and scarce resources.

AB Tropical rain forests exhibit high levels of species richness, complex food webs, strong interactions between organisms, and relatively high frequencies of mutualistic interactions. All these characteristics are thought to generate instability in food webs. We hypothesize that natural communities are stabilized by two classes of coevolved food web interactions (animal host-parasite and herbivore-plant defense). When model food webs including these interactions are compared to equivalent webs lacking these features, they have higher proportions of feasible webs, higher frequencies of stability; and, larger proportions of stable webs with realistic predator-prey ratios and realistic return times to equilibria. Parasites and plant defenses are able to stabilize food webs involving omnivores. Food webs with mutualists can be stable if the mutualist has parasites. Parasite host specificity and herbivore specialization enhance community stability. Results of simulations are assessed in relation to the poverty of data on parasitism in tropical environments, and management of narural or regenerated conservation areas in the tropics.

AB Programs for desertification control have to be formulated in response to the specific causes of environmental degradation. A method is presented to identify the main cause(s) of desertification in countries depending highly on agriculture. Applied to the Sahelian countries, overexploitation of the natural resources through overpopulation is identified. This is illustrated by developments in animal husbandry. As a consequence intensification of agriculture is a must. It is difficult to make the available technical options profitable in view of the socioeconomic conditions. Chances are negligible where natural resources are already degraded.

   SUSTAINABLE USE; TROPICAL; WEST AFRICA
AB This article examines reasons for the continuing degradation of forests and land in the moist forest zone of West Africa, where land is predominantly used for crop agriculture and forest production. Crop production is primarily limited by problems of soil management. The predominant soils, kaolinitic days, being dominated by low activity, retain little nutrients or water. Their fertility depends largely on their organic matter content, but this latter breaks down rapidly under cultivation. Continuous cultivation combined with shortened fallow periods, forced by increased demand from burgeoning human populations, leads to rapid degradation of soils, while so-called modem alternative practices are ecologically unsustainable. Forest production is constrained mainly by the high diversity of trees and the complexity of forest processes, which must be understood for successful management. Lack of such understanding, and the consequent inability to manage the natural forest to meet rising wood demands, has shifted emphasis to plantation production. This together with pressure from other land uses accounts for increasing natural forest degradation. Agroforestry practices, revival of narural forest management based on better understanding of forest regeneration dynamics, and fuller utilization of forest sites by managing plantations also for their undergrowth species, all within the framework of integrated land use policies, are underlined as promising approaches to sustainable use of land in the region.

AB A fragmentary fossil fish skull from the Miocene La Venta fauna, Villavieja Formation, in the upper Magdalena River Valley of Huila Department, Colombia, is determined to be similar and closely related to Arapaima gigas (Arapaimidae), a living species distributed east of the Andes in the large lowland rivers of the Amazon basin and the Guianas.  This fossil offers an additional example of a long and conservative history for South American riverine fishes.  This discovery corroborates biogeographic and geological evidence for a direct connection of the Magdalena region with the middle Tertiary Amazon watershed and its fauna.  The fossil Arapaima and several other fishes from the same area suggest former aquatic communities in the Magdalena region that were once more diverse than the modern fauna.  The Magdalena fish fauna was isolated as its watershed formed with Late Miocene uplift of the eastern Cordillera, and this fauna suffered local extinctions presumably as a result of tectonic activity and later Cenozoic climatic change.  Older fossils belonging to the Arapaimidae indicate that the Arapaima lineage originated before the Cretaceous Afro-South American drift/vicariance event.

AB The very low diversity of animal pollinators on remote oceanic islands can act as a potent biotic filter to potential plant immigrants.  To assess the relative difficulties faced by colonizing plant species, we studied the pollination ecology of kapok, Ceiba pentandra (Bombacaceae), a widespread aboriginal introduction to Pacific islands.  The Samoan form of this tree is self-fertile, but requires pollination for fruit set.  In continental areas C. pentandra attracts a diverse assemblage of pollinators, but in Samoa it is pollinated only by Pteropus tonganus (Megachiroptera:  Pteropodidae)-an example of a plant exclusively dependent on one bat species for pollination.  The pollination system is dystrophic, however, since foraging flying foxes may destroy up to 50 percent of C. pentandra flowers and developing fruits.  Though resource defense is regarded as rare in nectarivorous bats, P. tonganus vigorously defends small feeding territories on the rich, but readily depleted, C, pentandra nectar resource.  This intraspecies conflict probably shapes patterns of pollen transfer within and among trees, and enhances cross-pollination.  Our study highlights the importance of conserving pollinators in remote oceanic islands with depauperate pollinator faunas.

AB To investigate the importance of the epiphyte community to ecosystem nutrient cycling, we assessed the standing crop, input rates, and turnover rates of litterfall derived from epiphytic material and compared them to litterfall derived from terrestrially rooted material in a neotropical cloud forest in Monteverde, Costa Rica.  The standing crop of fallen epiphytic material in 1988 was 0.5 t ha-1 and 0.3 t ha-1 in 1990.  Annual input of fallen epiphytic material was 0.5 t ha-1, more than two times as much as has been reported for other tropical cloud forests.  This is equivalent to 5-10 percent of total fine litter at the site (7.5 t ha-1).  Nutrient input from epiphytic material was (kg ha-1 yr-1):  N, 7.5 (7% of nutrient transfer via total fine litter); P, 0.5 (8%); Ca, 4.2 (4%); Mg, 0.8 (5%); and K, 0.1 (1%).  Assuming a steady state condition in this old-growth forest, epiphyte-derived litter biomass had a higher annual decay rate (K(a) = 1.3) than did litter derived from terrestrially rooted plants (0.7).  However, turnover time (1/K(a)) of all nutrients except K in fallen epiphytic material was four to six times slower than for nutrients in terrestrially rooted material; K was tenfold faster.  Over half of the fallen epiphytic material was collected in less than 2 percent of the collections, indicating the deposition of epiphytic material is highly sporadic in space and time and must be measured at the appropriate spatial scale.

Both watersheds had the same vegetational characteristics.  Dacryodes excelsa, Sloanea berteriana, and Guarea guidonia were the most important trees in the overstory.  A profile diagram, chi-square criterion, and multivariate techniques showed the same result:  trees were related significantly to topographic variables.  Large trees, especially the dominant species, tabonuco, were associated significantly with ridges and slopes.  Size-class distributions of individual species varied as a function of broad ecological factors such as topography and disturbance regime.  Past anthropogenic disturbance was still apparent in the pattern of distribution of large trees along the elevational gradients of the watersheds.  Dacryodes excelsa is the dominant species, even though Sloanea berteriana has higher representation in smaller size-classes.

AB Clone structure, growth characteristics, and reproductive behavior of individual ramets and clones were investigated over a 3 yr period for Geonoma congesta ("cana de danta"), an abundant understory palm of the Atlantic lowland forest in Costa Rica.  The 0.6 ha study area contained 123 clones.  Mean clone size was 7.1 ramets; only 3 percent of the clones sampled had more than 20 ramets.  Within a clone, new ramets are produced sporadically, 1 to 4 ramets at a time.  Ramet mortality is often associated with physical damage from falling trees, lianas, and branches.  Less than 30 percent of the ramets with stems were erect.  Over 58 percent of stemmed ramets were bent or otherwise leaning; whereas, 11.6 percent had been forcibly smashed to the ground.  Ramets produced on average 10.1 new leaves and abscised 9.7 leaves in 3 yr.  Rates of leaf production and leaf abscission did not vary significantly among ramet stage classes.  Stem elongation was greatest in shorter, younger ramets.  In taller, older ramets, leaf size and number decreased over the study period.  Reproductive clones comprised 64 percent of the clones in 1986; whereas, only 24 percent of individual ramets reproduced.  Ramets that reproduced every year had significantly larger leaves and substantially greater crown leaf area than the other reproductive classes.  Stage classes with the greatest frequency of reproduction exhibited the greatest decrease in both crown size and leaf size.  Individual ramets are estimated to live an average of 60-70 yr; whereas, clones may persist for 100 yr or more.  The growth form of Genoma congesta ensures that clones persist despite a high incidence of ramet mortality and damage.  Moreover, at least one ramet within a clone is likely to reproduce every year, although individual ramets may not reproduce every year.  Patterns of growth and reproduction in G. congesta are consistent with the hypothesis that the growth of young, deeply shaded sprouts is supplemented by production from older, taller stems.

AB The production of leaves, inflorescences, and growth rates were measured during 1985 for 547 plants of Espeletia barclayana, a giant rosette species in the high Andes of Colombia.  There were differences in leaf production between individuals of different sizes, with a maximum for plants 61-90 cm in height (27.9 leaves yr-1) and a minimum for plants less than 30 cm (5.1 leaves yr-1).  For plants more than 61 cm in height there was a minimum in leaf production during February, coinciding with the minimum in rainfall and also during June coinciding with a decrease in rainfall, low temperature, and a peak in fog and condensation.  There was a great variation in the number of reproductive plants from one year to the next.  There was also a positive relationship between total production of inflorescences at the population level and annual rainfall.  Trunk growth rates ranged from 1.1 cm yr-1 for plants less than 30 cm in height to 3.8 cm yr-1 for plants 61-90 cm in height.  The tallest plant in the population (150 cm) was about 93 yr old.  The results of this study suggest that E. barclayana is subject to seasonal drought and that the variation in water supply and temperature have an effect on leaf production and probably on growth rates.  Because of the very slow growth rates of E. barclayana, it will take a considerable time to recover the actual population and vegetation structure of those areas which have been turned into agricultural fields.

AB Flowering and fruiting phenology were studied for thorn woodland (annual precipitation of 1179 mm) and thorn scrub (annual precipitation of 578 mm) stands in northeastern Venezuela.  The global phenology of each vegetation type was assessed using multivariate techniques (ordination and chronological clustering).  All species and their respective phenophases were analyzed simultaneously.  The flowering of trees and tall shrubs occurred in both vegetation types at the end of the dry season and lasted throughout the entire rainy season.  Short-duration rains late in the dry season may have triggered and synchronized flowering.  Fruiting activities of trees and tall shrubs occurred in all months, whereas fruiting maturation was limited to the dry season and the beginning of the rainy season.  The fluctuation in the abundance of fruits was related principally to the production of a large amount of dry, lightweight seeds during the dry season, whereas fleshy and dry, heavyweight fruits were more or less steadily produced throughout the year.  This suggests an adaptation to favor wind dispersion of seeds during the dry season when the vegetation is leafless, as well as the maintenance of animal populations as dispersal agents throughout the year.  Periods of similar phenological characteristics were statistically defined and compared to annual rainfall and soil moisture.  Annual reproductive phenology was more synchronized for thorn scrub than for thorn woodland.  This may be due to the fact that thorn scrub vegetation is subjected to more severe drought conditions and consequently responds more punctually to the reappearance of rain or soil moisture.

TI COMPETITION, RESOURCE USE AND HABITAT SELECTION IN 2 INTRODUCED HAWAIIAN
   MANNIKINS
SO BIOTROPICA
LA English
DT Article
ID COEXISTENCE
AB We analyzed patterns in geographic distribution and resource use for two species of introduced mannikins (Aves:  Estrildidae) in four urban parks across southern Oahu, Hawaii.  Both species fed exclusively on grass seeds.  Resource levels (i.e., the density of grass stems) cycled continously in the parks due to alternating management practices (i.e., watering and mowing).  Both species were common in urban parks during summer months but not during winter.
   During summer, both species increased significantly as resource levels increased.  Nutmeg Mannikins (Lonchura punctulata) occurred in all parks but were rare in those parks where Chestnut Mannikins (Lonchura malacca) were common.  This was true even when resource levels between parks did not differ significantly.  We interpreted this as evidence for competition between these species.
   We also tested two specific predictions of the shared-preference model of density-dependent habitat selection.  According to this model both species should occur together in a park only when the density of grass seeds in that park is high.  A second prediction of the model is that at low resource levels only one species (i.e., the behaviorally dominant species) should occur.  Both of these predictions failed.  We observed both species together in parks only rarely, and in some cases of coexistence resource levels were quite low.  Each species was seen by itself in at least one park.

TI SEXUAL SELECTION AND SEXUAL DIMORPHISM IN THE HARLEQUIN BEETLE
   ACROCINUS-LONGIMANUS
SO BIOTROPICA
LA English
DT Article
ID NATURAL-SELECTION; CHARACTERS; EVOLUTION; SYSTEMS
AB To investigate the causes of striking sexual dimorphism in the harlequin beetle (Acrocinus longimanus), we carried out a study of the behavior and morphology of two widely separated populations (in French Guiana and Panama).  Males of this species possess greatly elongated forelegs which exhibit strong positive allometry with body size (elytra length).  Males use their forelegs in fights with other males and in guarding females and oviposition sites.  Field data on fighting and mating success suggest that sexual selection favors large size in males.  However, the direct targets of selection were masked by high correlation between traits of the elytra, forelegs, and antennae.  Sexual selection appears to be driven by intense male competition to monopolize suitable sites for egg deposition.  Female harlequin beetles are highly selective in choosing only recently dead or dying trees for oviposition (Moraceae and Apocynaceae).  Despite marked geographic variation in coloration, host trees, and climate, the two populations did not differ in mean size and extent of sexual dimorphism.  We suggest that sexual selection in this species is sufficiently intense to override any effects of differing ecological factors.

TI PHYSICAL ASPECTS OF HURRICANE HUGO IN PUERTO-RICO
SO BIOTROPICA

DT Article
AB On 18 September 1989 the western part of Hurricane Hugo crossed eastern Puerto Rico and the Luquillo Experimental Forest (LEF).  Storm-facing slopes on the northeastern part of the island that were within 15 km of the eye and received greater than 200 mm of rain were most affected by the storm.  In the LEF and nearby area, recurrence intervals associated with Hurricane Hugo were 50 yr for wind velocity, 10 to 31 yr for stream discharge, and 5 yr for rainfall intensity.  To compare the magnitudes of the six hurricanes to pass over Puerto Rico since 1899, 3 indices were developed using the standardized values of the product of:  the maximum sustained wind speed at San Juan squared and storm duration; the square of the product of the maximum sustained wind velocity at San Juan and the ratio of the distance between the hurricane eye and San Juan to the distance between the eye and percentage of average annual rainfall delivered by the storm.  Based on these indices, Hurricane Hugo was of moderate intensity.  However, because of the path of Hurricane Hugo, only one of these six storms (the 1932 storm) caused more damage to the LEF than Hurricane Hugo.  Hurricanes of Hugo's magnitude are estimated to pass over the LEF once every 50-60 yr, on average.

DT Article
AB Hurricane Hugo caused low to moderate damage to a flood plain forest that was partially protected by its topographic position.  Treefalls and the location of damage suggested N to NW wind direction during the storm.  Thirty percent of the trees, or 693 trees/ha, had some damage and 84 percent of the damage was to the canopy.  Most of the damage to trees was caused by direct wind impact (83%) as opposed to secondary effects (16%).  Over 80 percent of the snapped, leaning, and uprooted trees were dicotyledonous.  Tree mortality was only 1 percent, and most of the damage to the sierra palm Prestoea montana (R. Grah.) Nichols was loss of leaves.  Rapid refoliation, epicormic branching, adventitious root production, resprouting, and regeneration from seed in open areas were observed nine months after the event.  Ten percent of the aboveground biomass and 12-16 percent of the nutrient stocks (N, P, K, Ca, Mg) were transferred to the forest floor, mostly in the form of woody biomass and nutrient-rich leaves.  Palm leaves were the dominant leaf component of necromass.  Instantaneous in situ fine and coarse necromass production was 10 and 9.2 Mg/ha, respectively.  Net changes in aboveground mass, N, P, K, Ca, and Mg (in percent of prehurricane value) were 8, 3, 0, 3, 12, and 1, respectively, in spite of a high rate of loss by export.  The source of additional mass and nutrients were holes from upland forests that fell into and remained inside the flood plain.

AB On 18 September 1989 Hurricane Hugo defoliated large forested areas of northeastern Puerto Rico.  In two severely damaged subtropical wet forest sites, a mean of 1006-1083 g/m2, or 419-451 times the mean daily input of fine litter (leaves, small wood, and miscellaneous debris) was deposited on the forest floor.  An additional 928 g/m2 of litter was suspended above the ground.  A lower montane rain forest site received 682 times the mean daily fine litterfall.  The concentrations of N and P in the hurricane leaf litter ranged from 1.1 to 1.5 and 1.7 to 3.3 times the concentrations of N and P in normal leaffall, respectively.  In subtropical wet forest, fine litterfall from the hurricane contained 1.3 and 1.5-2.4 times the mean annual litterfall inputs of N and P, respectively.  These sudden high nutrient inputs apparently altered nutrient cycling.

AB Fine root dynamics were evaluated at four sites in a subtropical wet forest in Puerto Rico over a period of 13 months following disturbance by Hurricane Hugo in September 1989.  Live fine root standing stocks (to a depth of 10 cm) declined to zero over a three month period after the hurricane and fluctuated greatly thereafter.  Maximum fine root biomass (49 g/cm3) occurred in June 1990.  Dead root standing stocks (mean 423 g/m2) were relatively constant through the study period.  Recovery of fine roots following the initial hurricane-related montality appears to be a slow process, regulated at least initially by environmental factors such as precipiration.

AB On 21 September 1989 Hurricane Hugo struck the South Carolina Coast, causing a storm surge of 5 to 8 m.  At the North Inler Long-Term Ecological Research site, this salt water surge inundated the forest > 150 m from the marsh edge with over 3 m of salt water.  Two days after the storm, water standing on the forest floor had an average salinity of 21 parts per thousand.  Significant changes in forest soils occurred.  Two weeks prior to the storm, soil total ionic conrent (TIC) ranged from 1.6 to 3.4 meq/liter.  Two days after the storm, TlC was 227 to 778 meq/liter or 2.3 to 12 parts per thousand salinity.  Four months after IIugo, TIC remained elevated by 58 to 142 times.  Dominant ions (Na.1 and Cl-) in soil solution increased in importance in the overall ionic budget.  After Hugo, Na1 and Cl- accounted for > 76 to 81 percent (Bh and A horizons, respectively) of the ion balance:  in 1986 Na+ and Cl- accounted for 52 to 72 percent (mineral soil and Bh horizons, respectively).  Ammonium and hydrogen ion mobilization accompanied increased ionic strength of soil solutions.  Following the storm, ammonium in soil solution from the A horizon increased from < 0.1-mu-eq/l (annual average for 1986) to a maximum of 178-mu-eq/l 5 d after the storm.  Increased ammonium concentrations were detected for mineral soil solution (5.6-fold increase) and B horizon soil solution (115-fold increase) over the 1986 concentrations.  Ammonium concentrations in water standing on the forest floor reached 1764-mu-eq/l with soil solutions in the A horizon (1000-mu-eq/l) and Bh horizon (557-mu-eq/l) increasing concurrently.  Maximum mineral soil solution concentrations were detected 2 mo after the storm at 386-mu-eq/l.  Hurricanes with salt inundation decrease nutrient use efficiency through the rapid loss of leaves without reabsorption of the nitrogen, decrease nitrogen retention through decreased uptake potential by vegetation and microbial immobilization, and decrease physiochemical retention mechanisms (absorption of ammonium ion on exchange sites) by swamping exchange sites with salt catious.

AB We examined the effects of two disturbances (Hurricane Hugo and forest clearcutting) on soil nitrogen dynamics and on the exchanges of N2O, CO2, and CH4 between soils and the atmosphere of a subtropical wet forest in Puerto Rico.  The disturbances resulted in prolonged increases in ammonium pools and short-term increases in rates of net N-mineralization and net nitrification.  Nitrous oxide emissions increased following both disturbances.  The most dramatic increase was observed 4 mo after clearcutting; N2O emissions (109.49-mu-g N/m2-hr) from the cut plot were about two orders of magnitude higher than emissions from the reference plot (1.71-mu-g N/m2-hr).  Carbon dioxide emissions from both disturbed plots (mean 102.47 mg C/m2-hr) were about 30 percent lower than the reference (mean 151.28 mg C/m2-hr).  Soils at all sites were generally sinks for CH4.  Methane uptake, however, was suppressed by both disturbances.  This suppression may be related to disturbance-induced changes in the nitrogen cycle, as we have previously observed in temperate zone forests.

ID TROPICAL FOREST
AB The forests and soils at Luquillo Experimental Forest (LEF), Puerto Rico, are frequently disturbed by hurricanes occurring at various frequencies and intensities. We have derived a forest version of the Century soil organic matter model to examine the impact of hurricanes on soil nutrient availability and pool sizes, and forest productivity in the tabonuco forest at Luquillo. The model adequately predicted aboveground plant production, soil carbon, and soil nitrogen levels for forest conditions existing before Hurricane Hugo. Simulations of Hurricane Hugo and of an historical sequence of hurricanes indicated a complex pattern of recovery, especially for the first 10 yr after the hurricanes. After repeated hurricanes, forest biomass was reduced, while forest productivity was enhanced. Soil organic matter, and phosphorus and nitrogen mineralization stabilized at higher levels for the LEF than for hurricane-free tabonuco forest, and organic soil phosphorus was substantially increased by hurricanes. Results from these simulations should be regarded as hypotheses. At present there is insufficient data to validate the results of hurricane model simulations.

TI SUMMARY OF ECOSYSTEM-LEVEL EFFECTS OF CARIBBEAN HURRICANES
SO BIOTROPICA
LA English
DT Article
AB Effects of Hurricane Hugo on forest ecosystem processes in Puerto Rico and South Carolina are summarized from six research papers presented in this issue.  Hurricanes are major catastrophic disturbances capable of altering ecosystem-level processes in both the short and the long term.  The high intensity, broad scale, and relatively high frequency of these storms makes them a major agent of catastrophic disturbance in the Caribbean and the Atlantic seaboard of the U.S.A. (Scarena & Larsen 1991).  Although the return frequency of hurricanes for any given area is low (on the order of years or decades; Fig. 2 in Walker et al. 1991) relative to the lifespan of an individual investigator or a typical research project, the return time is shorter than the life span of a canopy tree or a forest ecosystem.  Hurricanes have struck the Caribbean repeatedly within recorded history (Scatena & Larsen 1991, Walker et al. 1991), and have surely played a role in shaping plant population dynamics (e.g., Lugo et al. 1983), soil development (Scatena & Larsen 1991) and nutrient cycling (Sanford et al. 1991) over evolutionary time scales (thousands of years) in much of the Caribbean.
   Out paper summarizes the six preceding research papers in this issue, and focuses on the short-term changes in nutrient cycling induced by Hurricane Hugo, as well as the possible long-term consequences of such disturbances on tropical forests.  Data on biomass and nutrient fluxes caused by Hurricane Gilbert in Quintana Roo, Mexico (Whigham et al. 1991, Plant Section, this issue) are included, but the discussion is primarily focused on two Long-Term Ecological Research sites funded by the National Science Foundation:  the Luquillo Experimental Forest (LEF) in Puerto Rico and the North Inler site in South Carolina.  The processes summarized below are:  hurricane litterfall and associated nutrient fluxes and exports; salinization of coastal soils from storm surge and associated changes in soil chemistry; fine root dynamics after disturbance; changes in soil nutrient pools and fertility; and, hurricane-induced changes in nitrogen (N) transformations and fluxes.

AB Hurricane Hugo struck Puerto Rico on 18 September 1989 with maximum sustained winds of over 166 km/hr (Scarena & Larsen 1991) and caused severe defoliation of 56 percent of the trees in study plots at El Verde in the Luquillo Experimental Forest (LEF).  Some trees were uprooted (9%) or had trunks that snapped (11%), but overall mortality was low (7%).  Damage was patchy on twenty 300 m2 plots with most damage occurring on north-facing sites.  Tall trees and trees with large diameters were most likely to be uprooted, but successional status of trees was not a good predictor of the amount of damage the trees sustained.  Recovery patterns varied among species but refoliation was rapid.  Widespread sprouring and minimal breakage of large branches will probably lead to the recovery of most trees.

ID MONTANE RAIN-FOREST; PRODUCTIVITY; DENSITY; TREE
AB Hurricane Hugo struck Puerto Rico on 18 September 1989 and radically altered the canopy structure of forests in the Luquillo Mountains.  We measured canopy structure before and after the hurricane in hectare-sized plots of "tabonuco forest" (subtropical wet forest) at 350 m elevation, "colorado forest" (lower montane wet forest) at 750 m, and "cloud forest" (lower montane rain forest) at 1000 m.  In all three plots the chief effect of the hurricane was to reduce significantly the vegetation cover in upper height intervals.  Foliage profiles (showing percent vegetation cover in height intervals above ground) changed significantly, average maximum canopy height decreased (by as much as 50%), and the amount of low canopy area (vegetation less-than-or-equal-to 2 m high) markedly increased (up to 60-fold) in all three plots.  In the colorado forest plot the hurricane caused more damage on ridges than in valleys; whereas, the cloud forest plot sustained equal damage on windward and leeward slopes.  Overall, the hurricane altered forest structure so much that forest composition and dynamics could be affected for many years.  Local variation in hurricane damage can contribute to forest complexity in the Luquillo Mountains.

ID RAIN-FOREST; COSTA-RICA; ENVIRONMENTS; TREES
AB The changes in light availability in the understory of a subtropical wet forest (Luquillo Experimental Forest, Puerto Rico) were monitored after the passage of Hurricane Hugo on 18 September 1989. Gallium arsenide phosphide sensors were placed 1 m apart along a 32 m transect. Data were collected for periods of 7-10 d in October and December 1989, and in March, July, and November 1990. Daily histograms were generated for observations of photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) taken every two seconds. Mean total daily PPFD was calculated for each sensor in each data set. During the 14 mo after the passage of the hurricane, the PPFD showed a highly skewed distribution with most values < 200-mu-mol m-2 s-1. The maximum spatial heterogeneity was observed in July 1990 because of the shading of some sensors by the growing pioneer vegetation. Median values of total daily PPFD for ten months after the hurricane ranged from 7.7 to 10.8 mol m-2 d-1, which is similar to values previously observed for large (> 400 m2) treefall gaps. Median total daily PPFD fell to 0.8 mol m-2 d-1 in November 1990 because of almost complete coverage of the transect by a canopy of Cecropia schreheriana Miq. ex. C. peltata. An analysis of semivariance was used to discern patterns of autocorrelation in total daily PPFD along the transect. Through March 1990 patches of high and low light separated by distances of 10-12 m were detected. By July 1990 the patchiness was replaced by a pattern that showed no autocorrelation at distances of 1 m or greater.

DT Article
ID RAINFOREST
AB Changes in the population structure and recruitment characteristics of Manilkara bidentata populations were investigated at two sites (El Verde & Bisley) in the Luquillo Experimental Forest (LEF), at one month and nine months after Hurricane Hugo.  Fatal damage occurred to 4 percent of the trees at the El Verde site.  Severe damage to mature trees disrupted seed production.  Sixty percent of the young seedling population was destroyed, mainly as a result of burial by litter.  For surviving seedlings, the posthurricane growth rate (in height) of old seedlings was 2 cm/mo, 17 times greater than that under prehurricane conditions.  The prehurricane population of young seedlings had a large number of individuals and a long transition period (over 14 yr); whereas, the posthurricane population had fewer individuals and a shorter transition period (less than 2 yr).  Increased growth rates of seedlings were related to increased light at the forest floor.  The recruitment rate of the Manikara population from the seedling size class into the sapling size class was greater than that under prehurricane conditions.  Rapid adjustment to posthurricane conditions, high tree survival, and increased number of seedlings recruited into larger size classes may increase the abundance of Manilkara trees in the forest.  These adaptations are especially significant in the LEF and other forests which experience frequent hurricane disturbances.  Based upon the effects of Hurricane Hugo, it appears that hurricanes play an important role in releasing suppressed seedling growth of Manilkara populations and that hurricanes may contribute to the abundance of Manilkara trees in the LEF.

AB We studied the dynamics of the seedling community in the Luquillo Experimental Forest during one year following Hurricane Hugo, to look at the effect of three litter treatments (continuous litter removal, unaltered litter quantity [control] and continuous litter addition), on seedling emergence, growth, density, and mortality.  Total seedling densities (for both newly emerged and established seedlings) were highest in the litter removal treatment, suggesting that litter is a major constraint to recruitment of seedlings.  However, species differed in their responses to the three treatments:  species characteristic of early succession (Chionantbus domingensis and Cecropia schreberiana ex. C. peltata) were densest in the litter removal treatment, while densities of species characteristic of late succession either did not increase (Sloanea berteriana) or declined (Dacryodes excelsa) in the litter removal treatment.  Height growth was lowest and mortality generally highest for seedlings in the litter removal treatment.  Variability in species responses to litter after the hurricane may lead to changes in the species composition of the forest.

AB Hurricanes frequently affect the forests of St. John, U.S. Virgin Islands, but there has been little study of their effects on the island's vegetation.  Hurricane Hugo hir St. John on 17-18 September 1989.  Six weeks later damage was assessed in three plots on the island (1.0 or 0.5 ha; in subtropical moist and subtropical dry life zones) that were established and inventoried before the hurricane.  Most damage involved loss of small branches; loss of major limbs, crown loss, tip-ups, and snapped stems were less common.  Taller and larger diameter trees were usually more severely damaged than shorter and smaller diameter trees; forests on slopes facing hurricane winds were damaged more than leeward forests; low elevations received more damage than higher elevations within each forest plot.  Overall, damage to vegetation seemed minor, judging from the relative number of stems in different classes of damage severity.

Results of this sampling confirmed our hypotheses that the amount and nature of hurricane wind damage differed among the tree species sampled.  Approximately 73 percent of the 16,870 trees inventoried were either not damaged or had light crown damage.  Longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) was less damaged than loblolly pine (Pinus Iaeda) or pond pine (Pinus serolina).  Bald cypress (Taxodium distichum) suffered light crown damage.  Upland oaks were more heavily damaged than the pine species.  Live oak (Quercus virginiana) was less damaged than lautel oak (Quercus Laurifolia) and water oak (Quercus nigra).  Those tree species commonly found in the lower coastal plain (longleaf pine, bald cypress, and live oak) suffered less damage than species with larger natural ranges.

AB Patterns of damage caused to trees greater-than-or-equal-to 3 cm dbh in Jamaican montane rain forests by Hurricane Gilbert were described in a series of permanent plots over a study area of 2.5 km2, sampling 0.3 ha.  Damage was assessed in the plots 19-23 mo after the hurricane.  Low overall levels of damage occurred compared with studies of hurricane damage elsewhere; stem mortality = 8.1 +/- 1.4 percent; uprooted stems = 5.8 +/- 1.3 percent; broken stems = 8.5 +/- 1.2 percent.  The highest levels of damage were found on southern slopes and the ridge crest of the Blue Mountains, as the range protected forests on the northern slopes from the full force of the hurricane, which struck from the southeast, However, mortality and uprooting did not conform to a pattern that could be linked to topography.  I conclude that while hurricanes are fairly frequent events in Jamaica (return period ca 15 yr), their effective return periods to particular areas of forest are likely to be longer because of local differences in exposure.

AB Hurricane Gilbert struck the northeastern portion of the Yucaran Peninsula in an area where we have been conducting studies of the vegetation and avifauna in a dry tropical forest since 1984.  All trees in our study area were completely defoliated and most suffered heavy structural damage.  Although few trees were killed outright, many died over the next 17 months, especially those that had been heavily damaged.  Tree recovery was rapid as relative diameter growth for most species for the first year after the hurricane were greater than average diameter growth rates for three of the five prehurricane years.  Biomass of litterfall (leaves and wood less than 10 cm in diameter) and nutrients generated by the hurricane exceeded the totals produced during any of the five previous years.  The hurricane increased the mass and nutrients in coarse woody debris (wood greater than 10 cm in diameter) by approximately 50 percent.  Mortality caused by fire was much greater than morrality caused by the hurricane.

AB We report the first data on changes in tropical scream biora resulting from a major hurricane.  Beginning in January 1989, we trapped freshwater shrimp, Atya lanipes, along 1200 m of a montane stream in the Luquillo Experimental Forest, Puerto Rico.  Prior to Hurricane Hugo, shrimp densities were greater in the headwaters than at mid- and low elevation.  In October 1989, one month after the hurricane, shrimp densities were reduced on average by 50 percent in the headwaters (apparently from washout) and increased by 80 percent at mid-elevation.  From December 1989 to May 1990 overall shrimp densities increased rapidly to the highest abundances ever recorded.  These densities most likely resulted from increased numbers of shrimp that migrated upstream from riverine pools; and, from increased availability of unusually abundant food resources (decomposing leaves and algae) that increased recruitment of these generalized consumers.  Benthic communities in forested, headwater streams are likely to be resilient after intermediate levels of disturbance, because rapid debris-dam formation increases retention of food resources and reduces washout of invertebrate consumers.  However, storms generating greater stream flow and/or less wind than Hurricane Hugo could cause extensive, longer-lasting decreases of benthic-dwelling shrimp because of greater washout of both consumers and food supplies.

AB Although the importance of disturbance regimes in affecting ecosystem structure and function is becoming an accepted paradigm in ecology, the consequences of catastrophic events are poorly understood.  On 18 September 1989 Hurricane Hugo struck Puerto Rico, with the center of the hurricane passing within ten kilometers of the Luquillo Experimental Forest.  This provided a rare opportunity to document direct and indirect effects of a natural disturbance of high intensity, large scale, but low frequency on selected aspects of animal ecology.  The densities and spatial distributions of six species of common invertebrates (four snails, Caracolus caracolla, Polydonates acutangula, Nenia tridens, and Gaeotis nigrolineata, and two walking sticks, Lamponius portoricensis and Agamemmon iphimedeia) in the tabonuco rain forest were estimated before and after the hurricane.  Circular quadrats (radius = 5 m; area = 78.54 m2) were established at each of 40 points in the Bisley watersheds.  Numbers of individuals of each species were counted during nighttime surveys and densities were compared before and after the hurricane via paired t-tests.  Both species of walking stick and three of the four species of snail exhibited statistically significant reductions in density after the hurricane.  Densities of N. tridens, G. nigrolineata, and A. iphimedeia were reduced to the point that no specimens were detected in posthurricane surveys.  In fact, all species of invertebrates were so rare after the hurricane that comparisons of spatial distribution were only possible for C. caracolla, and its distribution was significantly less clumped after Hurricane Hugo (G-test).  At the Bisley watersheds, all size categories of C. caracolla suffered similar reductions in density; no significant alteration in size distribution was detected after the hurricane (G-test).

Individually marked Eleutherodactylus coqui were monitored in two study plots from January 1987 through October 1990.  Survivorship estimates of adults for the period including the storm were within the normal range from previous years.  Juveniles suffered severe reductions, primarily among the smaller size classes.  By October 1990 adult population density had increased fourfold over prehurricane levels, although adults were smaller.  Juvenile numbers also appeared to be increasing, but had not yet reached prehurricane densities.  The rapid increase in density may have resulted from an increase in retreat sites and a decrease in invertebrate predators.  Auditory censuses suggested that density changes for other species ranged from a 14 percent increase for the relatively common E. hedricki to an 83 percent decrease for the relatively rare E. richmondi.

Anolis stratulus, a canopy species, responded to changes in the distribution of suitable habitat structure while A. gundlachi, a forest interior species, apparently responded to changes in microclimate.  One year posthurricane, A. stratulus had begun reinvasion of the forest canopy, and relative abundances of species at ground level proceeded toward prehurricane values.  One year posthurricane, the total anoline minimum density at ground level was still substantially lower than prehurricane levels.

AB Hurricane Hugo caused severe but short-term disruption of the avian community of a subtropical wet forest site in the Luquillo Mountains of Puerto Rico.  Nectarivorous and frugivorous bird species were greatly reduced in numbers immediately after the hurricane.  The single granivore species studied decreased in numbers more slowly.  Insectivores and omnivores increased after the hurricane.  All species except the granivore returned to their prehurricane abundance levels prior to the following breeding season, suggesting that population changes were a result of movement in search of food rather than mortality.  Mist net captures and observations indicated that birds occupied a reduced vertical foraging range after the hurricane, and stomach contents from birds captured 6-10 months after the hurricane showed that different foods were being consumed.  Fewer and different kinds of arthropods were found in stomachs after the hurricane.  These findings, coupled with the frequent occurrence of hurricanes in the Caribbean, suggest that there is pressure on bird populations in this region to maintain plasticity in habitat and dietary requirements.

AB Bird populations were surveyed in Virgin Islands National Park, St. John, U.S. Virgin Islands in 1987 (two years before.  Hurricane Hugo hit the Virgin Islands) and in 1990 (four months after the hurricane).  Abundance was estimated using the fixed-radius point count method.  The average number of individual permanent residents per survey point was significantly lower after the hurricane in both moist forest and dry evergreen woodland.  Most of the resident species that showed substantial population declines feed primarily on fruit or nectar, a pattern which is consistent with the results of several other recent studies of the effect of hurricanes on forest bird communities.  Also, an insectivorous winter resident (Parula americana) had significantly lower densities after the hurricane.  Although many areas within the park were defoliated after the hurricane, most trees remained standing and they began to produce new leaves within a few weeks.  Our results suggest that even relatively mild storm damage can result in a marked reduction in the numbers of some species of birds due either to mortality or dispersal from the affected area.

TI EFFECTS OF HURRICANE GILBERT ON BIRDS IN A DRY TROPICAL FOREST IN THE
   YUCATAN PENINSULA
SO BIOTROPICA
LA English
DT Article
AB On 14 September 1988 Hurricane Gilbert, the strongest tropical storm ever recorded in the Western Hemisphere, passed through an area of tropical forest in Quintana Roo, Mexico, where I had been studying winter bird populations since 1984.  The hurricane defoliated the forest, and created a nearly impenetrable rangle of fallen branches and vines at ground level.  Point counts and mist-netting conducted 5-6 mo after the storm revealed an influx of field- and shrub-associated bird species.  Most previously common insectivores and feeding generalists were present in February-March 1989, but many had declined significantly in abundance.  Resident frugivores and nectarivores were especially scarce after the hurricane.  Wildfires that swept through northeastern Quintana Roo in the summer of 1989 had a greater effect on birds than did the storm itself.  By late winter 1990 the bird community within unburned forest was clearly converging toward its prehurricane composition.  In contrast, the bird community in burned forest resembled that associated with recently abandoned agricultural fields and pastures.  As a group, overwintering nearctic migrants appeared to be more resilient than year-round residents to the effects of both the hurricane and the associated fires.

TI BIRDS OF A SEVERELY HURRICANE-DAMAGED ATLANTIC COAST RAIN-FOREST IN
   NICARAGUA
SO BIOTROPICA

DT Article
AB On 22 October 1988 Hurricane Joan severely damaged 500,000 ha of lowland tropical rain forest in southeastern Nicaragua near Bluefields.  An expedition in February 1989 detected virtually no birds in formerly forested sites, although standing trunks that had been snapped were resprouting and the forest appeared to be recovering.  In March 1990 I observed birds along rivers and at a secondary forest site and surveyed and mist-netted birds at three sites reported to be largely mature forest before they were damaged by the hurricane.  I recorded a total of 161 species throughout the hurricane-damaged region.  In seven days at the regenerating forest sites, I recorded 113 species of birds, a species richness comparable to undamaged lowland forest I visited six months later near the Rio Sanra Cruz, Nicaragua.  Mist net capture rates at the damaged sites suggested overall bird abundance similar to that of a comparable lowland) rain forest at La Selva, Costa Rica, but the typical habitats of mist-netted frugivores differed significantly between the two areas:  the hurricane-damaged sites had proportionately fewer captures of species typical of the forest interior.  Most of the birds encountered in the hurricane-damaged forest were species typical of forest edge, forest canopy, and second-growth habitats; only 19 species were birds typical of the forest interior, and only two were exclusively so.  Woodcreepers, forest antibirds, and furnaiids, families characteristic of lowland rain forest, were notably absent or under-represented.  Overall forest structure appeared to be important in determining the species composition of the reappearing bird community.

AB Hurricanes are common, potentially catastrophic events for ecosystems in the Caribbean.  We synthesize the work reported in this issue, together with the existing literature, to discuss effects of hurricanes on Caribbean ecosystems and to highlight priorities for future work.  Comparisons of the impacts of hurricanes on different ecosystems are made difficult by the lack of detailed meterological data, lack of prehurricane ecological data and differences between studies in types and timing of measurements made.
   Effects of recent hurricanes on Caribbean forest ecosystems include:  defoliation, ranging from complete in lowland wet forest in Nicaragua after Hurricane Joan to negligible in parts of Jamaican montane forest after Hurricane Gilbert; felling of trees by uprooting and snapping (80% in Nicaragua to 14% in Jamaica); and tree mortality, which is rarely recorded and generally low (13% in the Yucatan following Hurricane Gilbert to 3% in Puerto Rican montane forests following Hurricane Hugo).  Damage to individual trees varies with topographic location, stand characteristics, tree size (large ones uprooting and small ones snapping in Dominica during Hurricane David, but not in Jamaica), and species characteristics (such as wood density), but it is difficult to generalize about these factors.
   Effects on animal populations are both direct and through reductions in food supplies.  Frugivorous and nectarivorous birds were more severely affected than insectivorous species in the Virgin Islands and Jamaica.  There is little information about hurricane effects on insect populations, but populations of two species of walking sticks in Puerto Rico declined sharply after Hurricane Hugo.  Numbers of adults of one frog species in Puerto Rico quadrupoled after Hurricane Hugo, but numbers of juveniles were severely reduced by the storm.
   Effects of hurricanes on the physical environment include modified microclimates due to increased light penetration through defoliated canopies and landslides triggered by rainfall.  Increased litterfall led to increases in some soil nutrients, and fine root biomass was drastically reduced in a Puerto Rican montane forest.
   Recovery of forest ecosystems from hurricanes depends on a combination of seedling growth and resprouting of canopy trees.  In several studies, seed germination was promoted by higher light and/or higher temperature, but seedling mortality also increased.  The relative importance of newly germinated seedlings, advance regeneration, and regrowth of damaged adults has not been studied.  The few long-term studies of adult trees show the expected decline in the proportion of pioneer and intolerant species with time after disturbance.
   Hurricanes may be the most important factor controlling species composition and some aspects of ecosystem dynamics in the Caribbean; there is much still to be learned, and we suggest some priorities for future research.

SO BIOTROPICA
LA English
DT Article
AB Dilute geothermal springs of the sodium-chloride-bicarbonate type modify the chemistry of receiving screams draining La Selva Biological Reserve in the Caribbean lowlands of Costa Rica.  Streams receiving geothermal waters are solute-rich and co-occur with solute-poor streams that do not receive geothermal inputs.  Geothermal waters contain significantly greater concentrations of Ca, Fe, Mg, Na, Si, Cl, SO4, soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), and total phosphorus (TP) than waters unmodified by geothermal inputs.  Streams that do not receive geothermal inputs are solute-poor, typically containing < 10 percent relative concentration of each of the solutes mentioned above.  Most geothermal waters that have been identified to date issue near the terminus of the youngest lava flow known for La Selva.  The two major rivers of La Selva, the Salto and Suta, are both modified by inputs of geothermal waters and their main channels follow the lateral margins of the youngest lava flow, where it overlies older flows.  Discharge points of geothermal seepages appear to be determined by the shape and hydrogeological properties of the lava flows and possible faulting.  The lower watershed of the Salto River exhibits a large spatial variability in phosphorus concentration (5-250-mu-g L-1 SRP) and conductivity (25-440-mu-S cm1) that reflects the heterogeneous location of geothermal seepages.  Geothermal processes introduce natural chemical discontinuities into stream continua that can affect nutrient limitation of algal growth and potentially primary production.  In addition, geothermal upwellings represent a source of variation in soil phosphorus levels that is relatively independent of the composition of parent material in the surficial catchment and may potentially influence plant growth and demography.

AB The mangal community fringing the Grand Cul-de-Sac Matin of Guadeloupe, French West Indies is composed of Rhizophora mangle (red), Avicennia germinans (black), and Laguncularia racemosa (white mangrove).  These species form six discrete vegetation zones along a Canal Perrin transect.  A. germinans supports dense epicaulous crusts of nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria which cover the bole and even the finest branchlettes.  Crusts on red and white mangrove were less dense.  Acetylene reduction activity (ARA) recorded for these previously unreported crusts ranged from 174 to 2012 nmol C2H4.mg ChLa-1.hr-1.  The ARA in the aerial strarum represents a potentially important source of nitrogen to this mangal community.  Preliminary data showed that the 42.3 g N.m-2.yr-1 biologically fixed by cyanobacteria growing epiphyrically on Avicennia in zone IV of the Canal Perrin Transect was 3.2 times greater than the total nitrogen budget of an Avicennia community in Southern Australia.  The rate-controlling effects of crust hydration and salinity on the ARA and the recovery rate of nitrogenase activity following a period of dehydration are reported.

AB Natural history characteristics of a dominant understory bamboo (Chusquea sp.) were examined in relation to a tropical montane rain forest's structure, composition, and regeneration at timberline in north-central Peru.  Because of its small size and sun intolerance, this scandent bamboo does not aggressively preempt space aboveground by occupying canopy openings or understory clearings or belowground through rhizome growth.  Furthermore, two years of census data on > 1100 tagged trees and shrubs suggest that its presence in the understory does not affect the mortality, composition, or regeneration of the arboreal species.

AB We quantified herbivory on leaves of two mangrove species, Rhizophora mangle and Avicennia germinans, at eight sites in Belize. Amounts and types of damage were compared among three mainland sites and five mangrove cays off the coast. Several environmental and autecological factors that potentially influence herbivory were examined, including canopy cover, tree age, leaf age, ridal height, and nutrient enrichment. Herbivores damaged 4.3 percent to 25.3 percent of Rhizophora leaf area and 7.7 percent to 36.1 percent of Avicennia leaf area, figures comparable to other mangal throughout the world. On average, Avicennia was less frequently damaged than Rhizophora at all sites but one. Herbivory at a bird rookery was not significantly higher than elsewhere, indicating that nutrient enrichment of leaves did not stimulate herbivory at this site. Significant but inconsistent differences in damage were detected between the cays and mainland sites. Significant differences, dependent on tidal height, were found between seedlings and trees. Rhizophora seedlings growing under a canopy of adult conspecifics suffered twice as much damage as seedlings growing in areas where the adult canopy was removed. Damage types occurring on each species were consistent across all sites, but the two species did not share the same herbivores.

AB Floral nectars of 62 species native to south and southeast Asia were sampled opportunistically, mostly in Malaysia, and analyzed for sugar composition by HPLC.  The sugar compositions of these nectars have not been previously reported in the literature.  The distribution of the nectars in terms of percentage sucrose tended to be one of two extremes; either high sucrose or low sucrose.  Principal pollinators of only a few of these species have been hypothesized in the literature.  Most of these had nectar sugar compositions consistent with the principal pollinators posited.  A few did not.  Sugar compositions of Old World bat-pollinated species were typically found to be much richer in sucrose than those of New World bat flowers and to vary considerably.  Possible reasons for these observations are discussed.

AB Ants were sampled using pitfall traps in two replicate 1 ha plots of each of three experimental fire treatments (annually burned, biennially burned, and unburned for over 14 years) in a eucalypt-dominated savanna of tropical northern Australia. The ant fauna was extremely diverse, with 81 species from 24 genera recorded. Species were classified into functional groups based on habitat requirements and competitive interactions, with the most important groups being dominant species of Iridomyrmex (11 species, 14-63% total ants in traps); generalized myrmicines (mostly species of Monomorium and Pheidole; total of 22 species, 11-61% total ants in traps); hot climate specialists (species of Melophorus, Monomorium ("Chelaner") and Meranoplus; total of 14 species, 1-16% total ants in traps); cryptic species (many genera; total of 13 species, 2-27% total ants in traps); and, opportunists (mostly species of Rhytidoponera and Tetramorium; total of 11 species, 3-12% total ants in traps). Ant communities in the annually burned plots were characterized by relatively high numbers of dominant Iridomyrmex, hot climate specialists and opportunistic Rhytidoponera aurala, and low numbers of generalized myrimicines and cryptic species. The reverse was true for unburned plots. Many species were common under one fire regime, but were rarely or never recorded under the other. These differences were attributed to structural changes in the habitat caused by fire, and in particular to the levels of litter accumulation and insolation on the ground. These changes influenced ants directly, but also had important indirect effects through their influence on the abundance of dominant Iridomyrmex, and therefore on competitive interactions. The ant communities in the biennially burned plots were generally intermediate to those of the unburned and annually burned plots. However, one was more similar to those in the annually burned plots, while the other resembled those in the unburned plots.
   These results demonstrate that different fire regimes have a major influence on one of the most important faunal groups in tropical savannas, and this has important implications for conservation management in these ecosystems.

The traps were operated 90 km north of Manaus, Brazil in continuous terra ferme forest and forest fragments of 1, 10, and 100 ha.  Of the 16 species of euglossine bees capoured, Englosse chalybeats and Eg. stilbonota accounted for 85 percent.  The traps had the advantage of operating unattended, but their capture efficiency was low.
   Bee abundance and species richness were significantly correlated and peaked in the wet season when flowering also peaked.  Contrary to a previous study in the same area, bee abundance was greater in 10- and 100-ha fragments than in continuous forest.  Fragments of 1 ha had the smallest number of individuals and species.  It appears that male euglossine abundance may vary considerably over short distances, making it difficult to characterize a forest by sampling a single site.

AB Massive mortality of the fouling community associated with red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle L.) roots was observed in February 1989 throughout most of La Restinga, a hypersaline coastal lagoon located in the central part of Margarita Island, Venezuela.  The presence of species in the community was monitored on 6 field trips through 21 consecutive months, revealing a trend towards the restoration of the initial (May 1988) species composition.  Although the factor or factors responsible for the community changes were not identified, physical disturbances associated with the passage of hurricanes Gilbert and Joan seem to be connected with the observed massive mortality.  Apparently, the same factors and those preventing larval transport and settlement, i.e., slow water currents and siltration, are responsible for the slow community recovery.

AB Aboveground adventitious roots emerging from the stems and branches of the montane tropical rain forest canopy tree species, Ceratopetalum virchowii, do not require epiphyte mats to stimulate their growth.  The adventitious roots grow in dense clumps on fully exposed aboveground woody surfaces of this species on Mount Bellenden Ker in northeast Queensland, Australia, where mean annual rainfall exceeds 6000 mm.  While the soil at the study site is nutrient-poor, the nutrient content of the rainwater draining from the stems of C. virchowii is unusually high compared to the stemflow of other neighboring canopy tree species.  Ceratopetalum virchowii is particularly prone to the leaching of Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, and Na+.  The aboveground adventitious roots of C. virchowii, therefore, may serve the adaptive function of nutrient recovery before its nutrient-rich stemflow reaches the ground and becomes available to other plants.  I hypothesize that the growth of the aboveground adventitious roots of C. virchowii is influenced by the high nutrient content of its stemflow and branchflow drainage, and by the moist condition of its woody surfaces which remain wetted for relatively long periods after rainfalls.

Even in areas away from intensified human land use, warmer and drier climatic conditions could increase the probability of fire in tropical forests.  In this study the capacity of tree species to sprout following fire in disturbed moist tropical evergreen forests was quantified.  Additionally, mortality and the modes of survival of standing forest trees at four sites were measured.  Crown mortality ranged from 64-97 percent.  Eight months after fire, 36-69 percent of all trees present on the sites at the time of burning were dead (i.e., no sprouting occurred).  Out of 124 species measured (500 total individuals), 46 percent had the capacity to sprout from subterranean tissues and 27 percent sprouted from epicormic tissues.  Forty-one percent of the sampled species were found to lack any capacity to sprout vegetatively.  The percentage of individuals that survived by sprouting varied among tree species.  Survival of the 14 most common species encountered ranged from 15-83 percent.  Survival also varied among sites and this was primarily attributed to differences in fire severity.  Fire severity and plant mortality were greatest in selectively logged forests that were intentionally burned for pasture conversion (> 65% mortality).  One ecological advantage of sprouting over establishment from seeds is rapid regrowth and a greater capacity for exploitation of limited resources in tropical forests.  Mean sprout height was 0.8-1.6 m for 8-month old sprouts and 4.2 m for 20-month old sprouts.

AB Seedlings of Inga fagifolia (L.) Willd. and I. pezizifera Benth. were planted into the understory of a Costa Rican rain forest to test whether the proximity of large-leaved dwarf plams and cyclanths affects seedling growth and survival and if so, whether that effect is primarily due to above or belowground processes. In two sites, seedlings were planted either near palms (or palm-like Cyclanthaceae) or nearby in sites with no overarching vegetation under 1.5 m. Half of the seedlings in each treatment were trenched to a depth of 30 cm by cutting all roots 25 cm from the seedling. The proximity of palms or cyclanths significantly affected growth and survival of both species. However, most of this effect could be attributed to loss of stem length due to herbivore or pathogen damage rather than to differences in growth rates. There was no significant effect of trenching on seedling growth. Vegetation data from ten widely distributed sites in the forest showed that seedling density was inversely correlated with the abundance of understory palms and cyclanths. Our data suggest that understory vegetation, especially broad-leaved palms and palm-like cyclanths, acts as a filter affecting the distribution and abundance of establishing seedlings.

ID FEMALE FLOWERS; MIMICRY
AB In the predominantly monoecious genus Begonia, pollen is the only floral reward to pollinators.  To investigate the hypothesis that female Begonia flowers attract pollinators by mimicking male flowers, we studied floral display and pollinator behavior in a population of the protandrous perennial herb Begonia involucrata at Monteverde, Costa Rica.  The stigmas of the female flowers are bicornute and dark yellow, strongly resembling the anthers of male flowers.  The petaloid sepals of male flowers are somewhat larger than those of female flowers, but the number of open flowers does not differ between male- and female-phase inflorescences.  Both male and female inflorescences have a sweet odor.
   Trigona grandipennis, the most frequent flower visitor in the study population, consistently showed a strong preference for male-phase inflorescences; on average, individual male inflorescences received 3.4-9.6 (median 7.2) times as many visits as female inflorescences during five different observation periods.  Moreover, visits to male flowers lasted about ten times longer than visits to female flowers (mean 29.8 versus 2.6 seconds).  Although visits to female flowers were infrequent and brief, fruit set averaged 76 percent and seed set 57 percent.  A hand-pollination experiment indicated that seed set was pollen limited (1.4 times higher after supplemental pollination), but that fruit set was not.  Taken together, the striking similarity in male and female flower display, the selective pollinator behavior, and the relatively high levels of fruit and seed set support the hypothesis that the rewardless female flowers of B. involucrata mimic male flowers and are pollinated by deceit.

AB Of a total of 273 trees and 91 lianas species for a tropical rain forest at SE Veracruz, Mexico, 68 species (18.7%) are wind dispersed.  The anemochorous syndrome is represented better in lianas (42.9% of the species), while trees are predominately zoochorous (80.9%).  Specifically, data in relation to the phenology and frequency of diaspore type for 59 anemochorous species trees and lianas are presented.  At the community level, winged diaspores predominate (45 species, 76.3%); nonwinged species are much less common.  Of a total of 20 families, Bignoniaceae, Leguminosae, and Malpighiaceae are the families with the most species 14, 7, and 6 taxa respectively; all have winged diaspores.  For both life forms flowering is highly correlated with the late dry season.  Fruiting has two peaks, the first one late in the dry, hot season ("secas"), and the second one in the late wet season, when precipitation is high and temperature is low ("nortes").  The period of fruiting in trees and lianas is clearly separated in time.  Dispersal by trees is concentrated in "secas", while dispersal by lianas is more frequent during "nortes."  The fruiting in relation to diaspore type revealed two patterns.  Plumed diaspores were more abundant during "secas" independent of life form.  In contrast, species with winged diaspores had a bimodal distribution, one during "secas" and the other one during "nortes", the latter was due primarily to fruiting lianas.

TI STRATEGIES OF SEED DISPERSAL AND SEED PREDATION IN AMAZONIAN UNGULATES
SO BIOTROPICA
LA English
DT Article
ID FRUGIVORY
AB Amazonian ungulates, which include the red brocket deer, grey brocket deer, collared peccary, white-lipped peccary, and lowland tapir, consume large quantities of fruit and maximize nutritional gain by exploiting both pulp and seed.  Amazonian ungulates often disperse seeds over short distances by spitting them out during mastication.  The lowland tapir is the only ungulate that frequently disperses intact seeds through the digestive tract.  Brocket deer destroy most of the seeds they consume by digesting them with rumen microbes, while peccaries crack seeds using their resistant teeth, strong jaw muscles, and thick skull bones.  Defensive strategies of seeds include strength, chemical toxins, mast fruiting, fibrous lignin, and size variation.  Brocket deer and peccaries have pregastric fermentation that may detoxify some secondary compounds of seeds.  Small seeds occasionally pass intact through brocket deer and peccary guts.  However, strong palm seeds that avert many mammalian predators are often destroyed by ungulates.  The fibrous lignin that protects seeds of Jessenia bataua (Palmae) appears to be effective against ungulates which may explain its abundance in the study area.

DT Article
ID DISPERSAL; PALM
AB Predispersal seed predation is a widespread phenomenon in tropical forests.  However, few studies have quantified predator impact on seed crops during this critical stage of a plant's life cycle.  Here I report on a tight plant-animal interaction between brown capuchin monkeys (Cebus apella) and an emergent Lecythidaceae, Cariniana micrantha.  The very hard and thick pericarps of this species are morphological adaptations to protect their fatty and protein-rich seeds from predispersal predators.  However, brown capuchins are behaviorally adept at overcoming the seed protection mechanisms.  Based on direct observations and a sample of 7328 fruits from exhaustive counts of 10 focal C. micrantha trees, I estimate that 69.5% of the entire anemochorous, winged-seeded crop was destroyed because of direct predation.  Another 30.1 percent of the seed crop also became inviable, but in a different manner:  its single dispersal opportunity was disrupted because seeds remained trapped inside indehisced fruits which had been discarded to the ground by the monkeys.

AB The spatial distribution of herbivory, mines and galls was investigated within the crowns of the canopy tree Argyrodendron actinophyllum (Sterculiaceae) in a subtropical rain forest near Brisbane, Australia.  Apparent leaf damage amounted to 11 percent of leaf area removed, was significantly higher in sun than in shade leaves, was not significantly higher in the upper crown (> 25 m) than in the lower crown (15-25 m), and did not differ significantly among compass orientations.  Leaf biomass removed by herbivores was significantly higher in the upper crown and in sun samples.  Overall leaf damage, including leaflets entirely eaten and leaf-mining, ranged from 11 percent to 19 percent.  However, actual leaf consumption was mainly restricted to young leaves, and amounted to about 16 percent; this was more dependent on the location of isolated, abundant, and sunny patches of young foliage than on local differences in foliar nutrient characteristics, such as total nitrogen and water content.  Lepidopteran biomass and numbers were correlated with leaf damage in the samples.  Leaf-mining, averaging 31 mines per m2 of leaf area, was significantly higher in the lower canopy.  Gall densities approached three galls per m2 of leaf area.  Galled leaves were significantly larger and less heavily grazed.  Patterns of herbivory and leaf-mining observed are discussed in light of current information and theories relevant to insect-plant interactions in rain forests.

AB Although there is a growing body of literature concerning the physiology of lizard eggs, this information is largely derived from laboratory experiments, and there have been few measurements of the environmental conditions in natural lizard nests.  Unlike the nests of most lizards, the nests of some tropical iguanas are obvious and can be observed and experimentally manipulated.  Nests of the Cuban iguana Cyclura nubila were instrumented, and weekly measurements of soil temperature, soil water potential, and the concentrations of O2 and CO2 were recorded.  Nest temperatures were similar among nests and over a 24 hr cycle with temperatures around 31-32-degrees-C.  However, there was more variability in soil water potential among the nests, as they dried at different rates after a soaking rain near the beginning of incubation.  Although the gaseous environments of the nests were distinctly different from aboveground ambient conditions, the levels of O2 and CO2 were less extreme than in the nests of larger reptiles (sea turtles and crocodiles).  The CO2 concentrations were found to be related to nest depth and, to a lesser extent, clutch size.

AB Population characteristics of Boiga irregularis, a vertebrate predator introduced to Guam in the late 1940s or early 1950s, were studied.  Size class distributions reflected prey availability.  Large snakes (> 150 cm) were rare in forest habitat, where their preferred food (birds and mammals) were scarce or nonexistent, yet were commonly found in urban locations that supported a variety of vertebrate prey.  Males reached larger body sizes than females in both urban and nonurban habitats.  The sex ratio was about equal in the smaller size classes (< 120 cm), but became increasingly male-biased with increasing snout-vent length.  Snakes colonizing a previously snake-free area were significantly larger than individuals present in an area that had been colonized at least a decade earlier.  Night searches in forest habitat indicated snake densities in northern Guam were about 1.6 times greater than those in southern Guam.  A conservative density estimate of approximately 16 snakes/ha was obtained by grid trapping in an area where birds had been essentially eliminated by snakes.

AB We examine intercolonial interactions of the giant tropical ant, Paraponera clavata, at food resources and investigate the role of nestmate recognition in these interactions.  Workers near colony entrances express discrimination of nestmates from non-nestmates by attacking the latter.  Foragers engage in scramble competition with non-nestmates for large ephemeral food resources; agonism may occur secondarily in this context.  Nests of this species are significantly overdispersed, but discrete territorial boundaries are apparently not defended.  Agonistic interactions effectively exclude non-nestmates from the area near the nest; the nestmate recognition system serves primarily to protect the nest itself.

Regeneration is dominated by sprouts and seedlings of primary forest species, rather than secondary pioneers.  Little or no reduction in tree species richness has occurred, although bird and bat populations seem to have decreased considerably.  The "direct regeneration" observed after this large disturbance of primary forest, challenges previous views of both the pattern of secondary succession and the nature of primary rain forest.

ID FORESTS
AB Tree dispersion was evaluated in a Trachypogon savanna by measuring the distance from individual trees to their nearest conspecific neighbor.  The vegetation is a closed bush island savanna with coexistent isolated trees and small patches of semideciduous forest.  The isolated trees were in clumps similar to trees growing in savannas and tropical forests.  In our study, adults were less clumped compared to juveniles.  Environmental and biotic differences related to edaphic heterogeneity, life history, and reproductive strategy could account for the clumped pattern.  Different spatial patterns emerged for stems in groves.  Thus, uniform spatial distribution was evident in the individuals of the fire resistant species (Curatella americana, Byrsonima crassifolia and Bowdichia virgilioides) and a gap filling species (Casearia decandra).  Changes in the demographic components between different age groups provide evidence for density-dependent mortality.  A hypothesis mainly based on two scales of disturbance (human impact and gap formation) acting synergetically with a large scale factor (substrate patchiness) is put forward to explain the dynamics of tree invasion and the maintenance of the Trachypogon savanna.

Under natural conditions, the lower elevational limits of P. clava-herculis is primarily determined by competition with shrubs.  In areas near human habitation, the lower limit of P. clava-herculis and P. hamata is largely determined by constant burning.  Above the distribution of P. clava-herculis, bare ground or cushion and mat plants predominate.  On bare ground, solifluction, low temperatures, and moisture stress reduce the probability of Puya establishment.  In areas dominated by cushion and mat plants, either species of Puya is outcompeted or seedling safe sites are absent.
   Seedlings of P. clava-herculis showed a stronger than expected association with grass tussocks, indicating the importance of tussock edges as seedling safe sites.  The amount and type of ground cover, as well as the distance to and growth form of nearest neighbors, are important factors determining the local patchy distribution of P. clava-herculis.

AB Acid mats of Sphagnum erythrocalyx Hampe, growing on the dome of the tropical volcano La Soufriere, Guadeloupe, French West Indies, support associated populations of the nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterium Hapalosiphon flexuosus Borzi.  The acetylene reduction techniques was employed to measure nitrogenase activity.  The mean rate of C2H4 production in situ by entire plants with the associated cyanobacterium was 19.1 nmol C2H4.gdw-1.h-1 (range 0.20-101) with a nitrogenase activity for the uppermost green tips 4.5 times greater than that measured for the basal portions.  The highest rates for C2H2 reduction were recorded for plants damaged by high winds and for those plants established within vegetation zones recovering from severe damage resulting from the 1976-1977 phreatic eruption of this volcano.  The estimated rate of the annual contribution of nitrogen by nitrogen fixation is 4.02 kg N.ha-1.year-1.

AB We investigated variation in the nitrogen content of young leaves and the rate of leaf expansion in tropical shade tolerant species.  Both these factors can influence rates of herbivory:  low nitrogen content makes leaves less attractive to herbivores, while rapid expansion reduces the time that young leaves are vulnerable to herbivory.  Among the 13 study species, nitrogen in young leaves (at 5% of full expansion) ranged from 20 to 71 mg/g DW.  Most species had higher nitrogen in young leaves compared to mature leaves, but one species showed no change with age.  The ratio of nitrogen import relative to dry weight import was low (1-4%) and dropped during expansion.  The amount of nitrogen imported daily into the leaf peaked at 70-75 percent of full expansion, though species varied in the percent of final nitrogen that was imported prior to full expansion (67%-93%).  There was a significant positive correlation between nitrogen content of young leaves and the rate of leaf expansion.  We suggest that the age-specific patterns of nitrogen can best be understood as a trade-off between high palatability to herbivores and escape through rapid expansion.

AB The two Sumatran wild bananas, Musa acuminata subsp. halabanensis and M. salaccensis, belonging to the different sections Musa and Callimusa respectively, have contrasting flowering traits corresponding to their different pollination syndromes:  i.e., chiroptorophily and ornithophily, respectively.  The M. a. halabanensis flowers, on pendent inflorescences with dark purple bracts, produced jelly-like nectar of 22-25 percent sugar concentration primarily at night, and were pollinated by the nectarivorous pteropodid bats, Macroglossus sobrinus.  In contrast, the M. salaccensis flowers, on erect inflorescences with purplish pink bracts, produced dilute nectar of 18-21 percent sugar concentration primarily in the daytime, and were pollinated by the nectarivorous nectariniid birds, Arachnothera longirostris and Aethopyga siparaja.  The flowering span of each female flower was 24-40 hr, while that of the male flowers was < 12 hr.  Open flowers of both species contained significantly less outcrop of nectar than bagged flowers.  Fruit weight and seedset of open M. salaccensis flowers were significantly more than those of bagged flowers and were significantly less than those of hand-pollinated flowers.

AB The flowering of the dioecious seagrass Thalassodendron ciliatum (Cymodoceaceae) in Kenya is coincident with extremely low spring tides.  Staminate plants release their flowers underwater immediately before the low tide begins to return.  These float to the surface and there they expel the filamentous pollen.  The pollen form floating snowflake-like rafts (search vehicles) that collide on the water surface with the female stigmas.  Since pollination occurs on the water surface, T. ciliatum has a category 2 hydrophilous pollination system, strikingly similar to that of Amphibolis.  Seeds of the developing fruit germinate precociously and seedling development is viviparous.

ID GHANA COCOA FARMS; WEAVER ANT
AB Dominant arboreal ants are distributed in a mosaic-like fashion within tree-crop plantations throughout the New World and Old World tropics.  This paper reports on the distribution of arboreal ants within mango plantations, rain forests, and woodlands in the tropical northern part of Australia.  Only two genera of arboreal ants, Oecophylla and to a lesser extent Crematogaster, reach high densities on trees in the areas studied.  Both genera tend to occupy large blocks of canopy, but in the spaces between their colonies the canopy is either devoid of ants, occupied by arboreal-nesting species of low colony size, or visited by ground-nesting species.  The latter do not monopolise large, contiguous blocks of canopy.  The result is a partial ant mosaic of Oecophylla and Crematogaster territories with few, or no, ants on the surrounding canopy.
   The situation in tropical Australia is compared with published records from elsewhere in the world, and the reasons for the differences which exist are discussed.  Finally, the implications for pest management in Australian tropical tree crops are speculated upon.

AB Apocephalus paraponerae (Diptera:  Phoridae) is a parasitoid of injured workers of Paraponera clavata.  Both male and female flies are attracted to prospective hosts, the males to feed and the females to feed and oviposit.  Flies were attracted to extracts of crushed workers, the first definitive evidence for an olfactory mode of attraction in parasitic phorid flies.  Increasing the number of injured workers increased the number of parasitoids attracted.  A. paraponerae showed a strong attraction to P. clavata workers in comparison to other ant species, suggesting host specificity.  A continuous supply of injured ants is furnished by frequent inter-colony aggressive encounters in P. clavata, which can yield many maimed workers.  High local populations of A. paraponerae relative to other ant parasitoids is probably due to multiple parasitism of host workers and ready host availability.  We suggest that phorid parasites that use olfactory cues to locate hosts may play a role in the evolution and maintenance of pheromone diversity in ants.

AB The African fig tree Ficus sycomorus is host to two species of agaonid fig wasps, Ceratosolen arabicus and C. galili.  Our studies of C. galili in southern Africa confirm that it does not actively pollinate the figs of F. sycomorus, although some accidental pollination takes place.  The absence of pollination behavior in C. galili raises questions about the reasons why other agaonids pollinate the figs and thereby maintain the fig-fig wasp mutualism.  C. galili larvae did not suffer elevated mortality rates when developing in unpollinated flowers and the only potential "cost" of not pollinating that we detected was that adult female C. galili were smalled than those of C. arabicus that developed on the same tree.

Two upland plots, 1.0 and 0.5 ha in size, were selected and all trees greater-than-or-equal-to 10 cm dbh were measured and identified.  Trees greater-than-or-equal-to 2.5 cm and less-than-or-equal-to 9.9 cm dbh were sampled in 0.1 ha subplots.  Biomass was estimated using allometric equations.  Biomass levels are low, at 210 tons/ha, and tree canopy heights rarely exceed 30-35 m.  Few trees over 100 cm dbh were found.  Forests at Bajo Calima are among the most species-rich in the world, with over 250 tree species greater-than-or-equal-to 10 cm dbh per ha.  Palms are numerically abundant in the overstory, with Jessenia bataua being most common.  Free-climbing lianas are uncommon.  Only 11 species had more than 8 individuals greater-than-or-equal-to 10 cm dbh per ha.  Measures of soil nutrients indicate low fertility and possible aluminum toxicity.  The pluvial rain forests at Bajo Calima lend support to previous findings that high diversity is correlated with both high rainfall and low nutrient levels.

AB Phenology, floral biology, the reproductive system, and pollination of the macauba palm, Acrocomia aculeata were studied in Central Brazil.  The species is arborescent, single-stemmed, and reaches heights of up to 16 m.  Flowering occurs between August and December, peaking between October and November.  Fruit fall (harvest) is between June and March, with a peak in November.  Inflorescences are androgynous with marked protogyny.  The basic pollination syndrome is by beetles, with wind playing a secondary role.  The principal pollinators are Andranthobius sp. (Curculionidae), Mystrops cf mexicana (Nitidulidae) and Cyclocephala forsteri (Scarabaeidae).  Cross-pollination between different individuals (xenogamy) accounts for most of the reproductive system.  However, the species is self-compatible, with geitonogamy accounting for a significant percentage of fruit set.  The combination of two pollination strategies (wind and insects) with a flexible reproductive system (cross- and self-pollination) suggests that A. aculeata' can be highly successful in the colonization of new areas, as is evidenced by the ample distribution of species in the Neotropics.

AB Observations and experiments show that Erioscelis emarginata (Dynastinae, Scarabaeidae), the sole pollinator of Philodendron selloum (Araceae), is guided at dusk to the inflorescences in their female stage by a combination of olfactory and visual stimuli.  At close range, visual stimuli are induced by olfactory stimuli and the beetles orient themselves by the light inner side of the spathe.  Light models are more attractive than dark ones.  Nonfragrant spathes or spathe models, which are put closest to the odor sources, are most visited.  Odoriferous inflorescences in the female stage emit stimuli for Erioscelis that are present to remain, while in male-stage inflorescences such stimuli are absent.  Light inhibits beetles from leaving male-stage inflorescences.

   TROPICAL TREES; FOREST; DYNAMICS; SIZE; COMPETITION; CONSUMPTION
AB The foraging behavior of fruit-eating birds influences the reproductive success of the plants whose seeds they disperse.  One important aspect of their behavior is the amount of time they spend in fruiting plants.  Qualitative models based on a bird's predation risk, diet, and breeding system have been proposed by Howe (1979) and Pratt and Stiles (1983) to explain how much time birds spend in fruiting trees.  These models predict that relatively large body size and cryptic plumage should make birds less vulnerable to predation and enable them to spend longer time in fruiting trees.  Additionally, they predict that birds that specialize on a narrow fruit diet or have monogamous breeding systems should also spend more time in fruiting plants because they do not have to leave plants to diversify their diet or attend leks or display perches.
   This study presents data on the behavior of four bird species which were responsible for more than 94 percent of all feeding visits to eight bird-dispersed tree species in the family Lauraceae in the lower montane forests of northwestern Costa Rica.  Despite prominent differences in size, coloration, diet, method of foraging for fruits, and breeding system, the birds spent about the same amount of time per foraging visit (median visit lengths = 2.9-4.7 min) and ate about the same number of fruits (1-3) per visit.  Differences between sexes within bird species were slight or nonexistent.  Single factors such as crypsis, diet, or breeding system were ineffective in predicting how long birds spent in fruiting plants.
   An analysis of fruit processing times and caloric value in relation to birds' metabolic rates indicates that fruits may not be the "free lunch" they are often reputed to be.  Birds may not be able to meet their energetic demands on a pure diet of the large, lipid-rich fruits of the Lauraceae because gut space is limited and it takes so long to process individual fruits.

AB I studied the natural history of a short-horned tropical forest grasshopper, Microtylopteryx hebardi Rehn (Orthoptera:  Acrididae:  Ommatolampinae) at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica.  M. hebardi is flightless as an adult, and hence has low dispersal capabilities, yet inhabits light gaps and other temporary habitats.  Numbers of adult M. hebardi were relatively constant between gaps and during the seven month study period, and all life stages were found year-round.  Host plant range of M. hebardi included 52 species in 16 monocot and dicot families, but the majority of feeding records and all oviposition records occurred in four related monocotyledonous families.

TI NOCTURNAL PERCHING OF SCARABAEINE DUNG BEETLES (COLEOPTERA,

SO BIOTROPICA
LA English
DT Article
AB Wongabel, a northeastern Queensland tropical, wet, evergreen forest, contains 22 species of Scarabaeinae dung beetles. Five of these species were observed to perch commonly on leaves at night. Length of the beetle and the height of its perch were recorded for each of 561 specimens. Unlike the New World tropical dung beetle perchers, no clear evidence was found that small species perched closer to the ground than larger species. The evidence gathered, at least for the four most common perchers, supports the hypothesis that perching is one type of foraging strategy. The similarities and differences between the Australian and New World perchers are discussed.

AB The skin secretions of two neotropical salamanders, Bolitoglossa rostrata and B. subpalmata, adversely affect snakes of the genus Thamnophis, which commonly prey on amphibians.  The secretion causes the snake to pause during ingestion, paralyzes the mouth, and may render the snake incapable of moving or responding to external stimuli.  Snakes often died after attempting to eat the toxic B. rostrata.

AB Using radiotelemetry, we studied the foraging behavior of 12 Megaderma lyra from 9 March to 5 April 1988 in South India.  Tagged bats used individual but nonexclusive areas of ca 0.1 km2 located from < 500 m to 4 km from their day roost and 41 percent of the foraging activity of tagged individuals occurred less-than-or-equal-to 500 m from the roost.  They spent the night away from the day roost alternating between flights of < 1 min to 45 min and perching bouts of < 1 min to 274 min.  Females flew for up to 174 min nightly and males up to 306 min.  Most flights (69.7% for males and 72.5% for females) recorded by telemetry lasted > 1 min and fourteen of 16 prey captures (85%) that we observed visually, involved search flights of 10-200 m.  Prey taken included insects (Orthoptera, Coleoptera), and small vertebrates (Amphibia, Reptilia).  From these data we infer that M. lyra are flexible in their foraging strategies and catch prey from the ground.

AB The Ituri Forest of Eastern Zaire contains the richest recorded assemblage of anthropoid primates in the world (13 sympatric species), the behavior and ecology of which have not previously been studied.  This study reports the result of line transect censuses at seven locations in the northern and central Ituri, and presents analyses of primate habitat use according to forest type, treefall gaps, tree species in which primates were observed, and height of primates in the vegetation.  Estimated total anthropoid primate density is 112 ind/km2, corresponding to a biomass of 715 kg/km2.  Three common species of frugivorous/insectivorous Cercopithecus monkeys (C. ascanius, C. mitis, C. pogonius) showed pronounced habitat preferences for secondary forest, as did one folivore, Colobus guereza.  The two more abundant colobine monkeys (Colobus angolensis and C. badius) were seen mainly in mature "mixed" forest.  Very few primates of any species were observed in areas of "mbau" forest, a forest type dominated by the single tree species Gilbertiodendron dewevrei.  The smallest Cercopithecus monkey, C. ascanius, was frequently observed in and around treefall gaps, and may be a "gap-specialist" in this species-rich primate community.  The abundance of common Cercopithecus monkeys in secondary forest may be a response to continuous fruiting of pioneer tree species which constitute a dependable but low-quality resource during the seasonal hiatus of fruit availability in primary forest.

AB Information on decomposition and nitrogen release patterns of tropical legumes is scarce despite the important role of legumes in agroforestry systems.  Decomposition patterns of the leaves of three tropical legumes Inga edulis Mart., Cajanus cajan (1.) Millsp., and Erythrina sp. were determined by a litterbag study in an alley cropping experiment conducted in the Peruvian Amazon.  The leaflets of the three species had similar nitrogen concentrations but different lignin and soluble polyphenolic concentrations.  Inga and Cajanus decomposed at similar rates (k = 0.91 and 1.72 yr-1, respectively) and had similar polyphenolic concentrations but differed in lignin.  Erythrina had the lowest concentration of polyphenolics and decomposed the fastest (k = 3.45 yr-1).  Polyphenolics appeared to influence rates of decomposition more than percent nitrogen or percent lignin.  It is proposed that the polyphenolics bind to N in the leaves forming compounds resistant to decomposition.  These compounds may be precursors to stable forms of nitrogen in soil organic matter.  Rates of nutrient loss followed the general trend potassium > phosphorus, nitrogen, and magnesium > calcium.  It is apparent from this study that not all leguminous leaves decompose and release nitrogen quickly, despite high nitrogen concentrations in the leaves.  Nitrogen release by legumes with high polyphenolic concentrations will be slower than that by legumes with low polyphenolic concentrations and has important implications to nitrogen cycling and the selection of legumes for agroforestry systems.

AB Soil respiration was studied in the elfin cloud forest and in the dry deciduous forest of Serrania de Macuira, Guajira Peninsula, Colombia.  At the end of the 1985 rainy season, soil respiration was significantly higher (P < 0.001) in the cloud forest (mean daily CO2 evolution = 511 mg CO2 m-2 hr-1) than in the dry deciduous forest (251 mg CO2 m-2 hr-1).  In both forests, carbon dioxide evolution was higher during the night than during the day.  The differences between day and night values in the cloud forest were attributed to the daily variation in fog interception.  Day and night values differed more in the cloud forest than in the deciduous forest.  High soil respiration rates in the cloud forest as compared to the deciduous forest were attributed to the relatively high temperature (24-degrees-C), and water content of the soils (31%), and to the abundant earthworms (64 earthworms m-2).

AB We examined position effects on components of fruit mass within infructescences of Phytolacca rivinoides to determine whether distal portions of an infructescence provide fewer resources for developing fruits than basal portions, resulting in a decrease in fruit or seed mass, or seed number per fruit towards the distal end of a raceme.  We also sought evidence for yield compensation due to resource limitation by measuring the relationships between reproductive components among individual fruits and among infructescence means.  The results of three natural experiments did not show that distal portions of a raceme are consistently at a disadvantage with regard to maternal resources; different fruit characteristics showed different patterns.  In general, there were significant declines in total fruit mass and pulp mass from the basal to the distal portions of an infructescence.  In contrast, total seed mass, mean individual seed mass, and seed number per fruit showed no significant decline; in some cases these parameters increased distally.  In two natural experiments, we controlled for developmental effects on fruit, pulp and seed mass by comparing only fully ripened fruits located at relatively basal and distal positions.  The results of these two experiments differed markedly.  In one experiment, total seed mass per fruit and mean individual seed mass per fruit increased significantly towards the distal end of the sampled infructescences, while seed number per fruit remained unchanged.  In the other experiment, total seed mass and mean individual seed mass per fruit remained constant, while seed number per fruit increased significantly towards distal positions of the infructescences.
   The relationship between seed mass and seed number per fruit was explored in three ways, but none revealed evidence for maternal resource limitation leading to an inverse relationship (or trade-off) between mass and number.  First, a regression of mean seed mass on seed number per fruit indicated that the two traits are independent of each other (N = a total of 500 fruits on 25 infructescences).  Second, regressions of mean individual seed mass on seed number among fruits within each of 25 infructescences showed no evidence that seed mass was negatively associated with seed number; in two infructescences, mean individual seed mass and seed number per fruit were positively associated.  Finally, among infructescences, mean individual seed mass was independent of mean seed number per fruit.  Infructescence length was positively correlated with fruit number but independent of all other measured parameters, indicating that infructescences bearing many fruits did not produce fewer or smaller seeds than those with few fruits.  The most surprising outcomes of this study are that we detected no strong position effects on, or inverse relationships between, seed mass and number that indicate that the availability of resources determines seed mass or number per fruit, though this is a phenomenon seen widely within temperate zone species.

AB Fifty-six species of eyeless and reduced-eyed (obligately cryptozoic) macroscopic arthropods are now known from the Galapagos Islands. These occupy cave, ground water, and soil-litter habitats. Sixteen soil-inhabiting species have become established after their probable inadvertent introduction by humans. The number and diversity of the remaining 40 native and endemic species are remarkable because of the geologic youth (about three million years maximum) and oceanic isolation of the islands. Soil habitats contain ten species whose ancestors naturally arrived on the islands in an already eyeless condition, demonstrating that such taxa have greater powers of overwater dispersal than is generally thought. Caves and soils are inhabited by ten eyeless or reduced-eyed species which have related fully-eyed epigean (sister?) species, usually on the same island, indicating relatively recent (possibly parapatric) adaptive radiation into subterranean environments. Another 20 species have no close Galapagos relatives, and 15 of these are probably relicts of lineages which became extinct in epigean terrestrial habitats, probably because of repeated periods of intense aridity during the Pleistocene. Similar evolutionary patterns exist in the eyeless arthropods of the Hawaiian and Canary archipelagos, indicating that there are common processes in the origins of such eyeless tropical oceanic island faunas.

AB The soils of a secondary regrowth forest plot and an adjoining cassava plot in southwest Nigeria were investigated over an annual cycle to show the seasonal variations in their mite (Acarina) populations.  Data on rainfall, soil moisture content, and soil temperature were simultaneously collected.  Microenvironmental differences in the two plots were reported to have influenced the densities, age structure, and fluctation patterns of the mite populations.  Like most other arthropods, mostly insects and spiders studied in other tropical environments, the soil mites showed within and between seasonal changes in abundance at both the forest and cassava plots.  Two patterns of seasonal fluctuations characterized by a single maximum population density on the one hand and multiple peak populations on the other hand were shown by the mite groups in the forest and cassava plots.  Unlike most mite groups whose patterns of fluctuations were similar in the forest and cassava plots, Haplozetes sp., Carabodes sp., Oppia sp., Tectocepheus sp., and Parasitidae were reported to have reacted to the difference in environmental attributes between the forest and the cassava plots by exhibiting different fluctuation patterns between the two plots.  The population build-up potential of mites in the cassava plot, especially Haplozetes sp., is discussed.

AB We examined the behavior patterns and the extent of aggression exhibited during intraspecific interactions in Abronia vasconcelosii, a tropical, arboreal lizard from Gautemala.  Interactions between these lizards in three types of paired trials (male-male, female-female, male-female) were videotaped in the laboratory.  Nine behavior patterns were exhibited by A. vasconcelosii in the trials.  Neither body size nor residency status influenced the frequency of behavior patterns.  Encounters between males were longest in duration, involved the most interactions, and resulted in the most extensive aggression in the form of biting.  Males bit males more often then females bit females and the location of the bites differed.  Bite location was nonrandom in both cases with the majority of bites in male-male encounters directed at the trial and more evenly distributed among the head, trunk, and tail in female-female encounters.

AB Three males and one female leopard cat were radio-collared and followed for periods of 1-13 months in Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary, Thailand.  The cats had overall home ranges from 1.5-7.5 km2 with core areas of 0.7-2 km2.  A female leopard cat utilized an area of 6.6 km2 over 13 months while a male leopard cat, who shifted ranges, used 7.5 km2 over 3.5 months.  Cats followed for longer periods of time generally showed larger overall ranges.  The cats were active 50 percent of the time and displayed arrhythmic activity patterns.  Leopard cats followed for at least several months showed seasonal variation in movement and ranging patterns.  Fourteen prey items were identified in the feces of leopard cats, with small mammals, particularly Maxomys surifer, dominating the prey.  Leopard cats preferred resting and moving on the ground, utilizing dry decidous dipterocarp forest proportionally less than dry evergreen or mixed decidous forest.  Annual fires that help maintain the dry decidous dipterocarp forest in the study area may affect both short and long term survival of leopard cats.

AB The reproductive patterns of three didelphid marsupial species (Caluromys philander, Didelphis marsupialis and Philander opossum) were studied in secondary and mature forest in French Guiana in relation to food supply and seasonal variation.  Both forests exhibited a period of low fruit availability which was longer and more acute in the mature forest.  Nevertheless, survival rate of pouch young was higher for C. philander and P. opossum in the mature forest.  It was correlated with high nectar availability during the season of fruit scarcity, and with lower population density compared to the secondary forest site.  Conversely, D.  marsupialis had a more seasonal breeding pattern, with low mortality of pouch young on both sites, and thus appeared less directly dependent on environmental conditions.
   Annual variations in body weight were compared for the three species on both study areas.  Influence of parturition dates, age and body weight of the female upon litter size and pouch young survival is discussed.

AB Feral goats (Capra bircus) on the tropical atoll of Aldabra, Republic of Seychelles, were observed drinking seawater at the end of extended dry periods when no fresh water was available.  These observations represent the first documentation of voluntary consumption of seawater by an ungulate under natural field conditions.  The kidneys of the goats showed no unusual gross morphology.  In addition to consuming seawater, the goats produced relatively dry feces and fed on plants with relatively high water content.
