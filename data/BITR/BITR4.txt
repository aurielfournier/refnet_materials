AB All confirmed records of entomophilic pollination in cycads are for species in the Zamiaceae. This paper presents details of entomophily in both species of Bowenia in the Stangeriaceae. Seed set in female cones from which wind and water-borne pollen, but not insects, was excluded, indicates that pollination is obligately entomophilous. The pollination vectors are Miltotranes weevils and the relationships are species-specific and possibly coevolutionary.

DE epiphyte; Mystacidium venosum; nectar reabsorption; Orchidaceae
ID POLLINATION; FLOWERS
AB We present evidence that pollination triggers nectar reabsorption in flowers of the epiphytic orchid Mystacidium venosum. The amount of sugar in nectar of M. venosum decreased significantly by more than 50 percent within 72 hours of pollination. Hand-pollinated flowers from which nectar was previously removed set significantly smaller fruits with a lower percentage of viable seeds than hand-pollinated flowers containing nectar, suggesting that resources reclaimed by nectar resorption are allocated to fruit production.

AB Aerodynamic theory predicts that migrant fliers should reduce their speed of flight as endogenous energy reserves are gradually consumed. This prediction was tested for Urania fulgens (Walker) moths migrating through central Panama in 1987 and again in 1998. Direct airspeed measurements together with chloroform: methanol extractions of abdominal lipids were used to determine that, contrary to theoretical predictions, the speed of flight among individuals was independent of both body mass and abdominal lipid mass.

Pit establishment was more affected by soil improvement than by the exclusion of ants, suggesting that soil condition is the main factor that affect antlions' density. The low density of this ant-predator in ant-acacia clearings may be considered as an indirect advantage of the ant's pruning behavior.

Seeds from three of six plant species collected from scats germinated faster than seeds not passing through bears; germination percentage was not higher in any of the six species. These results suggest that the sloth bear may play an important role in the population dynamics of fleshy-fruited species of the region.

AB Species composition shifts in mangrove forests may alter organic matter dynamics. The purpose of this study was to predict the effect of species replacements among mangrove trees on organic matter dynamics in a mangrove forest on the island of Kosrae. Federated States of Micronesia. We were particularly interested in elements of the carbon cycle that affect peat accumulation rates, organic matter exports to the estuary and coral reef systems, and soil microbiology. We compared organic matter production and decomposition rates among three mangrove species that commonly grow in similar hydrogeomorphic settings: Rhizophora apiculata BL, which is selectively harvested; Bruguiera gymnorrhiza, which may gradually replace Rhizophora; and Sonneratia alba, which is producing few mature fruits. Sonneratia had significantly higher rates of root production (estimated with ingrowth chambers) than Bruguiera or Rhizophora. Sonneratia foliage had significantly faster decomposition rates and significantly lower lignin:nitrogen ratios than Bruguiera foliage. Live root mass was positively correlated with ingrowth and soil carbon, although soil carbon and ingrowth were not significantly correlated with each other. Humic acid concentrations were significantly higher in Sonneratia rhizospheres than in either Bruguiera or Rhizophora rhizospheres and were positively correlated with root ingrowth. The species changes taking place on Kosrae are likely to result in lower rates of root production and foliage decomposition, and more refractory carbon pools in soil.

AB This study examined the role of shading and cloud combing of moisture by scattered trees of the emergent conifer Araucaria laubenfelsii (Corbass.) in montane shrubland-maquis at Mont Do, New Caledonia, in facilitating the succession from shrubland to rain forest. Water collection experiments showed that these trees combed significant amounts of water from low clouds on days when no rainfall was recorded and deposited this moisture on the ground beneath the tree canopy. Analysis of photosystem II function in A. laubenfelsii and five other plant species using fluorometry revealed much lower photosystem stress in plants beneath scattered A. laubenfielsii than for individuals exposed to full sunlight in the open maquis. Transition matrix analyses of vegetation change based on "the most likely recruit to succeed" indicated that the transition from maquis to forest was markedly faster when emergent trees of A. laubenfelsii acted as nuclei for forest species invasion of the maquis. On the basis of these lines of evidence, it is argued that increased moisture and shading supplied to the area directly below the crown of isolated A. laubenfelsii trees in the maquis facilitates the establishment of both conifer seedlings and other rain forest tree and shrub species. In the absence of fire, rain forest can reestablish through spread in two ways: first, by expansion from remnant patches, and second, from coalescence of small rain forest patches formed around individual trees of A. laubenfelsii.

AB Epiphytes generally occupy arboreal perches, which are inherently unstable environments due to periodic windstorms, branch falls, and treefalls, During high wind events, arboreal bromeliads are often knocked from the canopy and deposited on the forest floor. In this study, we used a common epiphytic tank bromeliad, Guzmania berteroniana (R. & S.) Mez, to determine if fallen bromeliads can survive, grow, and reproduce on the forest floor and evaluate the potential impact of adult dispersal on plant and soil nutrient pools. Brometiads were transplanted to and from tree stems and the forest floor and monitored intensively for six months; survival, growth, and impacts on ecosystem nutrient pools were followed on a subset of plants for 16 months. Six months after transplanting, bromeliad mortality was low (3%), and 19 percent of study individuals had flowered and produced new juvenile shoots. Mortality, on the subset of plants followed for 16 months was 14-30 percent. Although survival rates were relatively high in all habitats, bromeliads transplanted to trees grew significantly more root length ((x) over bar +/- SE: 189 +/- 43 cm) than those moved to the forest floor (53 +/- 15 cm) and experienced lower rates of leaf area loss. All transplanted bromeliads rapidly altered the substrate they occupied. Individuals transplanted to and among trees rapidly decreased base cation concentrations but significantly increased P concentrations of their underlying substrate. On the ground, bromeliads increased C, N, and P concentrations within nine months of placement. Our results suggest that in this montane tropical forest, bromeliads respond rapidly to displacement, locally modify, their substrates, and can access the resources needed for survival regardless of habitat.

AB Hylocereus undatus, which is native to tropical forests experiencing moderate temperatures, would not be expected to tolerate the extremely high temperatures that can be tolerated by cacti native to deserts. Nevertheless, total daily net CO2 uptake by this hemiepiphytic cactus, which is widely cultivated for its fruits, was optimal at day/night air temperatures of 30/20degreesC, temperatures that are higher than those optimal for daily net CO2 uptake by cacti native to and and semiarid areas. Exposure to 35/25degreesC for 30 weeks led to lower net CO2 uptake than at 10 weeks; exposure to 40/30degreesC led to considerable necrosis visible on the stems at 6 weeks and nearly complete browning of the stems by 19 weeks. Dry mass gain over 31 weeks was greatest for plants at 30/20degreesC, with root growth being especially noteworthy and root dry mass gain representing an increasing percentage of plant dry mass gain as day/night air temperatures were increased. Viability of chlorenchyma cells, assayed by the uptake of the vital stain neutral red into the central vacuoles, was decreased 50 percent by a one-hour treatment at 55degreesC compared with an average of 64degreesC for 18 species of cacti native to deserts. The lower high-temperature tolerance for H. undatus reflected its low high-temperature acclimation of only 1.4degreesC as growth temperatures were raised by 10degreesC compared with an average acclimation of 5.3degreesC for the other 18 species of cacti. Thus, this tropical hemiepiphytic cactus is not adapted to day/night air temperatures above ca 40/30degreesC, although its net CO2 uptake is optimal at the relatively high day/night air temperatures of 30/20degreesC.

AB Studies were conducted at the La Selva Biological Station in Costa R ca and in a greenhouse in California to determine the factors accounting for the nonrandom distribution of the riparian fig tree Ficus insipida Willd. along streams in the La Selva Biological Reserve and adjacent deforested lands. We also evaluated the potential seed dispersers of this tree relative to the role of the fruit-eating fish Brycon guatemalensis that previously was proposed to be an important disperser of F insipida seeds in this system. At La Selva, we recorded the fig-foraging activities of vertebrates at fruiting F insipida trees, surveyed for the presence or absence of F insipida along streams of different sizes, and determined the face of fig seedlings transplanted in different riparian habitats. In the greenhouse, we measured seed germination and seedling survival and growth under different light and soil pH conditions mimicking natural conditions. The findings provided evidence that (1) the tree occurs along the larger streams running through forest habitat and only along smaller streams with relatively high light availability; (2) bats (Artibeus spp.) and fish are the major dispersers of F insipida seeds; (3) the seedlings are subject to mortality not only from low light conditions but also from treefalls, frequent flooding, and bank erosion; and (4) high light levels and near neutral soil pH result in relatively better seed germination, faster growth, and higher survival rates of seedlings. Overall, our results suggest that this fig tree is dispersed mainly by bats and fish and is more establishment-limited than disperser-limited in its local distribution in the La Selva rain forest habitat.

AB Fruit abundance in tropical forests thus far has been studied in relation to consumer populations. Area-based surveys chat focus on the quantity and quality of the standing fruit crop of an entire plant community, however, are lacking. This paper presents the results of a four-month study on the seasonality and vertical distribution of the standing fruit crop within a tropical forest during the dry season in southern Venezuela. Fruit numbers ranged from 262,000 to 424,000 fruits/ha. The standing crop was between 39 and 92 kg/ha, Yielding 67,000 to 126,000 kJ. Fruits were not evenly distributed in different forest layers. They were most abundant in the canopy above 16 m and scarce between 4 and 12 in above the ground, Despite a scarcity of fruits in the mid-strata, the caloric value of the total fruit supply peaked within a narrow layer of subcanopy at 12 to 16 in above ground due to a high amount of energy per fruit. Palms fruited mostly in this layer, their fruits contributing 59 percent of the energy supplied by all fruits. Above 12 in, we found a broader range of fruit sizes than in the forest below 12 in. Small-sized fruits were distributed in the understory and in the canopy but were nearly absent from the mid-story. Corresponding to the abundance of small-sized fruits in the canopy, small frugivorous species, such as members of the Thraupidae, limited their foraging to the canopy strata whereas larger avian frugivores foraged mainly in the mid-story.

AB The role of bats and sunbirds in the pollination ecology of Musa itinerans Cheesman (Musaceae) was studied in the tropical seasonal rain forests of Xishuangbanna, southern Yunnan, China, It was found that both long-tongued fruit bats (Macroglossus sobrinus) and sunbirds (Arachnothera longirostris) were effective pollinators of M. itinerans. Nectar production had two peaks, one during the day and one during night (0800-1200 h and 2000-2400 h), which allowed the two different foragers to visit at specific times, The visitation patterns of the two foragers coincided with both flowering time and nectar production. By measuring the differences in fruit weight and seed production among different bagging experiments, we found that birds and bats were equally effective as pollinators of this species.

AB The effectiveness of a seed disperser depends on the quantity and quality of dispersal. The quality of dispersal depends in large part on factors that affect the post-dispersal fate of seeds, and yet this aspect of dispersal quality is rarely assessed. In the particular case of seed dispersal through endozoochory the defecation pattern produced has the potential of affecting the fate of dispersed seeds and consequently, dispersal quality and effectiveness. In this study, I assessed the effects of dung presence and dung/seed densities on seed predation by rodents and seconclary dispersal by dung beetles. In particular, I compared seed fates in clumped defecation patterns, as those produced by howler monkeys, with seed faces in scattered defecation patterns, as those produced by other frugivores. I also determined the prevalence of red howler monkeys (Alouatta seniculus) as seed dispersers at the plant community level in Central Amazonia by determining the number of species they dispersed in a 25-month period. I found chat dung presence and a-mount affected rodent and dung beetle behavior. Seed predation rates were higher when dung was present, and when it was in higher densities. The same number of seeds was buried by dung beetles, in clumped versus scattered defecation patterns, but more seeds were buried when they were inside large dung-piles versus small piles. Seed density had no effect on rodent or dung beetle behavior. Results indicate that caution should be taken when categorizing an animal as a high or low quality seed disperser before carefully examining the factors that affect the fate of dispersed seeds. Red howler monkeys dispersed the seeds of 137 species during the study period, which is the highest yet reported number for an Alouatta species, and should thus be considered highly prevalent seed dispersers at the plant community level in Central Amazonian terra firme rain forests.

AB In tropical areas worldwide, more than 1000 terrestrial species of invertebrates are used as food. For populations of Amazonian areas, different species of insects and other invertebrates serve as nourishing food sources. Here, we document the composition and nutritional quality of some invertebrates consumed in Venezuelan Amazonia, including termites (Isoptera) and earthworms (Glossoscolecidae) eaten by the Ye'Kuana (Makiritare) and caterpillars (Lepidoptera) and grubs (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) consumed by the Yanomamo. Consumption of 100 g of any of these invertebrates contributed 1.2-9.4 percent of the daily fat requirement and 26-144 percent of the protein daily requirement for an adult male. The sample of caterpillars regularly eaten by these peoples was rich in beta carotene (provitamin A), and a 100 g ingestion guaranteed 323 percent of the recommended daily intake of vitamin A. The greatest amount of alpha tocopherol was provided by the consumption of the smoked earthworms (36.7%). Earthworms and termites contained high levels of sterols, mainly cholesterol. The consumption of these animals by tropical human populations represents not only an important traditional habit but also, considering their nutritional composition, a substantial contribution to the human diet.

AB Across a wide range of temperatures established in the laboratory, we tape-recorded the advertisement calls of 76 freshly caught Hyla labialis males from three elevationally separated populations in the Eastern Andes of Colombia. Each male was tested once at a single temperature and returned to his capture site after measurement of his snout-vent length. We measured and averaged three characteristics of five to ten successive calls for each individual; number of pulses per call, pulse repetition rate, and call duration. We found that calling activity occurred within temperature ranges that overlapped among frogs from different elevations, but widened and shifted downward with increasing altitude of origin. Males from all sites called at temperatures higher, but nor lower, than those naturally occurring during their nightly activity period. No decline in vocal performance was apparent when frogs extended their calling activity into the range of high temperatures selected for basking. Both snout-vent length and temperature affected pulse repetition rate and call duration, while the number of pulses per call was temperature-independent. Compared to the smaller males from lower elevations, the larger, high-mountain males had calls with significantly more pulses, a lower pulse repetition rate, and longer duration. Within each population, rising temperatures caused pulse repetition rate to increase and call duration to decrease significantly, whereas the number of pulses per call remained unchanged. Pulse repetition rate of highland males was the factor least affected by temperature, and it was less sensitive to night temperatures than to day temperatures. This, together with their capacity to call at low temperatures, suggests that highland frog calls are cold adapted.

AB This study examined the effects of (1) time elapsed after logging and (2) logging intensity on the total, juvenile, and adult densities, and on reproduction of Calathea altissima and Ischnosiphon arouma (Marantaceae), two monocot herb species in the understory of Central Amazonian forests. Logging was carried out experimentally at various intensities in eight plots (4 ha each) during 1987 and three plots in 1993. Five plots were left as experimental controls. In 1998, total and adult densities of the two species were greater in the plots logged I I years before than in controls. For I. arouma, total and adult densities were also higher in the plots logged 5 years before; however, juvenile densities were less affected. The intensity of togging influenced adult density of both species but not total or juvenile densities. Densities of reproductive individuals of both species were higher in the logged areas and increased with logging intensity. The effects of time after logging and logging intensity on reproduction were indirect due to the greater number of adult plants in those areas. The observed effects were probably mediated by changes in canopy cover in logged areas. Greater light intensities in logging gaps, roads, and their margins may lead to increased reproduction, recruitment, growth, and survival, which in turn can lead to increased plant density. These results indicate that logging has long-term effects on understory plant populations.

AB Seeds from tropical fruiting trees ingested and defecated on the soil surface by primary dispersers (such as primates) are vulnerable to destruction from rodents, insects, and fungi. Burial by dung beetles as an incidental result of their feeding and nesting activities often provides these seeds with refugia from attack. To examine the effect of habitat disturbance on the dung beetle communities involved in this process, I surveyed dung beetles at three sites in the Amazon basin, in the states of Para, Amazonas, and Rondonia, Brazil Through principal component analysis on measurements of size and behavioral characters of beetles, I determined the relative quality of beetle species as seed dispersers (dispersal defined as horizontal or vertical movement of seeds) and ranked them into seed dispersal guilds, I used correspondence analysis to examine in what habitats (primary forest or varying degrees of disturbed habitat) these guilds were abundant. Most guilds decreased with increasing habitat disturbance, but one guild made up of large nocturnal burrowers (primarily Dichotomius) became more abundant with increasing disturbance (up to the level of highest disturbance surveyed), at which point all dung beetle species became scarce. Clear-cuts had lower species richness, lower abundance, and lower biomass than forested areas. These results imply char clear-cutting is detrimental to all seed dispersal dynamics in tropical rain forests, but that some levels of disturbance allow enough disperser activity to preserve this ecosystem function.

AB Small mammal trapping showed that a minimum of 12 species live in and around Katavi National Park in western Tanzania. Species richness and abundance were greater outside the park than inside, extending results of an earlier study. Species richness and abundance were not significantly associated with vegetation cover or plant biomass but were negatively correlated with seed diversity, seed biomass, and possibly small carnivore abundance. Unfortunately, small mammal diets are unknown in this ecosystem and it can be argued that carnivores are unlikely to reduce species diversity, casting doubt on the importance of these variables. While the factors causing small mammals to fare poorly in this protected area are not yet understood, reduced food availability remains the best candidate.

AB We investigated the variation of stable (delta(13)C) soil carbon isotopes in relation to depth in seven of the most important savanna are-as to adjacent contiguous forests in the Amazon region. The delta(13)C of bulk organic matter in all profiles from forested sites increased with sod depth. In forest profiles from Amapa, Alter do Chao, and Roraima, the enrichment was less than 3.5parts per thousand between deeper soil and surface layers, suggesting that C-3 plants have remained the dominant vegetation cover. On the other hand, in forest soil profiles from Humaita and Carolina sites, the delta(13)C enrichment was greater than 3.5parts per thousand indicating the influence of past C-4 vegetation or a mixture Of C-3/C-4 vegetation (woody savanna). The surface delta(13)C values in the savanna profiles were 5-13parts per thousand greater than the comparable Forest profiles, indicating the influence of C-4 vegetation. Two kinds of isotopic distribution were observed in deeper layers. The savanna profiles at Alter do Chao, Chapada dos Parecis, and Redencao had relatively constant delta(13)C values throughout the profile, suggesting minor past changes in the vegetation composition, In profiles at Amapa, Roraima, Humaita, and Carolina, delta(13)C values decreased with depth from the surface and converged with comparable forest values, suggesting more woody savanna in the past than exists currently.

AB Mineral soils from a chronosequence of landslide scars ranging in age from I to more than 55 years in a subtropical montane rain forest of eastern Puerto Rico were used to determine the rate at which labile P capital recovers during primary succession. Nine organic and inorganic soil P fractions were measured using the Hedley sequential extraction procedure. Deep soil cores (9 m) from a nearby site were also analyzed to determine the distribution of P fractions below the solum. Litterfall P was measured for two years in the landslide scars to estimate allochthonous litter P inputs, and published precipitation data were used to estimate annual atmospheric inputs of P to the recovering forests. In the upper solum (0-10 cm), organic matter increased with landslide age, as did resin-Pi, labile P (defined here as resin-Pi + HCO3-Pi + HCO3-Po) and total organic P. Occluded P decreased with increasing landslide age. No significant changes in P concentrations or pools were observed in 10 to 35 or in 35 to 60 cm depth intervals across the chronosequence. Labile soil P increased to approximately two-thirds of the pre-disturbance levels in the oldest landslide scar (>55 yr). Thus, plants, their associated microflora/fauna, and P inputs from off-site substantially altered the distribution of soil P fractions during forest recovery. Across the chronosequence, the increase in labile P accumulated in soil and biomass appeared to be greater than the estimated allochthonous inputs from litter and precipitation, indicating that as the forest developed, some occluded P may have been released for use by soil biota. Resin-Pi and labile P were correlated with soil organic matter content, suggesting, as in other highly weathered soils, organic matter accumulation and turnover are important in maintaining labile P pools. Primary mineral P (apatite) was scarce, even in deep soil cores.

AB The control of vegetative phenology in tropical trees is not well understood. In dry forest trees, leaf abscission may be enhanced by advanced leaf age, increasing water stress, or declining photoperiod. Normally, it is impossible to dissect the effects of each of these variables because most leaves are shed during the early dry season when day length is near its minimum and leaves are relatively old. The 1997 El-Nino Southern Oscillation caused a ten-week long, severe abnormal drought from June to August in the semi-deciduous forests of Guanacaste, Costa Rica. We monitored the effect of this drought on phenology and water status of trees with young leaves and compared modifications of phenology in trees of different functional types with the pattern observed during the regular dry season. Although deciduous trees at dry sites were severely water stressed (Psi(STEM) < - 7MPa) and their mesic leaves remained wilted for more than two months, these and all other trees retained all leaves during the abnormal drought. Many trees exchanged leaves three to four months earlier than normal during the wet period after the abnormal drought and shed leaves again during the regular dry season. Irrigation and an exceptional 70 mm rainfall during the mid-dry season 1998/1999 caused bud break and flushing in all leafless trees except dormant stem succulents. The complex interactions between leaf age and water stress, the principal determinants of leaf abscission, were found to vary widely among trees of different functional types.

AB Phenological studies were carried out in gallery and montane forests along the Lencois River in the Chapada Diamantina mountains, state of Bahia, Brazil, between January 1993 and March 1998. Leaf flush, leaf Fall, flowering, and fruiting were followed in 54 tree species (N = 243 trees tagged along trails following the river margin and the valley sides). Both gallery and montane forests exhibited a moderate peak in leaf fall during the dry season (August-October), as well as increased leaf flushing in the rainy season (December-April), Three basic model of leafing activity were noted, although most trees in the gallery forest and in the montane forest were evergreen (82.3 and 57.8% relative frequency, respectively). In both forest types, flowering and fruiting modes were annual, with peaks of activity during the rainy season. The predominantly evergreen mode of leaf fall and leaf flush found in this stud ' v was most similar to that seen in tropical wet forests, while the flowering and fruiting modes were more similar to that of dry forests.

AB The composition, structure, and ecology of epiphyte communities have been intensely studied in tropical rain forests. Studies involving epiphytes, however, are scarce in other vegetational physiognomies. This study examined the composition of an epiphyte community on Vellozia piresiana (Velloziaceae) in a Brazilian rupestrian field, and investigated the factors influencing their abundance and distribution. In July 1998, 98 individuals of V piresiana were sampled inside three transects in rocky outcrops of Serra do Cipo, Minas Gerais, and their height were measured. All epiphytes growing on these phorophytes were counted and identified. Height and branch diameter at which each epiphyre individual occurred were recorded. Luminosity intensity was measured in the upper canopy, middle canopy, and 10 cm above ground 100 phorophytes in the same population; 712 epiphytes were found growing on V piresiana, belonging to six species: Vrisea oligantha (Bromeliaceae; 344 individuals), Epidendrum saxatile (251), Constancia cipoencis (50), Prosthechea vespa (31) Sophronites brevipedunculata (30; all Orchidaceae), and Tillandsia usneoides (1; Bromeliaceae). A higher abundance of epiphytes occurred at intermediate heights on the phorophytes, probably because of an intermediate light incidence at these positions. We found epiphytic species across different distributions, both in terms of height and branch diameter of V piresiana, which may have reflected distinct degrees of tolerance to drought and excessive luminosity. These results indicated that despite the low richness observed in this study, the epiphyte community on V piresiana presented ecological features similar to that observed for tropical rain forests (e.g., phorophyte partitioning and differential vertical distribution).

AB The reproductive biology of Pterocarpus macrocarpus Kurz (pradu) was studied in 37-year-old plantation trees in Thailand to determine the causes of seed and fruit loss. Trees flowered at the end of March or early in April at the end of the hot dry season and start of the rainy season. Flowering occurred over about a one=month period. Fruits developed over the next six months during the rainy season and matured at the start of the cool dry season in October and November. Phenology was similar in the four trees that were studied in detail. Racemes averaged 30 flowers each and each raceme was receptive for several days, although each flower was only receptive For one day. After pollination, floral parts were shed over several days and fruits began to develop. Pradu is entomopholous but its insect pollinators were not identified. The stigma is covered by hairs and a secretion is produced. A high proportion of flowers were pollinated. Then, there was a rapid loss of flowers and Young fruits. These observations and earlier genetic studies indicate the probability of a high level of self-incompatibility in this predominantly outbreeding species. Pradu may have a very late-acting self-incompatibility mechanism found in many other hardwoods, The zygote remains quiescent for six weeks as the endosperm develops. During this time most of the ovules and fruits abort, suggesting resource allocation preferentially to cross-pollinated ovules. Pradu has a high reproductive potential but a low preemergence reproductive success (0.8), which is common for many hardwood species, The major cause Of the low reproductive success was fruit loss during early development. Fruit production may be enhanced by increased cross-pollination among unrelated parent trees. This may be accomplished in seed orchards and seed production areas by the introduction of additional insect pollinators that travel greater distances between trees and by the relatively close spacing of unrelated parent trees.

AB Observations of hummingbirds feeding at flowers longer or shorter than their bills seem to contradict the view that bill lengths of hummingbirds evolved in concert with the lengths of their Flowers. Recent experiments, however, indicate that a hummingbird's ability to feed at artificial flowers of different lengths depends on the widths of the flowers. We examined if the broad range of flower lengths visited by many hummingbird species can be explained by the widths of the flowers. We predicted that both short- and long-billed hummingbirds would include long, wide flower species in their diets, but that short-billed hummingbirds would not include long, narrow flower species because nectar in these species might be beyond the reach of their bills. If so, the slope of the regression for flower width versus flower length should be smaller for flower species visited by longer-billed hummingbirds relative to those visited by shorter-billed hummingbirds. Analyses of data sets for some North American and Monteverde hummingbirds and their food plants were consistent with this prediction, and bill lengths were significantly correlated with the slopes of the regressions of flower width versus length for seven hummingbird species. Comparisons of observed flower use by some Monteverde hummingbird species to flower assemblages generated at random suggest that these significant regressions were not simply a result of allometric relationships between flower lengths and widths, but in some cases reflected active choice by the birds. The two hummingbird-flower data sets also differed significantly in the scaling of corolla width relative to corolla length. In particular, the Monteverde data set contained a large number of long, narrow flower species, which we suggest is a consequence of a different floral evolutionary history and association with ton-billed hummingbird species. The evolutionary effects of hummingbirds and their flowers upon one another are more complex than has generally been realized, and a consideration of corolla length jointly with other floral characters may improve our understanding of hummingbird-flower relationships.

AB Since the discovery of Drosophila pseudoobscura in the tropical highlands of the Colombian Andes during the 1960s, this population has been studied by many evolutionary biologists because of its geographical isolation from the main North American range of this species. We used five highly variable microsatellite loci (DPSX001, DPS2001, DPS3001, DPS3002, and DPS4001) to analyze the genetic structure of three Colombian populations and the genetic relationships with four North American populations. We found that the average heterozygosity was consistent among the three tropical Colombian populations (H = 0.665-0.675), but they had less variability than their North American counterparts. Nonetheless, the genic diversity found in the Colombian populations was higher than that found previously using other genetic markers. The average genic heterogeneity estimate among the Colombian populations (R-ST = 0.042), although statistically significant, was substantially lower than that found among the North American populations (R-ST = 0.088). We identified alleles in the Colombian populations not reported in North American populations, suggesting further divergence between the populations. We estimated that the populations on the two continents diverged ca 80,000 years ago consistent with independent sequence analyses of these populations but contrary to some suggestions in the literature. Finally, we estimated an average effective population size of the Colombian populations to be on the order of 100,000.

AB In some leaf-cutting ant species, minim workers ride on the fragments of leaves as they are carried back to the nest from the cutting site. There is convincing evidence that these "hitchhikers" can protect the leaf carriers from attack by phorid (Diptera: Phoridae) parasitoids, but we consider the possibility of other functions for the hitchhiking behavior. It has been hypothesized that the hitchhikers (1) feed on leaf sap from the edges of the cut leaves; (2) ride back to the nest to save energy; (3) get caught on the fragments as they are cut, and hitchhike because they cannot (or will not) get off; and (4) begin the process of preparing the leaf to enter the fungal gardens in the nest, perhaps by removing microbial contaminants. We observed hitchhikers of Atra cephalotes in 14 nests at the La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica. There was no difference in the proportion of leaf carriers with hitchhikers between day and night. Because the nests we observed were largely nocturnal, more than 90 percent of the hitchhiking occurred at night. The phorid parasitoids are usually considered to be diurnal, so the preponderance of nocturnal hitchhiking suggests other functions in addition to parasitoid defense. Hitchhikers spent more time in the defensive head-up posture during the day, but spent more time in the head-down posture at night. The head-down posture may indicate cleaning or other leaf preparation. The hitchhikers were never observed feeding on sap. Hitchhikers frequently got onto and off of the fragments, and so they were not "marooned." Few hitchhikers rode all the way back to the nest and were often moving on the leaf fragment; these observations make the energy conservation hypothesis less likely, although we cannot reject it. We conclude that parasitoid defense is an important function of hitchhiking but also that there are probably other functions when parasitoids are absent. Based on available data, the most likely possibility is preparation of the leaf fragment before it enters the nest.

AB Neotropical herpetofaunas have been studied at selected Central and South American sites, but intra-regional analyses in the Neotropics have not been possible due to lack of long-term data. A particular problem in interpreting herpetofaunal communities is the large geographic distances between the known localities. Such sampling does not take into account the patchiness of the habitat and this prevents analysis of regional diversity. In this study, five Neotropical herpetofaunal communities within a small geographic area (1600 km(2)) were examined to determine if species composition varies micro geographically. We sampled sites within the Tambopata Province, southeastern Peru. The five sites were surveyed intensively during a two-year period. The herpetofauna of the Tambopata region includes 210 species and, because of extensive sampling, has the highest overall herpetofaunal richness of any known region. Sites were compared using the coefficient of biogeographic resemblance (CBR). The CBRs were similar among all sites but the differences were determined primarily by their positions with respect to the two main rivers of the region and not directly correlated to distance among sites. Sites were also examined by partitioning their species into six micro-habitat classes. Sites were found to differ in their proportions of reptiles and amphibians in each microhabitat class. The results of our study were compared to former investigations of various sites within the Tambopata region and elsewhere. This study identified more species than past investigations in all cases. Species composition was shown to vary at a microgeographic level. Based on our findings, we recommend that future studies examine multiple sites within each region to fully comprehend the herpetofaunal communities that exist in complex rain forest habitats.

AB Distress calls are loud, harsh calls given by some species of birds when they are captured by a predator or handled by humans. We recorded the frequency of distress calls and struggling behavior in 40 species of birds captured in mist nets during the dry season in a Costa Rica cloud forest. We tested the following hypotheses proposed to explain the function of distress calls: (1) calling for help from kin or reciprocal altruists; (2) warning kin; (3) eliciting mobbing behavior; (4) startling the predator; and (5) distracting the predator through attraction of additional predators. Our results did not support the calling-for-help, warning kin, or mobbing hypotheses, Indeed, genera that regularly occurred with kin or in flocks were not more likely to call than non-flocking genera. There was no relationship between calling frequency. and struggling behavior as predicted by the predator startle hypothesis. Genera of larger birds tended to call more than smaller birds, providing some support for both the predator distraction hypothesis and predator startle hypotheses. Calls of higher amplitude may be more effective in startling the predator, Distress calls of larger birds may also travel greater distances than those of smaller birds, supporting the predator manipulation hypothesis, but this requires further testing.

AB Lesser bare-backed bats (Dobsonia minor (Pteropodidae]) are solitary and roost in foliage of understory and subcanopy trees in lowland rain forest. These 70-90 gram frugivorous bats forage in primary and secondary forest and in abandoned gardens. At the Kau Wildlife Area in Papua New Guinea, movements (N = 1041) of four males and four females fitted with radio transmitters were monitored for I to 18 months. Mean home range within 30-day sampling periods was 5.1 ha (N = 12). There were no significant differences in home ranges by sex or by dry-wet season. Females, however, had significantly larger mean core-use areas than males (1.43 +/- 0.61 and 0.65 +/- 0.16 ha, respectively. There was moderate overlap in home range and core-use areas among some simultaneously tracked animals. The long axes of home ranges varied from 150 to 1150 in and the mean was significantly larger in females. Individuals commuted from day roosts to multiple feeding areas, sometimes resulting in disjunct core-use areas and home ranges. Fruits of native Ficus species and the exotic shrub Piper aduncum were staple food items. Piper aduncum grew as dense clusters within early successional habitats, and individual plants ripened 5-20 fruits per night throughout the year.,Ficus spp. grew in primary and secondary forest and fruited asynchronously, but individual trees produced tens to thousands of ripe fruits over 7 to 10 days. Three adult female D. minor were tracked over multiple periods spanning 2.5-18 months. Although each female continued to visit a core-use area containing P aduncum throughout the study, turnover of other core-use areas reflected the ephemeral locations of fruiting fig trees.

AB The diurnal time budget of four herds of white-lipped peccaries Tayassu pecari) was studied using direct observation. The scudy took place from July 1996 to April 1997 in Corcovado National Park, southwestern Costa Rica. We predicted that time budget would be diagnostic of peccaries' welfare regarding food abundance, We considered that a decrease in time spent resting and in social interactions would be indicative of nutritional stress. Peccaries spent 34 percent (+/- 1.7) of their daytime eating, 33 percent (+/- 1.8) moving, 28 percent ( +/- 2.3) resting, 3 percent ( +/- 0.25) in social interactions, and 2.6 percent ( +/- 1.4) in other activities. The time spent resting decreased as the time spent moving and eating increased during the months of fruit scarcity. There were no differences among habitats in the proportion of rime used for each activity. In the wet season, peccaries spent more time eating than in the dry season, probably because of the considerable time allocated to rooting. The monthly variation in time spent on social interactions and the frequency of agonistic interactions seemed to be related to breeding rather than fruit availability. While in the study area, peccaries traveled the longest distance in October, which coincided with the lowest fruit availability . In mid-November, the radio-marked herds left the Study area and returned in January. Analyses of the peccaries, time budget suggest that fruit scarcity at the end of the wet season affected the peccaries' behavior and probably induced them to travel long distances in search of food.

AB This paper examines dung beetle communities in remnant patches of tropical deciduous forest at Veracruz, Mexico, as a case study of the effects of tropical deforestation on biodiversity. The two study areas have a common biogeographic history and similar macroclimatic conditions and have been modified by human activities to different extents. The main difference between them is that cattle, which provide the dung beetle's food supply, are present in only one of the areas. Comparison of the dung beetle faunas sheds light on the relative importance of forest cover versus food supply as the principal factor determining the structure and diversity of the fauna. This comparison, which we broaden through an examination of data from other localities in central Veracruz, permits us to Speculate about what happens to biodiversity when a tropical deciduous forest undergoes modification of varying type and intensity. Where tree cover has been most modified, native forest species undergo local extinction and are replaced by open area species. On the whole, there has not been a net reduction in species richness (gamma diversity) in the fragmented landscape of central Veracruz, although local species richness (alpha diversity) has diminished.

AB We assessed species richness and composition of ant assemblages in adjacent montane forest and secondary (anthropogenic) grassland habitats in the central plateau of Madagascar. We used five quantitative methods (leaf litter sifting, two types of pitfall traps, beating low vegetation, and soil digging) and compared methods within and across habitats. Sample-based and occurrence-based accumulation curves demonstrated that the efficiency of ant inventory methods is habitat specific. Litter sifting, however, was the single most efficient method in both habitats. Overall, our analyses of the relative efficiency of methods recommend the use of sifting and beating in the montane forest site, and sifting alone in the grassland site. In four of five methods, more species were collected in the grassland site (31 spp.) than in the forest site (26 spp.). Occurrence-based accumulation curves based on all methods demonstrated that species richness was similar in the two habitats, reaching a maximum difference of approximately one species. Only five species were shared between the grassland and forest sites. The presence of a high number of ant species restricted to the grassland site (18 spp.) is the first record of high endemism in this habitat in Madagascar and may have strong implications for the reconstruction of the natural vegetation types at the time humans arrived. Their presence suggests that a comparable open habitat, such as montane woodland, shrubland, or thicket, was present on Madagascar long before humans developed the secondary grasslands less than 2000 years ago. These results are contrary to the "classical hypothesis" that the central plateau was a continuous region of closed forest. These results support the hypothesis that the montane regions, including the central plateau, once contained areas of habitat with an open structure and that the endemic ants now found in the secondary grasslands were originally native to such a habitat.

AB A GIS (geographic information systems) database was constructed from aerial photographs, a vegetation map, and topographic map data of the Ngeremeduu Bay Drainage Area (NBDA), Palau, to examine relationships between upland land cover dynamics, environmental variables, and past land use. In 1992, 82.9 percent of the NBDA was forest, 16.6 percent was grassland, and 0.5 percent consisted of village areas. Between 1947 and 1992, there was a 11.2 percent reduction of grassland area primarily due to a 10.9 percent increase in forest cover. These land cover changes led to larger, more continuous stretches of forest and numerous, highly fragmented grassland patches. Significant relationships (P < 0.001) were found between the spatial distribution of forest and grassland cover and slope, elevation, soil pH, and percent soil organic matter. These patterns, however, may have resulted from past farm site selection rather than from ecological relationships. Our results indicate that areas of forest expansion were significantly (P < 0.001) associated with the location of abandoned agricultural communities. In addition, over 92 percent of areas of forest expansion occurred within 100 m of established forest. These results suggest that the proximity of established forest facilitate forest recovery following human disturbance.

AB Resistance and resilience of Najas marina to disturbance by flash floods were studied in a permanent fluvial pool of a Brazilian semiarid intermittent stream. A total of 21 macrophyte samples was collected in the high-rainfall season during two annual cycles (1996-1997). Decreases in macrophyte biomass were positively correlated with flood magnitude (Pearson, P = 0.047), varying from 25 to 53 percent Mien discharges were lower than or equal to 0.5 m(3)/sec and between 70 and 100 percent when discharges were higher than 1.0 m(3)/sec, Macrophyte resilience was greater after Hoods of low magnitude. After floods of 0.5 m(3)/sec, three weeks were necessary to re-establish 88 percent of biomass lost, and after a flood of 1.4 m(3)/sec, six months were needed to initiate N marina regrowth. This population of N. marina in Avelos stream has higher stability in response to small disturbances, but as expected, its resistance and resilience decreases with larger disturbances. In general, the high resistance and resilience of N. marina in response to small disturbances have been observed in intermittent tropical streams, The absence of large floods during the study period and the loan variability of water temperature in this tropical region may have influenced these results.

AB We addressed the interacting effects of a natural large-scale fire and a subsequent major hurricane on relative positions of epiphytes in a subtropical forest. In Everglades National Park, subtropical hammocks (hardwood tree "islands"; burned and unburned) during the Ingraham Fire (1989) were surveyed for trees and epiphytic bromeliads (Tillandsia spp.) one year before, as well as one and five years after, Hurricane Andrew (1992). We measured trees (species, diameter, and status [alive/dead]) and epiphytes (species, height, host tree characteristics, substrate life status, and density). The fire decreased the height of epiphytes during the hurricane because branches and bark of trees killed by the fire were unstable epiphyte substrates in the high winds. Proportions of epiphytes on Quercus virginiana were equally increased after the hurricane in both unburned and burned hammocks; the large size and bark characteristics resulted in greater proportional survival of epiphytes on this species. During the five years following the hurricane, changes in the distributions of epiphytes generally were toward pre-hurricane distributions, but recovery was faster in unburned than burned hammocks. We conclude that disturbances that kill trees are likely to amplify the vertical reduction of epiphytes during a subsequent hurricane and that effects of a single disturbance on plant populations can be influenced by the disturbance history of the system, including different types of disturbances.

AB We examined the interaction between a palm and two bruchid beetles along with several mammal species to explore how poachers and habitat fragmentation may indirectly alter the spatial pattern of seed dispersal, seed predation, and seedling recruitment in central Panama. The large, stony endocarps of Attalea butyraceae decay slowly and bear distinctive scars when opened by rodents or beetles. We determined the final distance between endocarps and reproductive trees (which we call an ecologically effective dispersal distance), the predation status of each endocarp, and the distance between seedlings and reproductive trees. The 68 focal trees were divided among 14 sites and four levels of anthropogenic disturbance. Levels of disturbance included full protection from poachers, light and heavy pressure from poachers, and small island habitat fragments. Ecologically effective seed dispersal distances were greatest for protected sites, intermediate for lightly poached sites, and shortest for heavily poached sites and habitat fragments. Seed predation by rodents increased with distance to the nearest reproductive Attalea and was greatest for fully protected sites, intermediate for lightly poached sites, and least for heavily poached sites and habitat Fragments. Seed predation by beetles reversed the patterns described for seed predation by rodents. Total seed predation by beetles and rodents combined was independent of distance, greatest for fully protected sites, and lower for poached sites and habitat fragments. Seedling densities were always greatest close to reproductive trees; however, the increase in seedling densities close to reproductive trees was minimal for fully protected sites, clearly evident for poached sites, and pronounced for habitat Fragments. Increased seedling recruitment near conspecific trees may in time reduce tree diversity where humans disrupt mammal communities.

AB We studied the phenology and reproductive biology of the stained glass palm Geonoma epetiolata in a premontane rain forest of Costa Rica. This understory specie's is endemic to Costa Rica and Panama. We followed 102 plants for two years and found that G. epetiolata is monoecious and protandrous. Flowering duration at the inflorescence level is three to six months For the male phase and two to three weeks for the female phase; this is one the most extended flowering periods reported fear palms. Flowering in this palm is continuous throughout the year, both at the individual and Population level. This long and continuous flowering pattern may represent an adaptation to increase the chances of reproduction in a environment of high and unpredictable rainfall. The species is self-compatible, but self-pollination is possible only when there is overlap of male and female inflorescences (38% of the cases). Only 28 percent of the stigmas of 1020 flowers received pollen grains and 20 percent developed pollen tubes in the styles. Of A the flowers produced by an inflorescence, 14 percent initiated fruit development but only 3 percent develop into mature fruits. Seventy-six percent of the initiated fruits were aborted.

AB Most tropical plants produce fleshy fruits that are dispersed primarily by vertebrate frugivores, Behavioral disparities among vertebrate seed dispersers could influence patterns of seed distribution and thus forest structure. This study investigated the relative importance of arboreal seed dispersers and seed predator son the initial stage of forest organization-seed deposition. We asked the following questions: (1) To what degree do arboreal seed dispersers influence the species richness and abundance of the seed rain? and (2) Based on die plant species and strata of tire forest for which they provide dispersal services, do arboreal seed dispersers represent similar or distinct functional groups? To answer these questions, seed rain was sampled for 12 months in the Dja Reserve, Cameroon. Seed traps representing five percent of the crown area were erected below the canopies of 90 trees belonging to nine focal tree species: 3 dispersed by monkeys, 3 dispersed by large frugivorous birds, and 3 wind-dispersed species. Seeds disseminated by arboreal seed dispersers accounted for ca 12 percent of the seeds and 68 percent of the seed species identified in seed traps. Monkeys dispersed more than twice the number of seed species than large frugivorous birds, but birds dispersed more individual seeds. We identified two distinct functional dispersal groups, one composed of large frugivorous birds and one composed of monkeys, drop dispersers, and seed predators, These groups dispersed plants, found in different canopy strata and exhibited low overlap in the seed species they disseminated. We conclude it is unlikely that seed dispersal services provided by monkeys could be compensated for by frugivorous birds in the event of their extirpation from Afrotropical forests.

AB Variation in post-dispersal seed predation between mature forest and fallow swidden agriculture sites (young forest) was examined for 26 tree and liana species in Peruvian lowland tropical forest. Exclosures were also used to determine the relative importance of vertebrate and invertebrate seed predators. Although species differed significantly in levels of predation, predation of seeds exposed to vertebrates was high (>75%) for all species, while seed predation by invertebrates was lower and more variable. Seed and seedling predation by insects was significantly higher in mature forest, while seed predation by rodents was higher in fallow areas. Other sources of mortality (primarily desiccation) were higher for seeds in fallow areas. The percentage of seeds moved was significantly different among species bur not between forests.

AB In Amazonian rain forest trees of Vochysia visimaefolia (Vochysiaceae), ants were found to induce twig structures that resembled classical ant domatia. This phenomenon is novel for ant-plants, which commonly develop domatia without the activity of ants. Eight species of ants were recorded inside the domatia of six individual trees, but domatia were most numerous and characteristic when induced and inhabited by an undescribed species of Pseudomyrmex on two trees. To investigate the mechanism of domatium growth, we drilled holes into young twigs: the expansion of the twig diameter surrounding the holes was significantly accelerated, comparable to domatia formation. Domatia induction is discussed as a putative step in the evolution of ant-plants.

AB This paper describes the ant assemblages sampled from rain forest canopies ranging from southern Victoria through to Cape York Peninsula, Australia, and also in Brunei. Specifically, it examines the influence of decreasing latitude and variations in elevation on the character, richness, and abundance of the arboreal rain forest ant fauna, and also the relative contribution of ants to the total arthropod community. The sites that were examined included: cool temperate Nothofagus cunninghamii forest from a range of locations in Victoria; cool temperate N. moorei forest at both Werrikimbe and Styx River, New South Wales; notophyll vine forest in Lamington National Park, southeast Queensland; high elevation notophyll vine forest in Eungella National Park, central Queensland; complex notophyll vine forest at Robson Creek, Atherton Tablelands, north Queensland; complex mesophyll vine forest at Cape Tribulation, north Queensland: and mixed dipterocarp forest in Brunei. Although these sites represent a gradient increasingly tropical in character, botanically speaking, Eungella is less tropical than Lamington because of its high elevation. All samples were obtained by fogging the canopy with a rapid-knockdown pyrethrin pesticide. In all cases, circular funnels were suspended beneath the foliage of individual trees or small plots of mixed canopy. Arthropods were collected four hours after fogging. Following ordinal sorting, ants were identified and counted to morphospecies level. The resulting catch were then standardized across sites as numbers caught per 0.5 m(2) sampling funnel. Generic and species richness were higher at the lowland tropical Cape Tribulation sites than at the sites to the south and was comparable with values in the Brunei site. Species richness was negatively correlated with latitude and elevation. Within the Australian rain forest, the lowland/high land break appears to be the strongest predictor of ant relative abundance, with a weaker latitudinal relationship superimposed.

AB I observed 22 species of birds visiting flowering Erythrina fusca trees at Matamata, Amazonas, Colombia. The large orange flowers of E. fusca are adapted for pollination by birds and are protected from illegitimate visits by a petal that covers the nectaries and anthers until displaced by a Foraging bird. Experiments with Rowers bagged to exclude potential pollinators demonstrated that the Rowers do not open without assistance. At Matamata, patrols are the most frequent visitors to flowering E. fusca, and two species, Dusky-headed Parakeet (Aratinga weddellii) and Cobalt-winged Parakeet (Brotogeris cyanoptera), appear to be the main pollinators. This is only die fourth report of Neotropical parrots acting a, pollinating agents. At least five other parrot species fed on the nectar or flowers of E. fusca but destroyed the Rowers in the process. Orange-backed Troupials (Icterus jamacaii) were the only other species observed opening E. fusca flowers nondestructively and are likely to be pollinators. Hummingbirds were common visitors to E. fusca flowers and some species were found to carry E. fusca pollen; however, hummingbirds were unable to open the flowers themselves and relied on other visitors to open the flowers for them. The number of hummingbird visits to a flowering E. fusca tree was positively correlated with the number of visits by parrots and icterids, but nut with the number of mature Rowers, indicating that legitimate visitors facilitate access by hummingbirds.

AB Although bats are nocturnal, many species emerge from roosts to forage during twilight, despite a presumed high risk of predation at this time. Here, we describe twilight foraging by a maternity colon), of Schneider's leafnosed bat (Hipposideros speoris) in the dry zone of Sri Lanka and determine the dietary benefits of such behavior. Bats usually began foraging during dusk, sometimes before sunset, and also foraged during twilight in the morning. Mean use of available twilight by four radio-tagged bats was 75 percent. Twilight foraging made up, on average, 47 percent of the total foraging time of these bats (range = 25-96%), although twilight consisted of only 12 percent of the available time between sunset and sunrise the next morning. Eight species of potential predators (7 birds and 1 mammal) were observed within a 1 km radius of the colony, of which 5 species are predicted to regularly capture bats. Bats took a wide diversity of prey (11 insect orders, including at least 27 families, and spiders) that ranged in wing length from 2.0 to 54.0 mm. Major orders in the diet were Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, and Diptera, Prey of secondary importance included Hemiptera. Hymenoptera, Isoptera, and Neuroptera. Bats captured large numbers of insects that were only available or had marked peaks ill abundance during twilight. These groups included small, swarming insects (especially flies) that have peaks in flight activity at dusk and dawn, large diurnal species (especially dragonflies) Chat have crepuscular activity, and winged termites that emerge in swarms at dusk. Access to these insects was a clear benefit of twilight foraging.

AB This study reports extraordinarily high density estimates for the wild pig (Sus scrofa) from ail aseasonal tropical Forest site within the species' native range. At Pasoh Forest Reserve, a 2500 ha area of lowland dipterocarp rain forest in Peninsular Malaysia, line transects were used to estimate pig density front May to October in 1996 and 1998. In 1990, 44 sightings of S. scrofa consisting of 166 individuals were recorded along 81 km of transects. In 1998, 39 sightings documented 129 individuals along 79.9 km of transects. Estimated population density was 47.0 pigs/km(2) in 1996 and 27.0 pigs/km(2) in 1998. Sus scroll biomass in this forest was estimated at 1837 kg/km(2) and 1346 kg/km(2) in 1996 and 1998, respectively. Differences between Years were attributed to changes in the density of young pigs, coincident with a mast-seeding year of dipterocarp trees in 1996. Pig densities at Pasoh Forest Reserve were much higher than at other forest locations within the species' native range in Europe and Asia. Because Pasoh Forest Reserve is a forest fragment, two factors likely account for the extremely high pig densities: (1) local extinction of natural predators (mainly tigers and leopards) and (2) an abundant Year-round food Supply of African oil palm fruits from extensive plantations bordering the reserve.

AB Between January and December 1996, the food habits of a relict population of jaguars were studied in 220 km(2) Linhares Forest Preserve, which comprises much of the remaining old-growth Atlantic Forest of Espirito Santo, Brazil. Fecal analysis indicated opportunistic feeding on 24 prey species (N = 101 scats). Mammals represented 87 percent of the total items, followed by reptiles (9.8%) and birds (2.8%). Considering prey weight, 23.4 percent of the items weighed 1-3 kg, 40.5 percent were 3-10 kg, and 27.7 percent weighed more than 10 kg. Analysis of relative prey frequency and biomass indicated that the diet was concentrated in two prey types: long-nosed armadillo and white-lipped peccary. Literature data suggest that forest jaguars rely on the same mammal prey over their entire geographic range.

ID ACCURACY
AB Accurate estimates of forest cover and forest fragmentation are critical for developing countries such as Costa Pica, which holds four to five percent of the world's plant and bird species. We estimated forest cover for Costa Rica using Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper satellite scenes acquired between 1986 and 1991. In 1991, 29 percent (ca 14,000 km(2)) of the land cover of Costa Rica was closed forest cover; of that forested area, ca 30 percent is protected by national conservation policies. Forest loss in a study area representing ca 50 percent of Costa Mca's territory during a five-year period (1986-1991) was 2250 km(2), and the estimated deforestation rate was ca 450 km(2)/yr, or ca 4.2 percent/yr, of remaining forest cover. Forests are almost completely eliminated from the Tropical Moist Forest and Premontane Moist Forest life zones, and the level of fragmentation of remaining forests may be more advanced than previously thought.

AB To study the structure and composition of old-growth forest in the Saraci-Taquera National Forest near Porto Trombetas, Brazil, we established 36 0.25 ha plots and described the vegetation. We collected charcoal from the A2 sod horizon of each plot for radiocarbon dating. Although fires have been very rare in this forest during historic times' the presence of charcoal in these soils indicates fire at some earlier period. The ages (conventional radiocarbon age adjusted to 1997) of the charcoal ranged from 177 to 1547 years. These ages, however, did not correlate significantly with any of several measures of biodiversity or stand characteristics. The relative uniformity of the current old-growth forest indicates that either the prehistoric fires were of such low intensity that they had little long-term effect on the vegetation or that the present stands have progressed to near steady state.

AB On 22 September 1998, Hurricane Georges passed over the Dominican Republic causing extensive damage to a 4700 ha mangrove forest that has been the site of a detailed study of vegetation and ecosystem dynamics since 1994. We resurveyed the vegetation in permanent plots at 7 and IS months after the hurricane to document structural damage of the forest and evaluate early recovery patterns. The intensity of damage was patchy across the landscape. Mortality (greater than or equal to5 cm DBH) ranged from 14 to 100 percent (by density) among the 23 different plots and averaged 47.7 percent across all plots. Reductions in total basal area ranged from 9 to 100 percent, averaging 42.4 percent. Mortality increased by 9 percent between surveys at 7 and IS months post-hurricane. Interspecific. differences in susceptibility to wind damage appeared to be a primary factor contributing to spatial patterns in mortality. Laguncularia racemosa experienced much less mortality (26%) than either Rhizophora mangle (50%) or Avicennia germinans (64%), and plot-level mortality was strongly associated with differences in species composition. There were no clear relationships between canopy height and tree damage at this site. Over 80 percent of the of the surviving R. mangle trees exhibited less than 50 percent crown damage, whereas ca 60 percent of the L. racemosa survivors suffered almost complete (75-100%) crown loss. By IS months after the hurricane, the percentage of L. racemosa trees in the 75 to 100 percent damage class was reduced to 20 percent; in contrast, the health of many R. mangle individuals appeared to be declining, as the percentage of trees in the 50 to 100 percent damage class increased from 16 to 56 percent. Understory light levels, as measured by the gap light index, increased from an average value of 3 percent in the pre-hurricane forest to 51 percent at 7 months after the hurricane and decreased slightly to 47 percent at 18 months. Few saplings (>1 in call and <5 cm DBH) survived the hurricane; 72 percent of the tagged individuals in transect-based plots and 66 percent of saplings in pre-hurricane canopy gaps were killed. Seedling and sapling populations of all three species appear to be recovering rapidly although their densities stilt are lower than in the pre-hurricane forest. It is too early to predict the trajectory of forest recovery, and continued monitoring of the spatial and temporal patterns of forest development is needed to improve our understanding of the role that large-scale disturbance events play on the dynamics of mangrove forest ecosystems.

AB In the Ninole ridges of Hawai'i, we evaluated changes in plant species diversity and composition and the effect of alien species on the growth and recruitment of native species after disturbance by landsliding. We chose nine landslides representing three age categories (young, 4-17 yr; intermediate, 18-42 yr; and old, ca 130 yr) plus three undisturbed forest sites (325-525 yr) to sample and manipulate the vegetation; the undisturbed forest developed on tephra-derived soils underlain by basalt. The ordination of sites and species using detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) showed that species establishing on landslides were different than those found in the undisturbed forest; moreover, a large fraction of the species establishing on young landslides were represented by aliens, mostly grasses and orchids. The manipulation of alien species (clipping of aboveground parts and removal of above- and belowground parts, including soil) on young landslides (< 17 yr) significantly affected seedling growth of the native tree species Metrosideros polymorpha and the recruitment of native species. In addition, the manipulation of grasses and orchids favored the recruitment of a second group of alien species that were uncommon in, or absent from, our study sites. The removal of tephra-derived soils by landslides, in combination with an increased presence of alien species, may greatly alter successional trajectories in the Ninole ridges of Hawai'i.

AB Seasonal drought in tropical moist forest may be the cue for fine root death and turnover, and it may signal root growth deeper to access subsurface water and (or) nutrients. We examined these predictions by measuring fine root biomass (<2 mm diam.) and the timing of root growth and disappearance in an old growth tropical moist forest on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Republic of Panama, in the fifth year of a dry season irrigation experiment. Irrigated soil had greater available P concentrations; however, a more pronounced effect was less stable soil aggregates causing higher bulk density. Irrigation did not affect fine root biomass. Mean (+/- SE) biomass between 0 and 30 cm was 372 +/- 63 g/m(2) within control versus 286 +/- 39 g/m(2) within irrigated plots. Mean biomass between 45 and 75 cm was 74 +/- 7 g/m(2) within control versus 62 +/- 7 g/m(2) within irrigated plots. Dead roots were less than eight percent of the total. We characterized root growth using in-growth screens (1.7 mm mesh) installed between 0 and 15 cm. Root density in the screens peaked soon after the rains began in the control plots but during the dry season in the irrigated plots. Very few dead roots accumulated in the screens, with no differences seasonally or among treatments. We developed a model to estimate birth and death rates of fine roots using root densities in the in-growth screens and the disappearance of roots laced into screens and incubated in situ. Inferred root birth rates were greatest in the early part of the wet season in control plots and in the dry season in irrigated plots. Inferred mortality rates of fine roots less than four months old were reduced by irrigation, but this was offset by much greater disappearance of six- to eight-month-old roots in the irrigated plots. Although irrigation altered the timing of root growth and mortality, roots did not grow year-round in the always-wet soil. Therefore, soil water availability was an important cue for root growth, but an inherent seasonal cycle remained. Fine roots died continuously throughout the year and disappeared quickly.

AB Little is known about seed bank dynamics in Neotropical savannas. We studied temporal variation in seed density, species richness, species composition, seed mass, and seed number in the topsoil seed bank of a savanna on "La Iguana" Experimental Station, Guarico State, Venezuela. Total soil surface sampled was 57,600 cm(2), in 400 cm(2) units, at four times of the year. Seeds from 124 plants from 20 families were encountered. Species composition varied seasonally, but grass seeds dominated almost all the year, both numerically and in species number. Seed density and species richness were highest in the dry season and declined to a minimum in early wet season. Mean density was 1702 seeds/m(2), with a range of temporal variation from 235 to 4624 seeds/m(2). Average seed mass across species by date ranged from 0.97 to 2.53 mg, but because tiny seeds were most numerous throughout the year, the abundance-weighted averages only varied from 0.8 to 1.19 mg. We found a high spatial variability in the seed distribution in the soil throughout the year. There were also substantial changes in the topsoil seed bank among seasons, as a consequence of herbaceous plant phenology and germination strategies, which are rightly coupled with hydroperiodism in Venezuelan savannas. Based on the species-area curves, we concluded that the minimal sampling effort needed to adequately estimate the species richness in the topsoil of this savanna is 11 fold higher than that used in most seed bank studies in tropical environments.

AB Seed germination and seedling establishment patterns have been used to classify species as shade tolerant or intolerant. The main objective of this research was to investigate, under controlled conditions, seed germination of species from different successional positions as well as to follow seed germination and seedling survival under natural shade in the field. The species studied were Solanum granuloso-leprosum, Trema micrantha, Cecropia pachystachya, Croton piptocalyx, Bauhinia forficata subsp. pruinosa, Senna macranthera, Schizolobium parahyba, Piptadenia gonoacantha, Chorisia speciosa, Pseudobombax grandiflorum, Ficus guaranitica, Esenbeckia leiocarpa, Pachystroma longifolium, Myroxylon peruiferum, and Hymenaea courbaril. Field trials were carried out at Santa Genebra Municipal Reserve, Campinas, SP, Brazil, at the forest edge and in the understory. No significant correlations were detected between successional status and seed size or seed water content. Light-regulated germination was resent only in small-seeded species. In field experiments, most species, including the light-sensitive ones, were able to germinate under the canopy, where a low red/far-red ratio predominates. Most species, mainly those of early- and intermediate successional positions, presented low seedling survival rates under shade. Myroxylon peruiferum was the most shade tolerant species, while S. granuloso-leprosum, C speciosa, P gonoacantha, E guaranitica, T micrantha, and S. parahyba were the most shade intolerant. These latter species showed little or no survival under the shade conditions.

AB In Gabon, we investigated the floral morphology and biology of Napoleonaea vogelii (Lecythidaceae), a cauliflorous understory tree of lowland humid rain forest, and made observations on the behavior of insect visitors. The major insects visiting flowers were: a thrips (Ceratotbripoides brunneus), a small moth (Glyphipterix sp.), four species of leaf beetles (Gabonia colae, Gabonia sp. undescribed, Macrocoma sp., and Monolepta sp.), three species of weevils (Endaeus sp. 1-3), and two species of ants (Technomyrmex sp. and Monomorium sp.). In X vogelii, the flower is quite complex, and we propose a floral morphological definition for complexity. Insect visitors are spatially segregated on the flower. The evolution of the morphology and biology of the flower of N. vogelii is influenced by insect visitors, both pollinating and non-pollinating. The thrips are the likely pollinators of the flower.

AB At the Beni Biological Station, Bolivia, we compared the face of seeds of the palm Attalea phalerata dispersed by tapirs to a latrine with that of non-dispersed seeds. Survival of seeds that had passed through tapir guts did not differ significantly from that of unconsumed seeds, demonstrating that tapirs are legitimate seed dispersers of A. phalerata. Experimental and observational studies showed that tapir dispersal can contribute to escape from seed predation by bruchid beetles such as Pachymerus cardo, Nevertheless, the major contribution of the dispersal process may simply be the mechanical barrier to bruchid attack represented by the fecal material covering seeds. Furthermore, total absence of seedlings and adults from the tapir latrine studied suggests that seasonally flooded tapir latrines are not safe sites for A. phalerata.

AB I describe the fruit characteristics of species closely associated with black lemur seed dispersal (i,e., species that are often dispersed by the black lemur and only dispersed by the black lemur in the Lokobe Forest). A black lemur group was habituated and observed during the day and night for all months of the year (total 1272 h). When fruits were eaten, the plant species was identified, the maturity of the fruit and treatment of the seeds noted, and the fruit described in terms of ripe fruit color, husk thickness, fruit length, and seed length and width. Black lemur feces were searched for seeds; these were identified and signs of damage noted. Other potential dispersers feeding on the fruits of species eaten by the black lemur were also noted. The black lemurs were seen eating the fruits of 70 species, Of these, 51 species were defined as closely associated with black lemur dispersal and 16 species had seeds that were either often preyed upon or wasted by the black lemur, or were seen being eaten by other potential seed dispersers. Fruits of species in the former group were often dull colored (94% of species); rarely less than 1 cm long (6%); rarely had seeds less than 0,1 cm long or less than 0.1 cm Wide (2 and 4%, respectively); never had seeds more than 4 cm long or greater than 2 cm wide; and quite often had either thick husks (49%) or thin husks (51%). In contrast, the fruits of the latter group were often brightly colored (75% of species) and nearly always had a thin husk (94%). Also, this latter group included more small and very large fruits and seeds than the former group. Fruit characteristics significantly associated with the former group Were: dull color, thick husk, fruit length greater than 2 cm, seed length 1-4 cm, and seed width 1-2 cm. The extent to which these traits are the result of coevolution between plants and the guild of lemur dispersers that includes the black lemur is not clear, but a coevolved lemur-fruit syndrome remains a possibility.

AB Mistletoes are hemiparasitic plants that frequently depend on frugivores for seed dispersal; yet their seed dispersal ecology is still poorly known. The mistletoe Psittacanthus schiedeanus (Loranthaceae) was studied for a five-month period in cloud forest remnants in central Veracruz, Mexico, to determine its seed dispersal ecology. We hypothesized that dispersal ecology of this mistletoe species is directly affected by the fruit-eating bird abundance, and asked if this species is following the high-investment strategy as suggested by Godschalk (1983). To evaluate this, we determined the morphological and nutritional characteristics of mistletoe fruit, the availability of ripe fruits along the mistletoe fruiting phenology. and the abundance of fruit-eating birds. Because P schiedeanus is dispersed by generalist rather than specialist birds, we asked if this mistletoe species is ripening fruits during the fruit scarcity time (with highest possibilities of being consumed and dispersed by birds). We compared P schiedeanus ripe fruit production to the cloud forest tree leaf fall and fruit production. Psittacanthus schiedeanus matures its nutritious fruits from November to April, with a peak of abundance in January and February. We found a synchrony between the abundance of P schiedeanus ripe fruits and the abundance of Gray Silky-flycatchers (Ptilogonys cinereus) and Social Flycatchers (Myiozetetes similis); however, this was not the case with Cedar Waxwings (Bombycilla cedrorum), although these birds play an important role in the mistletoe dispersal. The fruiting pattern of P schiedeanus, together with the fact that it is an important food resource for generalist rather than specialist frugivorous birds, suggest that this mistletoe is using the nutrient investment strategy to attract dispersers during a time of fruit scarcity.

AB Parasitoid insects face considerable trade-off; in locating suitable hosts within complex environments. Apocephalus paraponerae (Diptera: Phoridae) locates its host ant Taraponera clavata (Formicidae: Ponerinae) using olfactory cues. Here, comparing two populations of A. paraponerae, I describe differences in host location cues between two sites, Barro Colorado Island (BCI) in Panama and La Selva Biological Research Station in Costa Rica. At La Selva, A. paraponerae uses the ant mandibular gland products 4-methyl-3-heptanone and 4-methyl-3-heptanol in host location, but does not do so on BCI I propose that higher colony density of P clavata causes A. paraponerae to use more species-specific cues on BCI. I also discuss how geographic variation in host location cues could lead to allopatric speciation.

AB I compared species richness and habitat correlates of leaf-litter herpetofaunal abundance in undisturbed and selectively logged forests, and an abandoned pine plantation in Kibale National Park, Uganda. I sampled 50 randomly located 25 m(2) litter plots in each area during the wet and dry seasons in 1997. Ten anuran, five lizard, and three snake species were captured in plots over the study. Assemblage composition was most similar at logged and unlogged sites. The logged forest herpetofauna had higher species richness and abundance than the unlogged forest, but diversity was greater in the unlogged forest due to greater evenness. In contrast, the pine plantation site had the highest richness, abundance, and evenness of the three study sites, but species composition was distinct from the other areas. Herpetofaunal densities were significantly lower in all three areas during the dry season than in the wet season. During the dry season, soil moisture, litter mass, topography, shrub cover, and number of fallen logs were significant positive predictors of herpetofaunal presence in litter plots, but only soil moisture was significant in the wet season. The interaction of moisture and topography appears to be important in determining seasonal patterns of litter herpetofaunal distribution. Comparison of litter herpetofaunal studies across the tropics have shown that mid-elevation faunas generally support fewer species than lowland faunas. Compared with other tropical mid-elevation litter faunas, Kibale supports an intermediate number of species, but at lower densities than observed at any other mid-elevation site reported in the literature.

AB I studied the relationship between diurnal raptor diversity, density, and richness, and landscape heterogeneity in continuous primary forests and forests farmed by native Amerindians in the Rio Platano, Biosphere Reserve of northeastern Honduras from January to June 1996 and 1997. I estimated landscape heterogeneity-the variability in naturally occurring and/or anthropogenic habitat mosaics-by mapping the extent and distribution of five human-modified and natural habitats in 24 1 km(2) survey plots. I used the Shannon index to calculate landscape heterogeneity values for the respective plots based on the proportion of total area of each habitat within each plot. Diurnal captor surveys from canopy emergent viewpoints in these plots resulted in 137 observations of 18 species of captors. Four species (Coragyps atratus, Ictinia plumbea, Leucopternis albicollis, and Buteo magnirostris) differed significantly in abundance among heterogeneity classes, Raptor diversity, density, and richness all increased directly with increasing landscape heterogeneity. Landscape heterogeneity was more important in explaining differences in raptor species diversity than the presence or extent of any single habitat or combination of habitats. In contrast to previous studies, my results indicate the importance of indigenous shifting cultivation in altering the naturally occurring patterns of habitat mosaics in lowland rain forest and its effect on bird species abundance and diversity in a rain forest ecosystem.

AB We estimated the relative contribution of fruits and insects as sources of dietary protein in two species of Neotropical frugivorous bats (Artibeus jamaicensis and Sturnira lilium) using stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analyses. An An insectivorous species (Pteronotus parnellii) was also included for comparison. We found constant patterns in stable carbon and nitrogen isotope composition in blood that separated the two species of frugivorous bats from the insectivorous bat. When we used these isotopic values (combined with those of dietary fruits and insects) to estimate the percent contribution of fruits and insects to the diet of the bats, we obtained different results, depending on assumptions and model adopted. We tested models using both delta (15)N and delta (13)C results simultaneously and separately and further used diet-tissue fractionation factors of 3 parts per thousand for nitrogen and 1 and 3.5 parts per thousand for carbon. We found that a carbon-based model with a diet-blood enrichment factor of 3.5 parts per thousand produced the most parsimonious results. The model estimated that A. jamaicensis and S. lilium obtained most of their protein requirements from fruits, whereas P parnellii fed mostly on insects. No sexual or seasonal variations in the diet of the two frugivorous species were detected. We found no evidence that the diet of sexually active females differed from that of nonsexually active females in the two species of frugivorous bats. We suggest that future studies better define isotopic fractionation between diet and tissues of bats using captive rearing and controlled diets.

AB This annorated bibliography is provided in order to assess the achievements and gaps in the literature on vegetative identification of woody plants In the tropics. The bibliography includes 258 references divided into general references (48), pantropical and multi-continental keys (4), Africa (46), Asia (53), Australia and New Guinea (21), and the Neotropics (86). Vegetative keys are not easy shortcuts to the identification of woody tropical plants to species. Identification of sterile material requires as much, if not more, training as that required for using keys char emphasize floral and fruit characters. Nevertheless, the literature surveyed in this bibliography may be helpful to biologists seeking references For the geographic region in which they work, models for the construct ion of vegetative keys and field guides, and/or the types of characters that should be observed in the field.

AB For many soils of the tropics, inputs of organic materials are essential to sustain soil fertility and crop production. Research in the quality of organic inputs, a key factor controlling rates of decomposition and nutrient release, continues to guide selection and use of organic materials as nutrient sources. The relationship between decomposition patterns and the quality parameters of the fresh leaves of six agroforestry species: Sesbania sesban, Croton megalocarpus, Calliandra calothyrsus, Tithonia diversifolia, Lantana camara, and Senna spectabilis, was investigated in a litterbag study over a period of 77 days in the highlands of western Kenya. The litterbags were buried 1 cm below the soil surface and covered with soil of ca 1 cm thickness. Percent leaf mass and total N and P that remained with time strongly correlated with total P and C/P ratio (R-2 = 0.60-0.90) during the first 35 days of study; bur afterwards, correlation was stronger with the initial soluble polyphenolics (Pp)/P ratio (R-2 = 0.69-0.92) than with coral P and CIP ratio. Loss of leaf mass and release of N and P followed the exponential function, y(t) = y(o) * e(-kt), from which the specific decay rare constants (k) were calculated for loss of leaf mass (k(B)) and release of N (k(N)) and P (k(p)). Among the plant species, the k values were lowest in Calliandra with k(B) = 0.012/d, k(N) = 0.017/d and k(p) = 0.044/d. Lantana had the highest k values with k(B) = 0.067/d and k(p) = 0.119/d, but the highest k(N) value of 0.109/d occurred in Tithonia. The k(B) values for all organic materials were lower than their corresponding k(N) and k(p) values, suggesting that leaching of N and P from litters may have augmented the microbial mineralization of N and P. There was a strong correlation between the k(B), k(N), and k(p) values and coral P (r = 0.82-0.36; 1)< 0.01), bur not total N, lignin (LIG), or Pp. Rates of N and P release followed the general trend: Tithonia > Senna > Lantana > Sesbania > Croton > Calliandra. The results indicated that, among the quality parameters studied, total P is the most important factor controlling race of decomposition and N and P release from organic inputs in the area of study.

AB In temperate forested streams, fruit from riparian trees is generally a minor and seasonal component of the allochthonous detritus. In contrast, riparian fruit input to tropical streams is often high and continuous. Detrital fruit is abundant in some forested Hawaiian streams compared to other forms of riparian detritus, and rates of leaf litter processing by macroscopic invertebrates are very low. These observations suggested that fruit is an important food resource for detritivores. A microcosm system was used to measure the rates at which two common detrital fruits, guava and mango, were processed by two common detritivores, the prawn Macrobrachium lar and the gastropod Tarebia granifera. Comparisons of fruit weight loss rates normalized by detritivore weight indicated that M. lar processed guavas at significantly higher rates than T. granifera; differences in rates of mango processing by M. lar and T. granifera were not significant. Microcosms containing both M, lar and T. granifera were used to test for interactions between the invertebrates that affected rates of mango processing. No interspecific interactions were detected. A field study was conducted in Kaiwiki Stream, Island of Hawaii, to determine rates of detrital fruit input and export. Detrital fruit was supplied to the study area year-round, with peaks corresponding to summer and autumn fruiting seasons. Guavas and mangos accounted for 85 percent of the fruit biomass entering the stream and 92 percent of the fruit exported from the stream. Mean daily export rates of guava were 7 percent of input, and export rates of mango were 5 percent of input. These measurements suggested that most of the fruit entering the stream is retained and comprises a substantial food resource for detritivores. Comparisons of the biomass-specific rates at which M. lar and T. granifera processed mangos and guavas with the rates at which mangos and guavas entered Kaiwiki Stream suggested that these invertebrates can process most of the detrital fruit in the stream.

AB In 1990 and 1991, Samoa was struck by two cyclones, Ofa and Val. In the Tafua Rain Forest Preserve on the island of Savai'i, one part of the forest also burned after the first cyclone. Here we report on patterns of regeneration and changes in tree species composition in the Tafua lowland rain forest after five years of recovery from cyclone and fire disturbance. In the unburned area, tree canopy cover increased from 27 percent after the last cyclone to 58 percent, and in the burned area from below 12 to 49 percent. Nine of the ten most common tree species decreased in relative abundance in the entire forest after the last cyclone. One fast growing pioneer species, Macaranga harveyana, now makes up 42 percent of the total number of trees (>5 cm DBH) in the unburned area and 86 percent in the burned area. Large interspecific differences occur in size distribution and there are at least four distinguishable regeneration patterns, which may be related to shade tolerance. Mean number of species per plot was generally higher in the unburned area than in the burned area, while the Shannon evenness index was higher in the unburned than in the burned area only for trees above 1 cm DBH. Species with fruits known to be fed upon by birds and/or bats generally made up a larger proportion of all trees in the burned than in the unburned area. In contrast to other studies of post-cyclone regeneration, in which recovery is often rapid due to resprouting of trees, recovery in the Tafua forest was a slow process with regeneration more dependent on vertebrate seed dispersal than on resprouting.

AB Although lack of seeds can limit forest recovery in abandoned agricultural lands, few studies have documented the patterns of seed rain and soil seed bank in active pastures. To determine if lack of seeds is a limiting factor, we studied the woody species composition of the seed rain and soil seed bank in an active pasture in Barranquitas, puerto Rico. In addition, fruit production of 45 common shrub and tree species was monitored in the surrounding secondary forest. Seed rain was monitored for one year at -2, 0, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 m from the forest edge along six transects. The soil seed bank was sampled in January/February 1995 and October/November 1995 at the same distances from the forest edge along ten transects. Of the 35 species that produced fruits in the forest, 14 species were detected in the seed rain study and only 0.3 percent: of the seeds and 3 species dispersed ro more man 4 m from the forest: edge. Two of the three species were dispersed by wind. The seed bank study showed a similar pattern with a dramatic decrease in seedling density and species richness with distance from the forest edge. More than 50 percent of the seedlings in the seed bank study were Trema lamarckianum. This study demonstrated that few seeds disperse into the pastures and even when a rare dispersal event occurs, species do not accumulate because of short-term seed viability and, possibly, high seed predation. Studies of early secondary forest regeneration have shown that in some cases, forest can recover rapidly in abandoned agricultural lands; bur our results suggest that only a small subset of the forest species will contribute to the initial recovery process.

AB In hardwood subtropical forests of southern Florida, nonnative vines have been hypothesized to be detrimental, as many species form dense "vine blankets" that shroud the forest. To investigate the effects of nonnative vines in post-hurricane regeneration, we set up four large (two pairs of 30 x 60 m) study areas in each of three study sires. One of each pair was unmanaged and the other was managed by removal of nonnative plants, predominantly vines. Within these areas, we sampled vegetation in 5 x 5 m plots for stems 2 cm DBH (diameter at breast height) or greater and in 2 x 0.5 m plots for stems of all sizes. For five years, at annual censuses, we ragged and measured stems of vines, trees, shrubs and herbs in these plots. For each 5 x 5 m plot, we estimated percent coverage by individual vine species, using native and nonnative vines as classes. We investigated the hypotheses that: (1) plot coverage, occurrence and recruitment of nonnative vines were greater than mat of native vines in unmanaged pion; (2) the management program was effective at reducing cover by nonnative vines; and (3) reduction of cover by nonnative vines improved recruitment of seedlings and saplings of native trees, shrubs,and herbs. In unmanaged plots, nonnative vines recruited more seedlings and had a significantly higher plot-cover index, but not a higher frequency of occurrence. Management significantly reduced cover by nonnative vines and had a significant overall positive effect on recruitment of seedlings and saplings of native trees, shrubs and herbs. Management also affected the seedling community (which included vines, trees, shrubs, and herbs) in some unanticipated ways, favoring early successional species for a longer period of time. The vine species with the greatest potential to "strangle" gaps rapidly formed dense cover, had shade tolerant seedling recruitment, and were animal-dispersed This suite of traits was more common in the nonnative vines than in the native vines. Our results suggest chat some vines may alter the spatiotemporal pattern of recruitment sites in a forest ecosystem following a natural disturbance by creating many very shady spots very quickly.

AB Postfire vegetation development was studied at two recent mountaintop burns in the Serra do Caparao, Espirito Santo/Minas Gerais, and the Serra dos Orgaos, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Both fires occurred within the paramo-like "campos de altitude", a system of orographic grass- and scrublands restricted to the highest peaks of southeast Brazil. Data collected included pre- and postfire heights and densities of shrubs and trees, and cover of all taxa. Slopes of different aspect and altitude were sampled at each site to evaluate the effects of varying physical environment on regeneration. Rapid vegetative regeneration was common among shrubs and bamboo, with most taxa surviving fire. Regeneration and postfire colonization rates varied among species, and appeared to depend both on physical variables associated with different slopes, aspects and altitudes, and biotic variables. Most plant species in the campos de altitude show some form of evolutionary adaptation to fire. The distribution or species and plant populations across the landscapes of the campos de altitude appears to be largely the result of fire and its interactions with the biota, local topography, and climate. Results suggest that fire is an integral part of the ecology in these humid, seasonally dry ecosystems. Successful management of these unique and highly threatened systems requires a detailed understanding of the fire regime and aits role in structuring biotic communities.

AB Results of a shadehouse experiment and a field study with seedlings and saplings of Inga leiocalycina Willd. (Leguminoseae), a canopy tree of American lowland tropical wet forests, indicated that plant light environment affects both (1) the degree of root colonization by vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM) fungi and (2) the development of VAM structures in the root. Among shadehouse-grown seedlings, VAM colonization increased with increasing light intensity from a mean of 20 percent (21.5 cm colonized root) at a light level approximating forest understory environments to 47 percent (233.1 cm) at a light level found in centers of treefall gap environments. In contrast, VAM colonization levels were similar between gap and understory habitats among field-collected sapling roots; however, the anatomy of the symbiosis differed between light environments. Roots of light gap saplings had significantly more intracellular fungal coils than understory sapling roots. At subsaturating levels for photosynthesis, light availability appeared to be a limiting resource for this symbiosis, restricting the extent of VAM fungal colonization and development of symbiotic structures. Despite this light-mediated limitation, woody seedlings showed evidence of VAM fungi in 20 to 30 percent of their roots at light levels typical of the tropical wet forest ecosystem in general. I consider these results in the context of forest dynamics, and I suggest that, far woody seedlings, maintaining moderate levels of VAM in understory environments is of long-term benefit because it enables them to respond rapidly to the increased nutrient demand imposed by their increased growth rate when canopy openings occur.

AB The main objective was to evaluate the effects of seasonal variations in air temperature, soil water content, and irradiation on the net rate of CO2 uptake for Agave tequilana growing in a warm subtropical environment (Amatitan, Jalisco, Mexico) and in a temperate subtropical environment (Arandas, Jalisco, Mexico). At Amatitan, the lowest value of positive daily net CO2 uptake (141 mmol/m(2)/d) occurred at the end of the summer rainy season and the highest values during the winter (578 and 921 mmol/m(2)/d); at Arandas, the lowest value (188 mmol/m(2)/d) occurred at midsummer and the highest values at the end of the summer (763 mmol/m(2)/d) and in late winter (572 mmol/m(2)/ d). The highest values of daily net CO2 uptake in both localities reflected prolonged daily periods of net CO2 uptake thar included both daytime and nighttime assimilation accompanied by high rates of nocturnal net CO2 uptake doe to moderate nighttime air temperatures. High temperatures in the summer reduced daily net CO2 uptake at both localities bur in late summer, the nighttime temperatures ac Arandas were moderate, which lead to high daily net CO2 uptake. Leaf succulence allowed substantial daily net CO2 uptake when the soil water content was relatively low during the winter and the spring (January-March). Indeed, appreciable daily net CO2 uptake occurred throughout the year for A. tequilana at both localities, indicating that this CAM plant species can sequester carbon even during prolonged dry periods.

AB Most montane rain forests on the island of Hawaii consist of a closed canopy formed by Cibotium spp. tree ferns beneath an open canopy of emergent Metrosideros polymorpha trees. We used artificial seedlings to assess the extent to which physical disturbance caused by the senescing fronds of tree ferns and the activities of feral pigs might limit tree regeneration. Artificial seedlings were established terrestrially (N = 300) or epiphytically (N = 300) on tree fern seems. Half of the seedlings on each substrate were in an exclosure lacking feral pigs and half were in forest with pigs present. After one year, the percentage of seedlings damaged was significantly greater among terrestrial seedlings (25.7%) than epiphytic seedlings (11.3%). Significantly more terrestrial seedlings were damaged in the presence of pigs (31.3%) than in the absence of pigs (20.0%). Senescing fronds of tree ferns were responsible for 60.3 percent of the damaged seedlings. Physical disturbance is potentially a major cause of seedling mortality and may reduce the expected half-life of a seedling cohort to less than two years.

TI Cost and efficiency of cutting lianas in a lowland liana forest of

ID MANAGEMENT; TREES
AB Liana cutting is a commonly suggested silvicultural practice aimed at reducing the negative impacts of lianas on timber production, bur few experimental studies have been conducted to evaluate the cost and efficiency of this practice. In this study, we estimated the cost of cutting lianas in 12 plots of 0.25 ha each in a densely liana-infested forest of lowland Bolivia, and evaluated the efficiency of this silvicultural treatment in terms of the proportion of lianas missed, the density of resprouting liana stumps, and the number of liana-infested trees after two years of an experimental Liana treatment.
   The cost of cutting lianas in this forest by locally hired laborers was 23.6 (SE = 2.48) person-hours/ha. Considering local cost of labor and the U.S.-Bolivian currency exchange rate at the time of the study, this figure translates to ca $15/ha. Liana density decreased from 2471 (SE = 104.3) to 1.30 (SE = 24.2) liana stems greater than or equal to2 cm/ha immediately after cutting, because 5.5 percent of lianas were left uncut (missed). Slender Lianas were missed more often than lianas with large-diameter stems. Liana species that grow 2-3 m before they start to twine were also frequently missed. Twenty-two percent of liana stumps greater than or equal to2 cm sprouted after cutting. Liana stumps with larger diameters sprouted more than stumps with smaller diameters. Most liana stumps produced only two sprouts. Two years after cutting, 78 percent of trees had no living lianas in their crowns, in contrast to only 13 percent liana-free trees in the control plots. Sixty-four percent of trees still had hanging dead lianas two years after cutting, but only 23 percent of trees were reinvaded hy lianas using dead Liana stems as trellises.
   Liana cutting can efficiently reduce the number of lianas in liana-infest ed Forests, and the effects of cutting lianas last: for ae least two years; however, the treatment is expensive. Thus, we recommend that it is better to view liana cutting as a preventive activity to avoid liana infestation, rather than as a corrective measure after poor management. Liana cutting can be easily conducted along with other reduced-impact logging practices.

AB Hurricanes have been assumed to reduce the reproduction of plants, either directly by leaf stripping and stress or indirectly by reducing pollinators. I examined the pollination and fruit set of a common shrub, Bourreria succulenta, after hurricanes on San Salvador island, Bahamas. Contrary to the assumption of resource limitation, B. succulenta showed unusually prolific flowering after Hurricane Lili stripped leaves from most of the plants in October 1996. I predicted that the abundant flowering would saturate pollinators and that fruit set would be pollination-limited. Fruit set was strongly pollination-limited by 71 percent. Butterflies are probably the major pollinators and were present at the site, but they rarely visited B. succulenta flowers even though flowers were brimming with nectar. Nectarivorous birds (Bananaquits and Bahama Woodstars) visit B. succulenta flowers, but their populations were decimated by Hurricane Lili and they rarely visited Bowers during this time. Fruit set was also severely predation-limited; a moth caterpillar (Gelechiidae) was extremely abundant and ate buds, flowers, and fruits, causing a further 68 percent reduction in fruit set. Together, pollination limitation and predation Limitation reduced fruit set to only 7 percent or less. Predation was also intense in 1999 after Hurricane Floyd and resulted in IL percent fruit set or less. Whether or not hurricanes were the cause of limited pollinators or abundant predators, the resulting low fruit set could have population effects because hurricanes can provide opportunities for the recruitment. of new plants. These results emphasize chat understanding plant-animal interactions may be necessary for predicting the effects of hurricanes on plane reproductive success, which may affect subsequent recruitment. Species on small islands like San Salvador (150 km(2)) with relatively few species may be especially vulnerable to environmental disturbances such as hurricanes.

AB The diet of dingoes (Canis familiaris dingo) in the Australian Wet Tropics was examined by analyzing 383 dingo scars collected throughout the region for the presence of mammal prey remains. The scars yielded 29 native and 4 introduced mammal prey species from 14 families. The most: important species in terms of percentage occurrence in the scars were Melomys cervinipes (22.2%), Isoodon macrourus (17.0%), Perameles nasuta (12.5%), and Thylogale stigmatica (12.5%). The most important families were Muridae (37.1%), Peramelidae (29.5%), and Macropodidae (25.8%). Examination of small-scale habitat preferences revealed species that preferentially use the forest edge ranked significantly higher in the diet than chose that do not, and species that are terrestrial ranked higher in the diet than those that are arboreal. Relative abundance was also a significant factor in the ranked dietary occurrence of each species, with abundant species ranked significantly higher than those that are less abundant. These results suggest that dingoes in the Australian Wet Tropics are opportunistic predators of a wide variety of mammal species, with abundant terrestrial and forest edge-dwelling taxa the most susceptible to predation.

AB Home range sizes and spatial overlap of four sympatric squirrel species were investigated in a lowland dipterocarp forest in Malaysia using a radio-tracking method. The population density of Callosciurus caniceps was highest and C. notatus was next highest, while C: nigrovittatus and Lariscus insignis were scarce. C. caniceps was larger than C. nigrovittatus and C notatus while L. insignis war: extremely small. For females, home range size war smaller in L insignis than Callosciurus spp., which may support the body weight hypothesis. larger species have larger home ranges. Among the three Callosciurus species, female C. caniceps had the smallest home range. These differences were accounted for by habitat characteristics rather than by density or body weight; C. caniceps was dominant in bushy areas and used crowded small trees while C. notatus and C. nigrovittatus used large trees in the forest. In this study, home range rite did not change seasonally; this differs from studies in temperate regions, possibly because food availability is much less viable among seasons in tropical rain forest. Home range overlap among heterospecific individuals was common bur different species seemed to partition space by using different vertical levels of the forest. Consequently, the home range size and spatial overlap of sympatric squirrel species may be affected by habitat diversity in tropical rain forest.

AB Endophytes are microorganisms that live inside plant tissues without causing symptoms of disease. They are a largely unexplored component of biodiversity, especially in the tropics. In this study, leaves from two populations of Guarea guidonia trees (Meliaceae) in the Luquillo region, Puerto Rico, were screened for diversity and composition of endophytic fungal communities. A total of 268 leaf fragments from 14 trees were surveyed. Thirty-eight morphospecies of endophytes were found. Phomopsis, Colletotrichum, Xylaria, and Rhizoctonia-like fungi were the most abundant taxa. Over 95 percent of the leaf pieces had endophytes. Communities had a few abundant species and many species with few individuals The Fungal community from the Guarea population in a forest preserve was more diverse than that From a disturbed area. Fungal communities were stratified according to height within a tree, but no differences were found between blade, petiolule, and rachis. The data suggest thar the smaller and che more scattered the plant fragments sampled, the higher the probability of approaching real diversity values of endophytic Fungal communities.

AB Air temperature, vapor pressure deficit, and light intensity microclimatic gradients were examined along four forest edge and four paired forest interior transects in the East and West Usambara Mountains, Tanzania. Between 14 August 1995 and 11 August 1998, 287, 282, and 196 air temperature, vapor pressure deficit, and light intensity gradients, respectively, were measured along the four forest edge and four interior transects. The relationship between microclimate and distance from the forest edge was examined using piecewise linear regression. All microclimatic gradients were classified into one of nine shapes based on the sign and the size of the two estimated slopes. The relative frequency in the shapes of 65 percent of air temperature gradients, 52 percent of vapor pressure deficit gradients, and 62 percent of light intensity gradients along forest edge transacts exceeded the relative frequency of these same shapes along forest interior transects, indicating that a majority of the forest edge microclimate gradients measured were influenced by edge effects. Yet this result also indicated that approximately one-third of all air temperature and light intensity gradients and nearly one-half of all vapor pressure deficit gradients recorded during this study were affected by factors independent of edge effects per ia and that forest edge microclimatic gradients were temporally nonconstant. For air temperature and vapor pressure deficit gradients, low spatial hut high temporal variation existed in estimated edge width and the relative change in microclimate between the forest edge and interior. For light intensity gradients, both high spatial and temporal variability characterized estimated edge width and relative change in microclimate between the forest edge and interior. The pooled mean edge width and relative change in microclimate between the forest edge and interior across the four forest edge transects for air temperature, vapor pressure deficit, and light intensity gradients were 94.1 m and 2.00 degreesC, 82.6 m and 0.29 kPa, and 60.5 m and 10.6 joules/sec/m(2), respectively. These results suggest that forest edge microclimatic gradients in general may be inherently dynamic and nonconstant.

AB Temporal and spatial changes in floristic composition over a 15-year period in an Atlantic tropical forest in Brazil were analyzed. The data were recorded in live 0.5-ha (50 x 100 m) plots within a 22,000-ha forest reserve. In each plot, all stems greater than or equal to 10 cm diameter at breast height (DBH) were repeatedly inventoried. The overall number of species among all plots was steady over rime but changed within a given plot. In all plots, the proportion for the disappearance of species was 7 percent and that for immigration of new species into the plots was 9.5 percent. Approximately 65 percent of the disappearance occurred between 1986 and 1989, and 74 percent of the immigration happened after 1986. The observed changes in composition evidently were due to natural disturbance and climatic events, such as an unusual four-month drought. Disappearance of species from the plots did nor denote regional extinction of those species, because they persisted elsewhere in the forest reserve. The changes in species composition within the plots and persistence outside them, however, indicated that large areas are required for in situ conservation of tropical tree species. These areas must be large enough for population changes to occur without negative effects on genetic and demographic structures of tree species.

AB A tree species replacement sequence for dry broadleaved forests (tropical hardwood hammocks) in the upper Florida Keys was inferred from species abundances in stands abandoned from agriculture or other anthropogenic acitivities at different rimes in the past. Stands were sampled soon after Hurricane Andrew, with live and hurricane-killed trees recorded separately; thus it was also possible to assess the immediate effect of Hurricane Andrew on stand successional status. We used weighted averaging regression to calculate successional age optima and tolerances for all species, based on the species composition of the pre-hurricane stands. Then we used weighted averaging calibration to calculate and compare inferred successional ages for stands based on (1) the species composition of the pre-hurricane stands and (2) the hurricane-killed species assemblages. Species characteristic of the earliest stages of post-agricultural stand development remains a significant component of the forest for many years, but are gradually replaced by taxa not present, even as seedlings, during the first few decades. This compositional sequence of a century or more is characterized by the replacement of deciduous by evergreen species, which is hypothesized to be driven by increasing moisture storage capacity in the young organic soils. Mortality from Hurricane Andrew was concentrated among early-successional species, thus tending to amplify the long-term trend in species composition.

   DYNAMICS; BASIN; AREA
AB The distribution of lianas (woody climbing plants) on trees in a lowland "liana forest" of northeastern Bolivia was clumped and varied with characteristics of individual trees and tree neighbors. In twenty-four 900-m(2) square plots established to estimate tree (greater than or equal to 10 cm DBH [diameter at breast height]) and liana (greater than or equal to2 cm DBH) densities and to count the number of lianas a tree carried, we estimated a mean of 65 tree species and 51 liana species per hectare. Mean tree density at the study site (564 trees/ha, SE = 23.7) was similar to other tropical sites, bur mean liana density was much higher (2471 lianas/ha, SE = 104.3). Basal area of trees greater than or equal to 10 cm DBH was low in Oquiriquia (19.2 m(2)/ha) in comparison to other tropical forests. Liana diversity, as expressed by the ratio of liana/tree species, was higher in this forest than in any other so far reported. Of trees greater than or equal to 10 cm DBH, 86 percent carried lianas. Four tree species (Astrocaryum aculeatum, Euterpe precatoria, Xylopia sericea, and Astrocaryum fraxinifolium) had a lower proportion of liana-infested individuals than expected based on the mean percent of liana infestation in this forest. Forest plots with similar tree species composition did not have similar liana composition or liana loads per tree, which suggests chat lianas and trees have no specific associations with each other. Lianas showed an aggregated distribution on trees, suggesting a facilitation process in which new lianas use already established ones to climb trees. Lianas of four different climbing mechanisms climbed a similar number of trees. Plots in the forest with high palm density also had high liana density, suggesting that palms and lianas respond positively to common forest conditions in the study sire (perhaps related to successional forest status). Larger-diameter trees carried more lianas than slender trees, bur this relationship was affected by the density of trees 10-30 cm DBH surrounding each tree, which suggests again that the successional stage of the forest in which a tree grows affects the number of lianas a tree carries. We found little evidence to support the idea that lianas were more likely to climb some tree species than others. Instead, larger trees and trees growing in the vicinity of trees 10-30 cm DBH, tended to have more lianas, perhaps as result of longer exposure to liana infestation.

AB Clonal reproduction is a common feature in tropical herbaceous plants and has been shown to be important for recruitment and population maintenance. Although numerous phenological responses (i.e., leaf flushing, flowering, and fruit maturation) have been shown to be associated with seasonality in the tropics, little is known about die relationship between seasonality and levels of clonal reproduction. I examined the temporal and spatial variation in clonal reproduction and its potential trade-off with growth and survival fur a tropical understory herb, Aechmea magdalenae (Andre) Andre ex Baker, Handb. Bromel (Bromeliaceae). I addressed the following questions: (1) how do vegetative growth, survival, and clonal reproduction (i.e., rhizome and ramet production) vary between seasons and between years?; (2) how do these factors differ among populations?; and (3) do simulated dry and wet season light levels cause similar variation in rosette survival and vegetative and clonal reproduction, as found in natural populations? Rhizome and ramet production in A. magdalenae was found to be highly influenced by seasonality During the transition from dry to wet season, there was a significant decrease in survival and a significant increase in clonal reproduction, and rosettes tended to grow at a slower rare. Rosettes in the location with the longest dry season had significantly lower survival, higher clonal reproduction, and a slower growth rate. Clonal reproduction also scarred at smaller rosette sizes in the most seasonal forest. When light levels were manipulated rhizome and ramet production were significantly greater under thr high light conditions, and rosette growth (change in longest leaf length) was significantly lower. Results from this study suggest that A. magdalenae responds to higher light levels by shifting investment from vegetative growth to clonal reproduction. Possible implications of this response to light fur population demography are discussed.

AB Clidemia hirta is a highly invasive shrub in tropical forests throughout the world, but has had little success invading mainland sites and undisturbed forests. In the early 1990s, this plant was found to have invaded an unexpected site, an undisturbed continental tropical forest at Pasoh, Peninsular Malaysia. In 1997, a study was conducted of the C. hirta population at the Pasoh Forest Reserve. A demographic survey of the 50-ha long-term research plot at Pasoh located 1002 C. hirta individuals, 69 of which were reproductive at the time of the study. All but 8 individuals were located in high light gaps or gap edges. Relative growth rates were significantly higher in gaps and gap edges than in the understory, and no reproductive individuals were found in the understory. Mean plant size and dry biomass density increased steadily over the course of the study, while the observed mortality rare was 0 percent over two months. The biomass density of Clidemia at Pasoh was < 500 g/ha at the conclusion of this study, but because the population is confined almost exclusively to high light environments, its density in these sites is much higher. The location of C. hirta plants in gaps was significantly correlated with past disturbance by wild pigs, suggesting that soil disturbance and light availability are essential for their establishment. The implication of this study is that by competing with native species in gaps, C. hirta invasion has the potential to alter forest regeneration at Pasoh. Changing land use practices near the reserve have increased the number of wild pigs, and thus the level of disturbance, which may explain the recent success of C. hirta at Pasoh.

AB We investigated the relationships among interstitial salinity leaf sclerophylly, plant vigor, and population density for the leaf galling insect Cecidomyia avicennine (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae) on its host plant Avicennia germinans (Avicenniaceae). Sampling was done in six mangrove stands and in one varzea forest of Maranhao, northeast Brazil. At each site, ten shoots were randomly taken on five A, germinans trees. From each shout we counted the coral number of galls and recorded the shout length (cm). We also recorded the average length, width, total area, and biomass of leaves per shoot. Leaf sclerophylly was quantified by leaf biomass per unit area (g/cm(2)). Samples of interstitial water were taken by a 1.3-cm PVC tube with 80 cm of depth, and salinity (ppt) was measured with a refractometer. Leaf sclerophylly showed a positive relationship with interstitial salinity (R(2) = 0.77, P < 0.05). We also observed positive relationships between gall density per unit of leaf area (cm(2)) and salinity (r = 0.36, P ( 0.05), and between gal density and leaf sclerophylly (r = 0.40, P < 0.05). The salinity and the leaf sclerophylly together explained 22 percent of the variation in gall density of C. avicenniae. We found a negative relationship between the number of galls per centimeter and shoot length (R(2) = 0.50, P < 0.05). Thus, longer shoots of A. germinans showed lower gall density. Our results suggest that the gall density of C. avicenn iae on A. germinans is affected by the salinity of host plant habitat and by leaf sclerophylly along an interstitial salinity gradient.

AB We provide the first data on nocturnal pollination by bees. Heterophragma qundrilorulare is a self-incompatible hermaphroditic tree solely pollinated at night by the carpenter bee Xylocopa (Mesotrichia) tenuiscapa Westwood, whose pollinating flights were lunar insensitive and unaffected by low nighttime temperatures (2-14 degreesC). The number of carpenter bees visiting a tree per minute and the number of Bowers visited per foraging bout were positively related to the size of the Bora display. We found that floral display size was negatively related to Fruit set but positively related to absolute fruit numbers. In pollen carryover experiments, cross-pollen did nor travel Far in sequences of non-emasculated flowers (up to the 4th flower), bur traveled farther in emasculated flower sequences (up to the 15th flower) as evidenced by fruit set in these sequences. The relatively poor fruit set on trees with many open Rowers may have resulted from deposition of self-pollen on touch-sensitive stigmas, which close on first contact. Because large girth trees Fend to have large floral displays, trees may increasingly realize a higher percentage of fitness through male rather than female function as they age. The steady-state flowering phenology of H. quadriloculare may limit reduction in the female function compared to the cornucopia strategy of many other members of the Bignoniaceae and may also provide a reliable resource for X: tenuiscapa.

AB In many areas of the humid tropics, relatively small patches of forest is the habitat most commonly available for forest-dwelling organisms. To assess resident hummingbird use of forest fragments near the Las Cruces Biological Station in southwestern Costa Rica, we mist-netted birds in five fragments (0.3-20 ha; ca 1300 m elev.) and the station's 226-ha forest preserve (Ca 900-1280 m elev.). From January 1994 through mid-March 1999, we recorded 1069 captures of 21 hummingbird species during 49,900 net hours. Species richness, diversity indices, and capture rates increased asymptotically with patch size, as expected. We captured 16 hummingbird species in both the largest fragment (20 ha) and in the nearby forest preserve. Non-forest hummingbirds did not occur more frequently in the fragments than in the preserve, and all fragments supported a mixture of forest-interior and canopy-dwelling hummingbird species, along with a diverse group of hummingbird-pollinated plants. Phaethornis guy was common at all sites and visited >13 plant species in the fragments during the 1998 dry season (based on analyses of pollen collected from the birds' heads). In contrast, Eutoxeres aquila was found at only the largest three sites (10, 20, and 226 ha) and carried pollen from only one plant species during the 1998 dry season. Lampornis castaneoventris, a high-elevation hummingbird species, was far more common in the fragments than in the preserve, while three species typically found at lower elevations were rare in the fragments and common in the preserve. These distribution patterns could be influenced by local climatic differences because the fragments are higher and receive more cloud mist and annual precipitation than the preserve. Our data show that pollen loads on hummingbird species vary, and this has implications for gene flow among hummingbird-pollinated plants. Although our results are consistent with previous reports that hummingbird species may be less affected by deforestation than insectivorous avian species such as army ant followers, it is important to note that from the perspective of the genetics and demographics of hummingbird-pollinated plants, the important issue is whether appropriate pollinator species are able to move plant propagules among subpopulations of plants in fragmented landscapes. We conclude that the biodiversity of tropical forest fragments as small as 10 to 20 ha is high enough to warrant long-term preservation of these areas, especially if they are located near larger tracts of forest.

Cumulatively, 54 macroinvertebrate and 5 vertebrate taxa were found in artificial and natural tree holes censused over four wet seasons on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. Most of the species were in the insect order Diptera, occurred as aquatic larvae in tree holes, and were detririvore/omnivores. Half (49%) of the collected species are considered specialists in this and similar container habitats, and three invertebrate taxa were previously unknown from tree holes. Successional patterns were weak in tree holes, but some taxa predictably colonized holes shortly after they were filled. The mosquito Culex: urichii was more common and abundant in artificial than in natural tree holes; occurrence frequencies and densities of most other taxa were similar between hole types.

AB Baits and soil cores were used to quantify temporal variation in the use of cattle dung by two species of subterranean termites, Amitermes beaumonti Banks and Hoplotermes sp. nov. (hereafter referred to by genus), during the 1991 dry season in Guanacaste, Costa Rica. The densities of termite foragers of both species were evaluated in cattle dung patches (baits), in the soil beneath each parch (litter, 0-3.5 cm, and 3.5-7 cm), and in the same layers from adjacent dung-free control sites. Dung patch and control plots were sampled 3, 10, 60, or 110 days after 1450-ml dung patches were deposited on the pasture. Amitermes foragers were abundant in 3-, 10-, 60-, and 1 in-day-old dung parch plots with a mean (median) +/- SD of 100 (59) +/- 120 individuals/bait plot, and only 8 (3) +/- 11 individuals/control plot. Hoplotermes foragers were less abundant, with a mean of 22 (0) +/- 87 individuals in dung patch plots and 2 (0) +/- 9 in control plots. Hoplotermes was most abundant in the surface litter under IO-day-old dung patches, where an average of 33 (0) +/- 105 individuals were found. In association with clung patches, Amitermes density was highest inside or directly beneath the dung patch and lowest in the 3.5- to 7.0-cm microsite. In control areas, however, Amitermes was most abundant in the 3.5- to 7.0-cm microsite. Amitermes and Hoplotermes were found in 35 and 9 of the 54 control plots, respectively We believe that the high termite densities associated with cattle dung patches can be explained by the energetic and microclimatic requirements of the termites and the physical structure of the dung. Although neither species of termite is a mound builder, these termites use specialized behaviors to exploit and modify dung patches such that foragers have access to concentrated food resources and partial protection from the dry climate and from their invertebrate predators.

AB The high diversity of amphibians in the central Amazon Rain Forest allowed us to examine the influence of tadpole antipredator defenses on assemblage structure and composition within bodies of water (alpha diversity) and among aquatic sites (beta diversity) at a local scale. During a three-year study of tadpole assemblage composition, we found that the anuran community used a variety of bodies of water for reproduction; these ranged from streams and streamside ponds to isolated forest ponds. The distribution of several tadpole species was negatively related to fish density, while other species coexisted with high densities of fish. Tadpole size did not ensure survival against fish, and few tadpoles avoided fish by hiding in the leaf litter. Controlled predation experiments using a single tadpole species in a no-choice situation were conducted over 24- to 48-hour periods. Nearly al species of tadpoles that occurred in habitats with high fish densities were unpalatable to fish (except Centrolenella oyampiensis), indicating that unpalatability is a major adaptation allowing tadpoles and fish to coexist in this system. Unpalatability (to fish), however, was nor an effective antipredator defense against odonate larvae, the other major tadpole predator in this system. The combination of predation pressure and the antipredator traits exhibited by individual species largely determined the composition of tadpole assemblages in individual bodies of water (alpha diversity). The heterogeneous distribution of predators among bodies water and the diversity of antipredator defenses exhibited by larva amphibians facilitated high diversity in this community (beta diversity).

ID ORGANIZATION; POPULATION
AB Two tropical upland forests, Mount Kupe in Cameroon and Bosque protector Dao Seco in panama, were compared in terms of herpetofaunal species richness and density of individuals. Based on rarefaction, whereby samples are standardized for abundance, Pale Seco had significantly more species of frogs and lizards. Extrapolations to total local species richness, by fitting the Michaelis-Menten equation to the species accumulation curves and by using Chao's estimator, yielded divergent results: more lizard species on Mount Kupe, and an equal number of frogs at both sites. These disparities can be accounted for by differences in evenness, which was higher in Pao Seco. Frog density was significantly higher on Mount Kupe, snake density significantly higher in pale Seco, and lizards exhibited no density difference. Overall, the results revealed a less consistent pattern and more moderate differences than what is known from southeast Asian-Central American comparisons. This outcome is discussed in the light of available knowledge, but quantitative data from African forests are too sparse to allow general conclusions.

AB Increasing human activity in the Yucatan peninsula has led to declines in older stages of successional forest, threatening regional habitat diversity. To determine potential effects of this habitat loss on the region's avifauna, we examined the relative use of different forest stages by resident and migrant birds during the nonbreeding season. We used the fixed width transect method to compare the distribution, abundance, and diversity of forest birds in early (five to ten years old), mid (15-25 years), and late (> 50 years) successional forests in the stare of Campeche, Mexico, in the south-central parr of the peninsula. All stages of successional forest: had highly similar bird assemblages and did nor differ in bird abundance or diversity Both migrant and resident birds occurred across the successional gradient. The majority of habitat specialists, however, were resident birds restricted to late-successional forest, indicating that early secondary growth may not be suitable for all species. Furthermore, resident birds that typically participate in mixed-species hocks attained their greatest densities in the oldest forest habitat. Rapid recovery of pre-disturbance physiognomic features, in addition to high levels of habitat connectivity in the region, may contribute to similar bird communities across a range of successional stages. The high degree of edge characterizing much of the forest mosaic also may allow birds access to different seral stages. Loss of late-successional forest, however, is likely to adversely affect the subset of resident avifauna that depends on unique features of mature habitat such as snags, large trees, and climatic buffering. Conservation efforts in Campeche should focus on the specialized requirements of the most habitat-restricted species while preserving the current landscape mosaic characteristic of the small-scale shifting cultivation system.

AB The Amazon Forest and the Cerrado of central Brazil share an extensive zone of integration. Each of these major ecosystems remains poorly studied; however, the composition of communities at the: contact zone is even less well described. Small mammals were sampled during a ten-week period in a zone of contact between Amazonian forest and Cerrado. The vegetation in the area was a complex mixture of tropical and semi-deciduous forest, and grassland and savanna woodland formations. Mammals were marked and recaptured on 0.25- to 0.5-km transects and vouchers were collected. A total of 19 species was caught (13 rodents and 6 marsupials) in 4621 crap nights. Transitions from one vegetation type to another were abrupt with ecotones frequently ( 5 m in width. The highest alpha -diversity was 7 species in cerrado. Ten of the 19 species were restricted to one habitat and 6 were restricted to two habitats. Three generalist grassland species occurred in more than Mo habitats, all variations of savanna. These data support other research indicating high habitat specificity of vertebrates and plants in the Brazilian savannas. The diversity of habitats within reserves in tropical grasslands must be given consideration in the design of protected areas in order to maximize the conservation of mammalian biodiversity.

AB Although there is growing recognition of the importance of small mammals in savanna ecosystems of east Africa, the ecology and behavior of these organisms are nor well known. We conducted studies on the dietary preferences of one rodent, the pouched mouse (Sacrostomus mearnsi), which is the dominant small mammal in a widespread habitat in central Kenya. To establish the food preferences of this species, we: (1) conducted cafeteria trials in the laboratory whereby individual mice were offered seeds and a selection of herbaceous vegetation from the habitat; (2) surveyed the habitat for piles of vegetation clipped by these mice and identified these clippings to species; and (3) estimated the abundance of plant species in the habitat to determine if the mice were clipping species in proportion to their availability. Our results indicated that S. mearnsi prefers green vegetation to seeds, at least during wet seasons, and that it has a strong preference for forbs. In cafeteria trials, S. mearnsi chose 93 percent green vegetation and only 7 percent seeds. The forb Commelina africana was highly preferred over other food items offered. In the habitat, two forbs, C. aifricana and Monsonia angustifolia, constituted > 40 percent of the piles of clippings, although these two species together made up > 4 percent of the available vegetation. Grasses also were clipped frequently, although in lower proportions than their availability in the habitat. The herbivorous habits of S. mearnsi establish the potential of this species to compete for resources with ungulates, which are abundant in this habitat.

AB The lack of recent critiques about terminology has led to the frequent misuse or confusingly varied use of the words that are more or less specific to the field of terrestrial canopy biology. I provide definitions for ca 170 terms and subterms, with translations into four Languages. Rather than limit coverage to tree crowns, I define canopy biology as the study of life within any aboveground parts of all plans communities, temperate and tropical. This broadened perspective enables ecologists to consider the entire range of challenges faced by organisms living in aboveground plane life, from just above the rhizosphere to the outer limits of plant growth into the atmosphere. Further, this redefinition may reduce the potential for anthropocentric biases in interpreting life on trees or other plants; encourage the use of alternative ecosystems for hypotheses that may be difficult to address in treetops; and promote more general conceptual thinking about life on vegetation, most notably the importance of scaling in ecology. Among the salient points in terminology: the concept of "stratification" has been criticized in part because strata have been defined many ways, bur a flexible application of the word is central to its utility; the source of nutrients is pivotal in distinguishing epiphytes from parasites, rather than the more general issue of an organism's effects on its host; "hemiepiphyte," as currently used, confounds two radically different life cycle strategies, suggesting a new term, "nomadic vine," to describe the strategy typical of many aroids; there is a confusion in the literature caused by varied applications of the word "climb;" locomotor terms may have to be modified as more becomes known about forces underlying limb kinematics; and studies of leaping and falling organisms tend to overemphasize arbitrary distinctions between gliding and parachuting to the detriment of the more critical issue of capacity for "controlled descent".

AB Despite having one of the world's highest deforestation rates, the tropical forest of Rondonia state in the southwest Amazon is virtually unknown in terms of nutrient dynamics. To fill this knowledge gap, the distribution of nutrients in a humid tropical forest located in the Ecological Reserve of Samuel, Rondonia state, was addressed. A total of 474 trees with diameter at breast height (DBH) > 10 cm were mapped at the Ecological Reserve of Samuel, a 20,000-ha area bordering the Samuel Hydroelectric Reservoir, which is located 50 km south of Porto Velho, Rondonia state, Amazon region, Brazil. These individuals belonged to ca 220 species distributed in 41 families. From this total, leaves of 354 trees were collected for chemical compositional analysis; boles of 96 trees and fine branches of 75 trees also were collected. Soil samples were gathered for fertility analysis at two soil depth intervals: 0-50 and 50-100 cm. In general, soils were acidic and very poor in terms of elemental contents. For plants, the highest concentrations of P, K, and Mg were found in leaves and fine branches, and the highest concentration of Ca was in the litter. The lowest nutrient concentration was observed in boles. The nutrient concentrations of leaves collected at Samuel were similar to that found in other terra firme forests of the Amazon region and other tropical forests growing on poor soils. Comparisons of nutrient concentrations among families, genera, and species revealed that only N concentrations were distinct among botanical taxa; the variability found in concentrations of other nutrient were larger and did not reveal any significant differences. Like aboveground biomass, the total nutrient stocks of trees was concentrated in a few large individuals. This fact reveals important implications about the impacts caused by selective logging. Although few trees are cut per hectare in this activity, the effects; on the ecosystem structure, due to the loss of nutrients, may be underestimated.

AB We used a humid tropical elevation gradient to examine the relationships among climate, edaphic conditions, below-ground carbon storage, and soil respiration races. We also compared open and closed canopy sites to increase the range of microclimate conditions sampled along the gradient, and determine the effects of canopy openings on C and P storage, and C dynamics. Total soil C, the light C fraction, and all of the component fractions of the P pool were significantly related co soil moisture, and all but coral soil C were also significantly related to temperature. Both labile and recalcitrant soil P fractions were negatively correlated with the light C fraction, while the dilute HCl-extractable P pool, generally thought of as intermediate in availability, was positively correlated with light C, suggesting that P may play an important role in C cycling within these systems. Total fine root biomass was greatest at 1000 m elevation and lowest at 150 m, and was strongly and positively correlated with soil moisture content. Soil respiration rates were significantly and negatively correlated with fine root biomass and the light C fraction. In forested sites, soil respiration rates were strongly and negatively correlated with total belowground C pools (soils + roots + forest floor). Below-ground C pools did not follow the expected increasing trend with decreases in temperature along the gradient. Our results indicated that in humid tropical forests, the relationships among soil C and nutrient pools, soil respiration rates, and climate are complex. We suggest that frequent and prolonged anaerobic events could be important features of these environments that may explain the observed trends.

AB We used aerial photographs to measure long-term loss of forest cover in dry to mesic forests at Pu'u Wa'aWa'a on the island of Hawai'i. The aerial extent of dense forest decreased 62 percent between 1954 and 1994, and the area covered by grassland increased by 237 percent. We then used field data and modeling to evaluate the consequences of removing cattle to the composition, biomass, and flammability of the grass community. Field studies of exclosures demonstrated that grazing reduced biomass of kikuyu grass (Pennisetum clandestinum) from 770 to 229 g/m(2), and canopy height From 26.8 to 6.1 cm. Grazed kikuyu was unable to carry fast-spreading or incense fires (maximum flame length 70 cm, covering 1.4 ha after one hour), while ungrazed kikuyu could carry catastrophic fires (flame lengths 3.0 m, covering >75 ha alter one hour). In addition, removing cattle from drier areas allowed the spread of fountain grass (Pennisetum setaceum), which created a higher risk of fire due to its architecture and low fuel moistures.

AB Many species of woody plants in Hawaiian montane forests germinate on nurse logs or epiphytically, often developing aerial roots. This study investigated the role of fallen logs, wood fragments, and other forms of coarse woody debris (CWD; 35 cm diam.) in providing habitat for woody species in a forest with waterlogged soils. Oxidation-reduction potentials (Eh) of root mars and nurse logs (-70.1 to 278.6 mV) were higher than the underlying soil horizons (-203.6 to -128.1 mV). CWD volume varied between 135.9 and 427.9 m(3)/ha. Live basal area varied between 18.4 and 29.7 m(2)/ha and increased with rural CWD volume. Seedling acid sapling abundances on nurse logs were correlated with moss coverage and decomposition class. Moss coverage was the only significant predictor of seedling density on nurse logs, whereas moss coverage and log volume were important for predicting sapling density. The proportion of woody plants established on logs was higher than in a younger Hawaiian montane forest sire with well-drained soils.

AB Gap-phase regeneration of tropical mangroves was studied to rest if there were significant environmental, structural, and floristic differences between canopy gaps and adjacent forests with intact canopies. Twenty-five canopy gaps in the low to mid intertidal zone were sampled at two study areas in northern Australia. Canopy gaps at the more equatorial study area were larger and had a higher surrounding canopy. Soil analyses showed that sediment texture exerts strong control on conductivity pH, organic matter, total P, total N and total S. Some soil factors differed between gaps and intact forest, and PAR was significantly higher in gaps. Despite this, propagule and young seedling abundances did not differ between gaps and adjacent forests due to the dominance of viviparous species. Enhanced recruitment of seedlings to the sapling stage was detected in many canopy gaps, although saplings were also present under mangrove forest canopies. Nevertheless, the overall floristic composition, species richness, and species rank abundance were similar between canopy gaps and forests with intact canopies. There appears to be little evidence for specialized gap colonists in tropical mangrove forest as distinct from other tropical forests. instead, gap-phase regeneration of mangroves appears to follow a simple "direct replacement" model in which a species population is replaced by members of the same species in forest gaps. The scope for gap-dependent specialization in mangroves via seed dormancy and fast growth rates, common in rain forest pioneers, may be constrained by thc intertidal environment in which mangroves occur.

AB The relationship between canopy gaps and topography was examined in 12 ha of wet rain forest in lowland western Ecuador. Canopy gap and topographical data were recorded on a 10- x 5-m grid system. Each grid point was categorized as belonging to a low canopy gay (less than or equal to5 m height), a high canopy gap (5-10 m height), or the non-gap forest (>10 m height). Slope position, altitude, slope, and surface rock all influenced proportional gap area. The gap relationship with slope position and slope angle varied with altitude. Proportional gap area was not related to drainage. Irrespective of altitude, the plateaus had the greatest proportion of low canopy gap Followed by the valleys and upper slopes. The mid-slopes and ridges had the lowest proportion of low canopy gap. The proportions of high canopy gap had an almost converse relationship. ils altitude decreased, the proportion of low canopy gap increased in the valleys and on the plateaus, but decreased on the ridges and upper slopes. The relationship of slope to the two gap types also varied with altitude, although no clear trend was evident. The processes controlling che observed topographical relationship of gaps are complex, and among other factors, may be linked to the distribution of live and dead treefalls. Topographic differences in the incidence of canopy gaps can potentially influence local species' distributions.

AB Physical damage caused by litterfall is a source of seedling mortality that can be influenced by environmental disturbances, such as the isolation of forest fragments due to habitat destruction. The impact of physical damage in seedling mortality was evaluated in forest fragments and continuous forests in central Amazonia using artificial seedlings. A total of 11 reserves distributed among three sires were studied: three 1-ha, three 10-ha, two 100-ha, and three continuous forest reserves. In each reserve, ten transects each comprised of ten artificial seedlings were monitored for one year at four-week intervals. Survival curves were compared using failure time analysis, and the effect of reserve size on artificial seedling mortality after one year was analyzed with a categorical model. In the analysis of survival curves, artificial seedling survival was significantly greater in the continuous forest than in the 10-ha reserve at one site only, a result that may have occurred by chance. After one year, artificial seedlings suffered similar mortality due to litterfall among the reserves sampled. Physical damage by litterfall varied from 28 to 35 percent annually in the 1- and 10-ha forest fragments compared to 20 to 24 percent in the continuous forest. Mortality of artificial seedlings in the continuous forest was similar to other tropical sites in which the same method has been used, and may indicate that litterfall plays an important rule in seedling morality in the terra firme tropical forests of central Amazonia.

AB Isoprene (2-methyl-1,3-butadiene), a volatile organic compound produced by many plants, is the principal source of photochemically active reduced compounds in the troposphere. Emission from tropical forest trees accounts for > 70 percent of the annual global flux of isoprene, and under certain environmental conditions, trees may lose a large fraction of their fixed carbon to isoprene production. It is not known, however, if the production and emission of isoprene serve an adaptive role, or are factors that control isoprene emission from tropical trees well understood. We present results from a study investigating patterns of variability in isoprene emission and photosynthesis in two tropical wet forest tree species, Brosimum utile (H. B. K.) Pitt (Moraceae) and Dussia munda (Leguminosae/Fabaceae). We used leaf-level measurements to investigate the within- and among-individual variability in isoprene emission and photosynthetic rates, and looked at how these rates changed with light intensity Leaves of both species showed similar responses to increases in light intensity with photosynthesis appearing closer to saturation than isoprene emission at high light intensities. There was a large difference in both the photosynthetic and isoprene emission patterns of canopy and subcanopy leaves, with canopy leaves consistently showing much greater isoprene flux and photosynthetic rates than subcanopy leaves. This difference was smaller, although still discernible, when differences in specific leaf weight (SLW) were considered. These results suggest that tropical trees exhibit biochemical as well as structural responses to canopy position, with patterns of vertical variability that resemble those seen in temperate trees. These data have important implications for understanding the possible functional significance of isoprene emission and for creating accurate canopy-level isoprene flux models.

AB Propagules of the red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle L.) were subjected to a variety of growing conditions in which light level, anatomical exposure to light, application of the photosynthetic inhibitor DCMU, and genotype were used to infer possible interactions between autonomous photosynthesis and the utilization of internal reserves for the development of roots and shoots. The outgrowth of these organs from hypocotyls was significantly enhanced under conditions favorable for photosynthesis, and chlorophyll-deficient propagules exhibited reduced development compared to sibling wild types. The results suggest that photosynthesis augments processing of carbohydrates derived from maternal sources during early development and differentiation of the hypocotyl, and in combination represent an adaptive trait.

AB We studied the reproductive phenology of isolated populations of Spondias mombin to determine the degree of flowering and fruiting synchrony among populations and to examine spacial and temporal variability in fruit production. The study was conducted on six small islands (1.8-3.5 ha) in the Panama Canal. All individuals (10 cm in diameter at breast height (DBH) were marked in 1991 and censused each year through 1994 to record recruits and deaths. All marked trees were censused monthly for flowering and fruiting activity from April 1992 through December 1995. Spondias mombin was seasonal and highly synchronous in flower and fruit production among islands and across years. Proportions of individuals fruiting varied among islands, years, and tree size classes. There was a positive relationship between probability of fruit production and tree size. Synchronous reproductive activity in S. mombin probably was due to responses to proximate environmental cues such as fluctuations in irradiance, but other factors must have been responsible for temporal and spatial variation in reproductive performance. We suggest that this variation may have been due partly to temporal and spatial differences in pollinator abundance.

AB The mating system in a natural population of Shorea leprosula from Malaysian lowland dipterocarp forest was quantified by allozyme analysis using the multi-locus mixed-mating model. The population was found to be predominantly outcrossed (t(m) = 0.837 +/- 0.066). Variation in individual multi-locus outcrossing rates (range = 0.55-1.00) may have reflected variation in individual self-compatibility heterogeneity in the pollen pool, differences in the mating neighborhood of individuals, or population substructure. Departure from the mixed-mating model was evident from the differences in pollen and ovule allele frequencies. Pollen pool heterogeneity and significant levels of biparental mating (t(m) - t(s) = 0.127, P < 0.01) indicated that the population was most probably generically substructured. The inbreeding coefficient based on Wright's fixation index fur maternal trees (F(a) = -0.078) was lower than that obtained for progenies (F(e) = 0.089), suggesting considerable selection against selfed progenies during growth of seedlings to reproductive size. Incidence of multiple seedlings was observed in a small proportion of seeds, but generic analysis and genotype comparisons shelved that this was not due to apomixis and may have been caused by multiple fertilization.

AB Insect activity often tracks moisture gradients. We studied ant activity, size, and diversity along three moisture gradients in a Panamanian rain forest. Ant activity at baits increased by 25 percent from the dry to the wet season, and > 200 percent on a topographical gradient from a ravine to an exposed plateau. Activity varied little from day to night. Three microhabitats-tree trunk, shrub, and litter-showed different responses to these three gradients. The size distribution of the species pool (N = 63) was right skewed, but the average size of ants at a bait was strongly bimodal. Ants active in moister times and places were not significantly smaller. We suggest that gradients of desiccation risk and food availability were the two most likely causes of these patterns. Two temporal niche axes (daily and seasonal) showed little species specialization, bur half of the common species could be categorized as litter or plant microhabitat specialists.

AB Entomophagy in the riodinid butterfly tribe Eurybiini Is demonstrated for the first time. Alesa amesis caterpillars and adults possess behavioral and morphological traits for feeding on Homoptera nymphs, and oviposition by A. amesis females is mediated by the combined presence of Camponotus femoratus ants and homopteran nymphs. Caterpillars are entirely entomophagous, and do not eat plant tissues. Alesa amesis caterpillars have distinct behaviors for feeding on their prey and for soliciting and drinking honeydew secretions from homopteran nymphs. The leg lengths of entomophagous Alesa caterpillars are shown to be longer than phytophagous relatives. The legs of Alesa are used for prey handling and soliciting honeydew secretions. We suggest that elongation of the thoracic legs has been a general consequence of entomophagy in butterfly caterpillars. This study clarifies our understanding of A. amesis and its interactions with multiple species, and points to behavioral and morphological traits important to interpreting the evolution of entomophagy among caterpillars. Our observations establish the likelihood that other members of Eurybiini may be entomophagous, and suggest that entomophagy may have evolved independently among the Nymphidiini and Eurybiini.

AB Evaporative water loss in Anolis cristatellus from the British Virgin Islands was negatively correlated with the aridity of their habitats. Phenotypic plasticity and/or differential mortality of less well-adapted individuals allowed rapid changes within populations. Here we report the results of two studies intended to differentiate between the two processes. We rook advantage of the end of a major drought to study the rapidity with which populations recovered from unusually dry conditions. Population values changed rapidly from those measured in the past. There was no correlation between long-term habitat aridity and measured water-loss rate, bur the multiyear correlation between aridity and skin resistance to water loss persisted. We also conducted a common garden experiment in which animals from the wettest and driest habitats were housed under intermediate conditions for one month. We detected no change in skin resistance to water loss in any of the three populations we studied; however, the mass of lizards from Sage Mountain increased significantly during the experiment, and their water loss per unit mass decreased significantly. These results support the existence of both phenotypic plasticity and genetic differences resulting from rapid selection within populations. The magnitude and relative importance of the two, however, remain to be determined.

The hats roosted in hollows of four tree species, and the roost entrances ranged from 2.0 to 7.9 m above the ground. Radio-ragged individuals returned to the same roosts day after day with the exception of a subadult female that used at least three day roosts over the course of the study. In their day roosts, S. lilium were inconspicuous, difficult to flush, and easily overlooked. Radio-tagged bats usually roosted alone and emerged significantly later than bars without radio tags.

AB As Neotropical forests are increasingly converted to agriculture (especially pastures), little is known about the impacts on microbial biodiversity. To assess such impacts, I compared spore abundance and diversity of arbuscular mycorrhiza fungi (AMF) in soils from lowland evergreen forests and pastures in Nicaragua and Costa Rica. Species composition, dominance-diversity curves, and Simpson's diversity indices were similar for both forest and pasture soils. Of 28 distinct fungus morphospecies, 11 produced more spores in pasture, while only 1 produced more spores in forest. According to species-accumulation curves, local AMF species richness did not significantly decline following conversion of forest to pasture. Because pastures contained a surprising abundance and diversity of AMF spores compared to native forest, a lack of mycorrhizal fungi is unlikely to limit plant succession, restoration, or reforestation in the pastures studied. At the regional scale, however, species-accumulation curves showed significantly greater gamma (G) diversity of spores in forest. In addition to these trends in diversity, species that sporulated more in pasture tended to have small spores, while the one species that sporulated more in forest had the largest spores. Similarly, only large-spored fungi (>300 mum) showed any seasonal variation in spore abundance, being more common in the wet season.

AB To determine if there were consistent differences in growth, mortality and recruitment on slopes and ridge crests in tropical montane forests, which could explain the (frequent but not universal) low stature of trees in the ridgetop Forests, we analyzed data from long-term plots in Jamaica (1990-1994; sixteen 200-m(2) plots, six on ridge crests and five each on north and south slopes). Mortality was higher on north slopes, while growth and recruitment rates were not significantly different among positions. Soil pH and effects of recent disturbance by Hurricane Gilbert were positively correlated with growth and recruitment, while slope angle and disturbance effects were the best predictors of mortality The patterns we found in Jamaica, that growth and recruitment were not higher on ridge crests than slopes, are different than those found by Herwitz and Young in Australia where growth and turnover were greater on a ridge crest. Therefore, it is not possible at present to make simple generalizations about dynamics of ridge crest versus slope forests in the montane tropics.

AB The mobile crane of the Surumoni project allowed for the first time ever a complete inventory and spatial description of the epiphytic vegetation of a tropical lowland rain forest plot (1.5 ha), at La Esmeralda on the upper Orinoco River, Venezuela. A total of 778 individual vascular epiphytes of 53 species was found, dominated by 19 orchid species and 14 species of Araceae. Fifty percent of all individual plants were obligate ant-garden epiphytes. The distribution of epiphytes was highly dumped and not random. The clumped occurrence of holoepiphytes (complete life cycle on host tree) was the consequence of the rarity of suitable phorophytes (host trees; e.g., size and age) in the plot and the preference of ants for gaps where most of the ant-garden epiphytes were found. In comparison, hemiepiphytes were distributed more evenly because of greater independence from tree suitability. The dispersal modes of epiphytes did not explain their distribution patterns. There was no consistent difference in distribution between anemochorous and zoochorous epiphytes, presumably because availability of suitable substrate is the more important factor for epiphyte establishment and growth. Whereas the vertical distribution of epiphytes could be attributed largely to deterministic factors such as physiological adaptation and requirements, horizontal distribution appeared to be governed by suitable substrate, which in turn seemed to be governed by stochastic gap formation.

AB A one-year phenological study of three columnar cacti, Stenocereus griseus (Haw) Britton & Rose, Pilosocereus sp., Cereus hexagonus (L.) Mill., and a decumbent cactus Monvillea cf. smithiana (Britton & Rose) Backeberg., was carried out in the Andean arid region of La Tatacoa, Colombia. Pollinators and/or dispersers of the cacti species also were studied monthly, and fecal samples were collected for the identification of pollen and seeds. The flowering of all species was prolonged and showed bimodal, multimodal, or irregular patterns. Fruiting in all species also was prolonged and followed flowering with a lag of less than two months. Although there were no simple correlations between rainfall and flowering or fruiting, flower production during the dry season was higher for S. griseus, while Pilosocererus sp. and C. hexagonus showed higher flower production during the wet season. Fruit production was also seasonal, with higher production during the wet season for S. griseus and C. hexagonus. The patterns of flowering and fruiting in M. cf smithiana showed no relationships with dry and wet seasons. The bats Glossophaga longirostris, Carollia perspicillata, Sturnira lilium, the birds Melanerpes rubricapillus (Picidae) and Mimus gilvus (Mimidae), and moths of the family Sphingidae, were identified as pollinators and/or fruit consumers of these cacti species.

AB Fates and growth of Rafflesia patma buds and insect visitation to the flowers were monitored in an evergreen tropical rain forest in the Pangandaran Nature Reserve, Java, Indonesia. Of 59 buds marked in December 1985, 44 percent died before flowering, 7 percent flowered, and 49 percent were still in bud in May 1986. Mammals and birds caused the deaths of buds before they reached maturity Only four buds flowered between December 1985 and May 1986; all were male. Rate of increase in diameter (cm/d) was much faster in large than in small buds. Once opening began, the flower opened fully in 24 to 48 hours; the flower remained open for three to five days before rotting. Only two genera of insects visited a male flower of R. patma: Lucilia and Sarcophaga (Diptera). Insect visitation was highest in the afternoon (1300-1700 h) and on the second or third day after flower opening. The increased number of dies visiting the flower coincided with the increasing odor emitted from it. Results of the present study were combined with information from the literature to construct a life cycle diagram of R patma.

AB Changes in light or water availability can result in synchronous leaf production, concentrating food availability for herbivores of young leaves to only a Few months. To determine the importance of food availability on herbivory, leaf phenology and leaf damage were studied in the Luquillo Experimental Forest (LEF) of Puerto Rico. We studied 20 individuals of eight species for two years. Every month, new leaves were marked; the following month, leaf area and area of damage were measured. Over two years, comparison of leaf production and percent herbivory were performed for each species, and for all species taken together. More than 30 percent of the annual leaf production occurred in May and June. Leaf production was associated with an increase in PFD (photon flux density) and was not related to the patterns of rainfall. Although leaf production was synchronous, there were no differences in herbivory between the peak and non-peak periods of leaf production. Possible explanations for the constant levels of herbivory throughout the year are the presence of a generalist herbivore community the ability of herbivores to track changes in food availability or high densities of herbivore predators that control herbivore populations.

AB We compared the community structure, nutritive quality, and aboveground biomass of grazing lawns (patches of shortgrass communities) to neighboring grasslands in the Terai of western Nepal. Grazing lawns differed from the adjacent grasslands in species composition and community structure. Species diversity and species richness were higher on grazing lawns (H = 1.60, S = 20.93) than the grasslands (H = 0.97, S = 8.97). Fencing that excluded grazers for 150 days made areas of grazing lawns indistinguishable from neighboring grasslands in terms of plans height and biomass. Growing shoots of forage from grazing lawns had higher digestibility, crude protein, and sodium than Forage from the grasslands. Grazing lawns appear to be maintained by continuous grazing and are enriched by deposition of urine, dung, and by certain plant species not found in the the adjacent grasslands.

AB Tropical monodominant forests in which one tree species dominates the canopy occur in all three major tropical regions, but few studies have focused on the mechanisms responsible for dominance. This study teats the hypothesis that relative to ocher species in the community, dominant species are well defended and escape herbivore and pathogen damage. We surveyed the race of damage on young expanding leaves of seedlings and saplings belonging to eight species within both monodominant Gilbertiodendron dewevrei forests and adjacent mixed-species forests in eastern Congo. Results showed that escape from herbivore and pathogen damage is not a mechanism by which Gilbertiodendron achieves dominance, as it suffered the highest damage level of any species surveyed. Similarly, other sub-dominant common species also suffered high rates of damage. These results are discussed in relation to the phenolic, fiber, and nitrogen content of leaves, and in the concert of current theories pertaining to plant-herbivore interactions.

AB Characteristic secondary metabolites are currently acknowledged to play a pivotal role in the circumscription of a plant's insect fauna. A newly discovered association between wood-boring longicorn beetles (Cerambycidae) and their host trees belonging to the Brazil nut family (Lecythidaceae) inspired a yearlong rearing project in the lowland Neotropical rain forest of central French Guiana. Branches severed from five species of Lecythidaceae yielded 1813 cerambycids belonging to 37 species. Two of the five tree species, Couratari stellata and Gustavia hexapetala, yielded impoverished complements of cerambycids that included Large percentages of generalists. Both tree species are characterized by fetid odors. Wood samples collected from the malodorous C. stellata, as well as from two well-colonized species, Lecythis poiteaui and Eschweilera coriacea, were analyzed for their volatile components. Sulfur compounds accounted For almost 15 percent of the volatiles detected From C. stellata, while they were at most minor components of the two well-colonized tree species. S-methylmethionine, isolated from a C. stellata wood sample, appeared to be the major sulfur compound contributing to the distinctive smell. We hypothesize that this foul odor is a deterrent to specialist cerambycids seeking oviposition sites.

AB The effects of dispersal pattern (seeds in small clumps vs. seeds scattered in pain) and distance to the nearest Carapa procera (Meliaceae; a tree that produces seeds preferred by terrestrial vertebrates) on survival of seeds and seedlings were examined for the anima-dispersed tree species Virola michelii (Myristicaceae) in a mature forest at Paracou, French Guiana, in 1992 and 1993. We assessed the putative role of ground-dwelling mammalian herbivores, rodents, and ungulates that filter the seed shadow, acting either as dispersers or predators and thus modifying the original pattern of seed dispersal made by frugivores. We measured the effects of simulated seed burial by rodents using marked seeds and quantified the effect of protecting seeds and seedlings from ground-dwelling vertebrates on seedling germination and survival with fence exclosures in 1992. Dispersal pattern had short-term but no long-term effect on the proportion of V, michelii seeds that survived one year later as seedlings. In the short term, within six weeks, clumped seeds survived better than scattered seeds in both years. Marked seeds that were removed from their site of dispersal were eaten; rodents only rarely buried seeds of V. michelii, and seed burial reduced seed and seedling survivorship. The combined effect of the factors year and Carapa proximity significantly affected seed survival within six weeks. Although six-week seed survival was greater in 1993 than in 1992, seedling establishment was lower in 1993 than in 1992 following a lower rainfall regime during the key period of seed germination (February). One-year seed and seedling survivorship was similar between treatments and years. Seed survival and seedling establishment in V. michelii was dependent on vertebrates in the short term and on climate in the long term. Overall, seed and seedling survivorship depended on a combination of these factors.

AB The genus Dombeya is an important component of tropical forests in west Africa, Madagascar, and the Mascarene islands, bur little is known about the reproductive biology of its members. In this study, we quantified gender variation and flower-size variation in three populations of the dioecious tree Dombeya ciliata, an endemic of La Reunion Island (Indian Ocean). Variation among the three populations was observed for three characters. First, the high elevation population had strict males and females, whereas in the two low elevation populations, males were inconstant, with > 50 percent of the males set a small number of fruit. Second, females showed greater seed production at high elevation. Third, flower-size dimorphism was greater at high elevation because male flowers were larger than female flowers.

AB Few data exist on seed dispersal by frugivorous birds in fragmented landscapes, originating from tropical dry forests, in contrast to more abundant data from tropical rain forests. In this study, we assessed the effect of frugivorous birds in a fragmented landscape of Veracruz, Mexico, now occupied by remnant fragments of tropical semi-deciduous forest and dry deciduous forest, grassland, and shrubby patches on sand dunes. We determined four characteristics related to seed dispersal by birds: the interacting species of plants and birds, the characteristics of these species, spatio-temporal variation in the dispersal system, and the outcome of the process. During one year, we recorded 54 frugivorous bird species and 33 ornithochorous plant species, which engaged in 176 different bird-plant species interactions. Similarity (Sorensen index) of frugivorous bird communities using different vegetation types was high (>70%), suggesting that many bird species used all of the vegetation types. In contrast, the similarity of ornithochorous plant communities among vegetation types commonly was low (<37%), suggesting that most plant species were restricted to particular sites in this landscape. At the landscape level, as well as for tropical deciduous forest, we detected a significant positive relationship (Spearman's correlation of rank coefficient >0.65, P < 0.05) among richness per month of frugivorous birds and plant species bearing fleshy fruits. Seeds of many plant species previously detected in studies of seed rain at the site were eaten by birds during this study. Most seeds of zoochorous species, which are deposited in the dry and decidous tropical forests patches, are produced within these vegetation types (i.e., they are autochthonous species), whereas bird-dispersed seeds arriving in grassland and shrubby patches are produced outside (i.e., allochthonous) and are mostly dy species. Birds are important seed dispersers among vegetation types in this landscape but they have different effects in each one. The four characteristics studied, as well as the landscape approach of this research, allowed us to detect spatial and temporal patterns that otherwise would have remained undetected.

AB Figs are a critical resource for many tropical frugivores, yet they often are referred to as low quality fruits. To determine their nutritional value, bath as a group and for individual species, we analyzed 14 fig species from Barro Colorado island (BCI), Panama, for fiber, tannins, lipids, protein, carbohydrates, amino acids, and minerals. Seeds and pulp were analyzed separately. Fig fruit pulp consisted of about one-third digestible components, mostly carbohydrates with some lipids and proteins. Tannin, lignin, and water-soluble carbohydrates showed considerable variation among species, as did fruit size. Figs contained high amounts of amino acids, such as leucine, lysine, valine, and arginine, and minerals, such as potassium, calcium, magnesium, sodium, and phosphorus. One species, Ficus insipida, contained the highest concentrations of almost all amino acids, many minerals, and protein. Small figs had as much nutritional value per gram as large figs. Free-standing figs had higher percentages of protein, complex carbohydrates, and ash than strangler figs, which had higher percentages of water-soluble carbohydrates, tannins, and hemicellulose. The guild of fruit-eating bats on BCI included ten common species with diets dominated by figs. Fecal analyses and captures at ripe fig trees showed a consistent pattern of resource partitioning. Small bats preferentially ate small-fruited and strangler figs while large bats consumed mostly large-fruited and free-standing figs. Small bats most often ate F. bullenei, which has high levels of lipid and carbohydrates, and F. yoponensis, which has high levels of protein. Medium and large bats most often ate F. insipida, a nutritionally superior species; their second most eaten species was F. obtusifolia, in which the large size may make it efficient to eat. Each bat ate a variety of fig species, supporting the idea that although no single species of fig may be sufficient to sustain frugivores, a mix of fig species can provide a complete set of nutrients.

AB Beetles were collected on 64 trees of four species (Cynometra alexandri C. H. Wright, Rinorea beniensis (Welwitsch ex Olivier) Kuntze, Teclea nobilis Delile, and Trichilia rubescens Olivier) in Budongo Forest, Uganda, using an insecticidal fogging technique. Selected tree species were abundant, taxonomically not closely related, and different in the shape of leaves, growth form, and size, with heights between 7 and 35 m. Trees were fogged in an old primary forest stand, in an area of secondary forest where selective logging was performed, and in a swamp forest. Eight conspecific trees per forest type were fogged. A total of 29,736 beetles were collected from all trees that could be assigned to 1433 (morpho)-species; 41.6 percent were singletons and 89.6 percent of species were found with less than ten individuals. Abundant beetle taxa included Latridiidae (N = 4093), Chrysomelidae (3952), Staphylinidae (2931), Apioninae (2621), and Curculionidae (2457). Most species-rich groups were Staphylinidae (N = 196 spp.), Curculionidae (189), and Chrysomelidae (148). Abundance increased in the order: primary < secondary < swamp forest. Due to the relatively high dominance of some species in the secondary forest, species richness increased in the order: secondary < primary < swamp forest. Beta diversity measures and factor analysis showed distinct differences among forest types bur higher similarity of beetle communities on different tree species within one forest type. The taxonomic distribution of beetles in the secondary forest was more heterogeneous than in the primary forest. Analyses of the data revealed low host specificity even for phytophagous beetles, underlining the importance of habitat structure and chance effects an the spatial distribution of beetles in the canopy of Budongo Forest.

ID DIPTEROCARP FOREST; DISPERSAL
AB Tropical rain forests are characterized by their rich plant diversity and highly diverse insect faunas containing mainly rare species. Phytophagous and parasitoid insects utilizing such fragmented resources often must travel considerable distances to find suitable hosts. For small, weak-flying insects, entry into the fast-flowing air above the canopy can provide one way by which long-distance dispersal is achieved. Using sticky traps placed at different heights in a lowland rain forest of Borneo, we compared the diurnal and nocturnal flight heights of chalcids, a group of mainly very small parasitoids and phytophages, to determine if the air above the canopy was used for dispersal. Most families were represented throughout the range of trap heights, including those above the general canopy. A higher proportion of individuals were trapped above the canopy at night than during the day. Fig wasps were exceptional in that they were trapped almost entirely above the canopy. They included species associated with host trees that do not Fruit in the canopy, suggesting that these short-lived, slow-flying insects actively fly up above the canopy and then use the wind to passively carry them the long distances needed to reach their highly localized and ephemeral hosts. Once the fig wasps detect the species-specific volatiles released by their host figs, they then may fly down into the canopy, where the lower wind speeds would allow them to fly actively upwind to their hosts.

AB The Resplendent Quetzal (Pharomachrus mocinno) is an altitudinal migrant that nests in high elevation cloud forests and migrates toward lower areas during the summer rainy season. It has been suggested that its migratory movements are related to the abundance of ripe Lauraceae fruits. We studied the quetzal diet during two consecutive years, as well as changes in fruit abundance of the plant species on which the bird feeds at El Triunfo Biosphere Reserve, southeastern Mexico. The quetzal was observed Feeding on 32 plant species; of these, 24 are new records in its diet. We chose 20 of these 32 species and studied their fruit phenology for two years in order to describe the relationship between fruit and quetzal abundance. Our results showed that quetzal abundance in the breeding area was correlated with the total number of fruiting species, whereas the correlation between quetzal abundance and the number of fruiting Lauraceae species was only marginal. Additionally, a correlation test showed that quetzal abundance was marginally correlated with total fruit availability (total no. of fruits per month); however, the correlation between quetzal abundance and the number of fruits in the Lauraceae was not significant. Our results suggest that the dynamics of food resources may be playing a major role in the quetzal's migratory behavior. Knowing the bird's diet may aid in characterizing the type of habitat adequate for its conservation. Our observations in this respect suggest that conservation efforts to preserve this bird species should concentrate on the protection of its habitat, including both breeding and nonbreeding (migration) locations.

AB Data on fruit abundance and ecological overlap among Ateles belzebuth, Lagothrix lagothricha Cebus apella, and Alouatta seniculus were gathered during 13 months at Tinigua National Park (Colombia), in an effort to test the following hypotheses concerning competition for fruits. Coexistence is possible because: (1) during periods when fruit availability is limited, the species utilize different resources; and (2) the species have different fruit preferences independent of fruit production in the forest. Differences were found in resource use (diet and habitat) for all four species. Despite these differences, all four devoted large proportions of time feeding on fruit. Fruit abundance influenced their activity patterns. Ninety percent of all interspecific aggressive interactions (N = 69) were seen in fruiting trees. The first hypothesis was best supported, given that all species significantly increased their intake of the vegetative parts of plants during periods of fruit scarcity. Fruit partitioning during periods of scarcity was observed dearly only for one pair of species (C. apella and L. lagothricha). In general, the second hypothesis was nor supported as a mechanism for reducing competition because most fruit species were consumed by more than one primate species. Fruit preferences, however, may be particularly important in explaining differences in niche overlap between the most ecologically similar species: A. belzebuth relied heavily on the fruits of one palm species (Oenocarpus bataua) during periods of fruit scarcity and abundance, while L. lagothricha completely ignored this fruit.

AB I compared the concentrations of N, P, and S in both litter and mineral soil (0-15 cm depth) from three old-growth, tropical moist Forests on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama. Each site was on a different substrate (i.e. parent material), hut otherwise had similar climate, vegetation, and topography. There were no site differences in concentrations of N and S for either litter or soil. Concentrations of litter P and soil-extractable P were greater for the andesite (igneous rock) site than for two sites On different sedimentary rocks; however, concentrations of several other litter and soil P fractions did not differ among sites. Patterns in soil P fractions suggested advanced soil development to the point that parent material has little control of P dynamics. Litter samples from each site, leached in the laboratory, released similar amounts of N, P, and S to the soil, indicating no differences in rates of turnover in the litter and in fluxes from litter into the mineral soil among sites. I expected more site differences in soil nutrient dynamics given vastly different parent materials and soil types (i.e., Oxisol vs. Alfisol) and very shallow soil on BCT chat brings the parent material close to the plant root zone. Erosion and soil mixing may explain the uniformity in soil nutrient dynamics across the sites.

AB As a part of the surveillance effort to monitor the ecological status of Omo Biosphere Reserve in the southwestern region of Nigeria, the aerobic heterotrophic bacterial and fungal communities of the topsoil were investigated in March 1995 and April 1994, before die onset of the rainy season. Four distinct wood-tree plantations, a core strict nature reserve (SNR) area, and a buffer zone were sampled. The topsoil samples (7.5 cm depth), including the litter, were taken with an auger (8 cm diameter) and transported to the laboratory in polyethylene bags. One-gram dry weight equivalent of sample was suspended in 10 ml sterile water, and serial dilutions from it were used fur the estimation of bacterial and fungal densities. The bacterial and fungal densities ranged in the order of 10(6) and 10(3) cfu/g, respectively. Out of the 18 bacterial and 16 fungal species that were obtained, 13 and 12, respectively, were isolated from the core SNR. About 46 to 69 percent of the bacteria and 50 to 83 percent of the fungi species Found in the SNR were absent in different combinations in he plantations and the buffer zone; these variations were significant among the sites monitored. The bacterial and fungal species compositions were significantly different between the SNR and each of he other sires. Proportional distributions within the sires were significant only for the bacterial communities. it would appear hat plantation and human activities have caused significant changes in the distribution and species richness of the heterotrophic bacterial and fungal communities relative to the undisturbed SNR area of the Omo Biosphere Reserve.

AB Genetic diversity and population genetic structure of Shorea leprosula was investigated using seven natural populations distributed throughout Peninsular Malaysia and one natural population from Borneo. The mean population and species level genetic diversity were exceptionally high (H-e = 0.369 +/- 0.025 and 0.406 +/- 0.070, respectively). Heterozygosity varied among populations, ranging from 0.326 to 0.400, with the highest values found in the populations from central Peninsular Malaysia. Correlations among ecological factors (longitude, latitude, and annual rainfall) were nor significant (P > 0.05), indicating that these ecological variables were not responsible for the observed genetic differences among populations. The Bangi adult population exhibited a higher level of observed heterozygosity but lower fixation indices in comparison to its seedling population. All other seedling populations also showed positive fixation indices (F), indicating a general excess of homozygotes. This also may suggest selection against homozygotes between the seedling and adult stages. A low level of population differentiation was detected (G(ST) = 0.117 with the Lambir population and GST = 0.085 without the Lambir population). Furthermore, gene flow (N-m) between populations was nor significantly correlated with geographical distances for the populations within Peninsular Malaysia. Cluster analysis also did not reflect geographical proximity and gave little insight into the generic relatedness of the populations. This may indicate chat the populations sampled are parr of a continuous population with fragmentation having occurred in the recent past.

AB How important is ecotypic differentiation along elevational gradients in the tropics? Reciprocal transplants of two shrubs, Clibadium erosum (Asteraceae) and Psychotria berteriana (Rubiaceae), and a palm, Prestoea acuminata var. montana (Palmaceae), were used to test for the effect of environment and population origin on growth and physiology in the Luquillo Experimental Forest of Puerto Rico. Two sites were used, one at Pico del Este (1000 m in cloud forest) and one at El Verde (350 m in lower montane rain forest). At the cloud forest site, plastic barriers were erected around a subset of the plants to examine if protection from wind affected survival or biomass accumulation. Survival of C. erosum and P. berteriana was nor affected by site, population origin, or the presence of barriers. For P. acuminata var. montana, survival was higher for plants with barriers, but not affected by site and population origin. Plants of C. erosum and P. berteriana at El Verde grew larger than at Pico del Este, but there was no effect of population origin or barrier treatment on biomass accumulation for these species. For 1! acuminata var. montana, there was no effect of environment, population origin, or barrier treatment on biomass accumulation. Light-saturated photosynthetic rare (A(max)) of C. erosum, P. berteriana, and P. acuminata var. montana, as well as leaf anatomical characteristics of C. erosum, were unaffected by environment, population origin, and barrier treatment. On balance, there seems to be little evidence of ecotypic differentiation in these species along the gradient.

AB Cacti growing in forests potentially experience growth limitation due to reduced light availability. To test: this hypothesis, we studied the population structure of Opuntia echios var, gigantea at 15 sites on the south side of Isla Santa Cruz, Galapagos Islands, Ecuador. Populations were located in communities ranging from and scrub at low elevations to closed-canopy tropical dry forest at higher elevations. Ordination confirmed the existence of a strong elevation-vegetation gradient. Opuntia abundance peaked at lower elevations (<ca 30 m), with lower densities in dosed-canopy sites. For populations in scrub vegetation, density declined fairly regularly with plant height. Populations in forested sites had few plants of intermediate height, suggesting periodic recruitment. Scrub populations had random dispersion, while those in forests were aggregated. The change in spatial pattern may be related to a change in primary reproductive mode from asexual propagation via fallen fruits to propagation via fallen cladodes. Height was significantly correlated with stem diameter. Intercepts of these relationships increased toward higher elevations, probably in response to the increasing height of the surrounding canopy.

AB After Hurricane Andrew crossed southern Florida (U.S.A.) on 24 August 1932, native and exotic pioneer species in subtropical hardwood forests (hammocks) regenerated from seed banks. Regeneration occurred in hammocks of metropolitan Dade County and the Long Pine Key region of Everglades National park. The density of the native pioneer Trema micrantha was significantly higher in hammocks of Long Pine Key than in those of metropolitan Dade County. In contrast, the basal area of the exotic pioneer Carica papaya was greater in Dade County hammocks than Long Pine Key hammocks. Although T. micrantha tended to be restricted to areas of soil disturbance (tip-up pits) formed by trees uprooted during Hurricane Andrew, especially in Long Pine Key, C. papaya was located throughout hammocks. These results suggest differences in the regeneration niches in which the native T. micrantha required more specific disruptions (i.e., both canopy and soil) than C. papaya (only removal of canopy) for establishment. A broad regeneration niche could in part account for the capability of an exotic species with a dormant seed bank to invade native subtropical forests following natural large-scale disturbances.

AB This study tested three hypotheses regarding how plants respond to the spatial heterogeneity in light availability in the rain forest understory: (1) understory planes occur preferentially in the lighter parts of the understory; (2) understory palms are more shade tolerant than other understory plants; (3) rain forest plants differ in their ontogenetic response to understory light conditions. The study was carried our in old-growth rain forest in the Yasunf National Park, Amazonian Ecuador. The hypotheses were rested by comparing the distributions of 20 plant species (1454 individuals) over microsites with differing degrees of exposure to canopy gaps to the background distribution of these microsites in the forest. The gap exposure of a given microsite was described by an index based on the number and size of gaps in the canopy to which the sire was exposed. Two plant height classes were studied: 0.80-2.49 and 2.50-5 m. The first and third hypotheses were accepted, while the second hypothesis was rejected. The results for the individual species corresponded well with what is known from earlier studies about the ecology of these species or close relatives, suggesting that the patterns observed can be generalized for Neotropical rain forests. Notably, the most abundant species in the study represent several different life history strategies. Thus, abundance in the rain forest understory can be achieved by several different strategies. This suggests that niche differentiation in terms of response to small changes in understory light conditions may be an important factor in the maintenance of the high local plant species richness of tropical rain forests.

AB Seedling and sapling dynamics in a Puerto Rican rain forest were compared between forest understory and soil pits created by the uprooting of 27 trees during Hurricane Hugo. Soil N and P, organic matter, and soil moisture were lower and bulk densities were higher in the disturbed mineral soil of the pits than in undisturbed forest soils ten months after the hurricane. No differences in N and P levels were found in pit or forest soils under two trees with N-fixing symbionts (Inga laurina and Ormosia krugii) compared to soils under a tree species without N-fixing symbionts (Casearia arboreal, but other soil variables (Al, Fe, K) did vary by tree species. Forest plots had greater species richness of seedlings (<10 cm tall) and saplings (10-100 cm tall) than plots in the soil pits land greater sapling densities), but seedling densities were similar between plot types. Species richness and seedling densities did not vary among plots associated with the three tree species, bur some saplings were more abundant under trees of the same species. Pit size did not affect species richness or seedling and sapling densities. Recruitment of young Cecropia schreberiana trees (>5 m tall) 45 months after the hurricane was entirely from the soil pits, with no tree recruitment from forest plots. Larger soil pits had more tree recruitment than smaller pits. Defoliation of the forest by the hurricane created a large bur temporary increase in light availability. Recruitment of C. schreberiana to the canopy occurred in gaps created by the treefall pits that had lower soil nutrients but provided a longer-term increase in light availability. Treefall pits also significantly altered the recruitment and mortality of many understory species in the Puerto Rican rain forest but did not alter species richness.

AB Phenological characteristics of 453 individuals representing 39 tree species were investigated in two dry forests of the Lomerio region, Department of Santa Cruz, Bolivia. The leaf, Bower, and fruit production of canopy and sub-canopy forest tree species were recorded monthly over a two-year period. Most canopy species lost their leaves during the dry season, whereas nearly all sub-canopy species retained their leaves. Peak leaf fall for canopy trees coincided with the peak of the dry season in July and August. Flushing of new leaves was complete by November in the Early rainy season. Flowering and fruiting were bimodal, with a major peak occurring at the end of the dry season (August-October) and a minor peak during the rainy season (January). Fruit development was sufficiently long in this forest chat fruiting peaks actually tended to precede flowering peaks by one month. A scarcity of fruit was observed in May, corresponding to the end of the rainy season. With the exception of figs (Ficus), most species had fairly synchronous fruit production. Most canopy trees had small, wind dispersed seeds or fruits that matured during the latter parr of the dry season, whereas many sub-canopy tree species produced larger animal- or gravity-dispersed fruits that matured during the peak of the rainy season. Most species produced fruit annually. Lomerio received less rainfall than other tropical dry forests in which phenological studies have been conducted, bur rainfall can be plentiful during the dry season in association with the passage of Antarctic cold fronts. Still, phenological patterns in Bolivian dry forests appear to be similar to those of other Neotropical dry forests.

AB Most orchids studied thus far show long-term resource adjustments to increases in fruit production within a flowering season, but none of these offers rewards to their potential pollinators. If nectar production is energetically expensive, then resources utilized to produce fruits and seeds may be even more limited in pollinator-rewarding orchids than in non-rewarding ones. Thus, resource adjustments may be more dramatic or entirely different in nectar producing plants. In this study we performed artificial hand-pollinations for two consecutive flowering seasons in the nectar producing orchid Comparettia falcata, and tested whether or not fruit set, seed set, and seed viability were limited by the quantity of pollinations or by resources. In addition, we compared mechanisms of short-term (fruit abortion within seasons) and long-term consequences (percent change in leaf length and change in flower number per plant between seasons, probability of shoot and inflorescence production, and mortality) between hand-pollinated and unmanipulated plants. The relationships among plant traits related to vegetative size and reproduction also were examined. Hand-pollinations showed some negative effects. Fruit set was higher in hand-pollinated plants in the first season bur was similar to the controls in the second. Seed set was significantly lower and abortions were higher than in unmanipulated plants. On the other hand, some of our measurements were unaffected by the hand-pollination treatment. Unexpectedly, there were no significant differences between groups in percent change in leaf length, change in flower number per plant between seasons, or the probability of shoot and inflorescence production. Although there was a strong correlation between leaf six and the number of flowers produced within a season, associations between leaf size and traits related to current or future reproduction were not consistent Like other epiphytic orchids, pollination limitation occurred within a single season in C. falcata, but increases in fruit production also resulted in reduced lifetime fitness as estimated by a compounded fitness index. Contrary to all other epiphytic orchids studied, long-term adjustments to increased fruit production in C. falcata through reduction in future growth or flower and inflorescence production were either minor or lacking. Our results suggest that the nature of plant strategies associated with resource constraints during sexual reproduction may be dependent on whether or not plants have evolved traits that are costly.

AB Dioecy in the Solanaceae is rare, occurring in <1 percent of the species worldwide and known in only two species From South America. We report the occurrence of cryptic dioecy in che Neotropical genus Deprea. Studying herbarium material of the Venezuelan endemic; D. paneroi revealed morphological distinctions that tentatively served to divide collections into male and female morphs. This discovery prompted investigation of population structure, crossing studies, and morphometric analyses of 95 individuals from the largest known wild population and a small sample of greenhouse-grown planes. About BO percent: of the population was reproductive, and of these, nearly equal numbers exhibited female or male characteristics. Plants that bore Fruit and small sterile anthers were characterized as female; chose that lacked fruit but produced pollen in large ant hers were characterized as male. The morphology, receptivity, and developmental phenology of pistils were identical in both forms. Crossing studies revealed significant enlargement of the ovaries in open-pollinated female flowers and female x male hand-pollinations. The ovaries in open-pollinated male flowers and male x male hand-pollinations never enlarged. These results suggest that the only legitimate combination is Female x male. Dioecy in the family and possible mechanisms for the evolution and maintenance of dioecy in D. paneroi are discussed.

AB A high frequency of dieback and mortality was found in Rhizophora mangle (red mangrove) in coastal mangrove forests of southwest Puerto Rico. Eight plots were established in a variety of mangrove environments to assess the extent and severity of the dieback and mortality. The imperfect Fungus Cytospora rhizophorae was isolated consistently from stem dieback and associated canker tissues. No other pathogenic microorganisms were isolated. Pathogenicity was demonstrated in greenhouse and field inoculation experiments with C. rhizophorae using young R. mangle seedlings. In field studies of seedlings inoculated, mortality was 33 percent, and greenhouse mortality was as high as 50 percent. Cytospora rhizophorae was isolated consistently from diseased mangrove tissue; the fungus was grown in pure culture and then inoculated into healthy red mangroves, causing cankers. Koch's postulates were fulfilled by infecting R mangle with C. rhizophorae, producing disease symptoms, and successfully re-isolating C. rhizophorae from the diseased tissue. This is the first documentation of the pathogenicity of C. rhizophorae associated with mortality in red mangrove. In the coastal mangrove forests of southwest Puerto Rico, C. rhizophorae may play an important role in the frequency of dieback and mortality in R. mangle, producing slow stem diameter growth and causing frequent stem and root wounds.

AB The Janzen-Connell model of tropical forest tree diversity predicts that seedlings and young trees growing close to conspecific adults should experience higher levels of damage and mortality from herbivorous insects, with the adult trees acting as either an attractant or source of the herbivores. Previous research in a seasonal forest showed that this pattern of distance-dependent herbivory occurred in me early wet season during the peak of new leaf production. I hypothesized that distance-dependent herbivory may occur at this rime because the new foliage in the canopy attracts high numbers of herbivores that are limited to feeding on young leaves. As a consequence, seedlings and saplings growing close to these adults are more likely to be discovered and damaged by these herbivores. In the late wet season, when there is little leaf production in the canopy, leaf damage is spread more evenly throughout the forest and distance dependence disappears. I tested three predictions based on this hypothesis: (1) the same species of insect herbivores attack young and adult trees of a given plant species; (2) herbivore densities increase on adult trees during leaf production; and (3) herbivore densities in the understory rise during the course of the wet season. Censuses were conducted on adults and saplings of two tree species, Quararibea asterolepis and Alseis blackiana. Adults and saplings of both species had largely the same suite of chewing herbivore species. On adults of Q. asterolepis the density of chewing herbivores increased 6-10 times during leaf production, bur there was no increase in herbivore density on adults of A. blackiana. Herbivore densities increased 4.5 times on A. blackiana saplings and 8.9 times on Q. asterolepis saplings during the wet season, but there were no clear trends on the adults of either species. These results suggest that the potential of adult trees as a source of herbivores on saplings depends on the value of new leaves to a tree species' herbivores, which may differ across tree species.

AB To examine interspecific variation in the intensity of ant defense among three sympatric species of obligate myrmecophytes of Macaranga (Euphorbiaceae), we measured the ratio of ant biomass to plant biomass, ant aggressiveness to artificial damage on host plants, and increase in herbivore damage on host plants when symbiont ants were removed. increase in herbivore damage from two- and four-week ant exclusion varied significantly among the three species. The decreasing order of vulnerability to herbivory was M. winkleri, M. trachyphylla, and M. beccariana. The ant/plant biomass ratio (= rate of the dry weight of whole ant colonies to the dry weight of whole aboveground plant parts) and ant agressiveness also varied significantly among the three species; the orders of both the ant/plant biomass ratio and ant aggressiveness were the same as in the herbivory increase. These results indicated that the intensity of ant defense differs predictably among sympatric species of obligate myrmecophytes on Macaranga. In addition to the interspecific difference in the total intensity of ant defense, when symbiont ants were excluded, both patterns of within-plant variation in the amount of herbivore damage and compositions of herbivore species that caused the damage differed among species. This suggests that the three Macaranga species have different systems of ant defense with reference to what parts of plant tissue are protected and what herbivorous species are avoided by ant defense. Thus, it is important to consider the interspecific variation in ant defense among Macaranga species to understand the herbivore community on Macaranga plants and the mechanisms that promote the coexistence of multiple Macaranga myrmecophytes.

AB Dispersal quality, as estimated by the cumulative effects of dispersal, germination, seed predation, and seedling survival, was examined for Beilschmiedia pendula (Lauraceae) in Monteverde, Costa Rica. I determined, the pattern of dispersal by finding seeds deposited by birds, protected che seeds from seed predators with cages to assess germination and seedling survival, and examined seed predation races with marked seeds. Seed predation, germination, and seedling survival were compared between seeds naturally dispersed by birds and seeds placed at randomly located sires.
   Approximately 70 percent of seeds dispersed by birds (N = 244) were deposited <10 m from crown edges of fruiting B. pendula trees, although some seeds were dispersed at least 70 m away. Larger seeds were more likely to be dispersed under or close to the parent trees, and larger seeds produced larger seedlings. Seed size was not correlated directly with seedling survival, but larger seedlings at three months were most: likely to survive one year. Seed predation by mammals and insects and seedling mortality due to fungal pathogens were concentrated beneath the crowns of parent trees. Seedlings and saplings were more abundant beneath fruiting B. pendula trees, but individuals farther away were caller on average. Thus, dispersal is beneficial for B. pendula, but such benefits appear most pronounced at a small spatial scale; seeds dispersed >30 m from the crown edges actually had a lower probability of survival than those dispersed 10-20 m. Only 10 percent of B. pendula seeds received high-quality dispersal in terms of landing in the zone with the highest per seed probability of seedling survival 10-20 m from parental crowns.

AB We examined characteristics of roosting sites utilized by two flying fox species (Pteropus tonganus and P. samoensis) in American Samoa. The colonial roosting sites of P. tonganus were observed over a ten-year period, including two years when severe hurricanes devastated bar populations and destroyed roost trees. Prior to the hurricanes, roosts were located on cliff Faces above the ocean or steep mountainsides, locations that were either inaccessible to people or in protected areas where hunting was not allowed. In the years immediately following the hurricanes, P. tonganus colonies split into smaller groups chat moved frequently to different locations. Four years after the second hurricane, colonies had coalesced and returned to many of the traditional roosting sites used before the hurricanes. Common tree species in upland and coastal forest were selected as roosts. The isolated locations selected for P. tonganus roosts were apparently the result of hunting pressure on the colonies. The solitary roosts of P. samoensis were observed during 23 months. Roosting bars were well concealed and hard to detect within the forest; even bats on exposed branches were cryptic. Mature primary forest was favored as roosting habitat. Individual bats used specific branches or trees as roosts and returned to them for up co 29 months. Unlike I! tonganus, people did not alarm roosting P. samoensis easily and some roosts were located near houses and along roads.

AB Two of the main hypotheses to explain the distribution and special characteristics of tropical heath forest are nutrient and water limitation. A study was undertaken to investigate both factors on two sires under tropical heath forest (Badas Forest Reserve) and mixed-dipterocarp forest (Andulau Forest Reserve) in Brunei. Soil water potentials wore monitored at depths of 20, 50, and 90 cm over wet and dry periods for five months at each site. The results showed the mixed-dipterocarp forest sire to be drier at 50 cm depth compared to the tropical heath forest sire. There was no significant difference in water potentials between sites at 20 or 90 cm. Nutrient concentrations in the soil solution were monitored at the same depths over a seven-month period at the same sites. A 12-month litterfall study was also undertaken to monitor nutrient returns from the canopy at each site, The results of both studies suggest that the tropical heath forest sire is poorer in nitrogen, bur richer in calcium, than the mixed-dipterocarp forest site. The results for phosphorus are less clear, but do not suggest that its limitation is a significant factor at the tropical heath forest site compared to the mixed-dipterocarp forest site. Phosphorus and magnesium concentrations in the soil solution showed a strong positive correlation with sliding 30-day rainfall totals at both sites.

AB Neocropical mangrove ecosystems have undergone drastic changes in terms of extension and Aoristic composition during Plio-Pleistocene times. It is unclear if the northern Pacific coast of Colombia has been occupied continuously by mangroves during the last 5000 years, or if their presence is a recent phenomenon. Two basic questions were asked: (1) is the establishment of mangroves recent?: and (2) what were the dominant floral taxa during the late Holocene? In the Gulf of Tribuga, northern Colombian Pacific, 22 sediment cores were drilled to a maximum depth of 2 m in a diverse suite of mangrove substrates and positions relative to the shoreline. Data were gathered from sedimentological descriptions, palynological analyses, and radiocarbon dating of these cores. During the last 4500 years, mangroves in the southern area of the Tribuga Gulf have remained floristically stable and dominated by Rhizophora. The abundant presence of Acrostichum aureum is recent, probably related to human activities. Tn contrast, two areas in the northern part of the Gulf show a different history. In the first area, the establishment of mangrove has been relatively recent (ca 2600 yr), probably a result of local subsidence due to tectonic Faulting; this mangrove forest was and is dominated by Pelliciera rhizophorae. In the second area, mangrove pollen was not found in sediments younger than 2500 years, suggesting that the scarce presence of mangrove in the area is a result of recent colonization, and not due to logging as previously thought.

AB The species composition in the soil seed bank of degraded hillslopes in southern Wello, Ethiopia, was assessed using the seedling emergence method and compared with chat of the standing vegetation. Surface soils were sampled at Oto 5-cm depth from 49 plots of four physiognomic vegetation classes (hereafter vegetation classes): forests, shrublands, grasslands, and degraded sires. Soils were spread on sterile sand in a glasshouse and watered. Emerging seedlings were recorded for five months until no new seedlings emerged. A total of 3969 seedlings belonging to 71 species and 30 families germinated. The species composition of the seed bank was dominated by 53 herb species (75%) compared co 2 tree species which accounted for only 3 percent of the total number of species. Seedling density differed significantly among vegetation classes and ranged from 391 to 7807 seeds/m(2). Mean species richness also differed significantly among the vegetation classes. Forty-two species were found to be common to the seed banks and the standing vegetation; however, correspondence between species numbers and composition of che seed banks and the standing vegetation was poor. Although most of the species chat germinated in che seed banks were herbs and grasses, they can develop a vegetative cover and contribute to reduction of sail erosion. Regeneration of the cree species (some of which have seed viability up co four years) however, requires both time and the presence of mature individuals. Together with hillside closure and soil conservation measures (e.g., terracing), planting of native woody seedlings might help to expedite rehabilitation of degraded hillslopes devoid of trees and shrubs.

AB Forest succession on degraded tropical lands often is slowed by impoverished seed banks and low races of seed dispersal. Within degraded landscapes, remnant forests are potential seed sources that could enhance nearby forest succession. The spacial extent that forest can influence succession, however, remains largely unstudied. In abandoned agricultural Lands in Kibale National Park, Uganda, recurrent fires have helped perpetuate the dominance of tall (2-3 m) grasses. We examined the effects of distance from forest and grassland vegetation structure on succession in a grassland having several years of fire exclusion. At 10 and 25 m from forest edge, we quantified vegetation patterns, seed predation, and survival of planted tree seedlings. Natural vegetation was similar at both distances, as was seed (eight species) and seedling (six species) survival; however, distance may be important at spatial or temporal scales not examined in this study Our results offer insight into forest succession on degraded tropical grasslands following fire exclusion. Naturally recruited trees and tree seedlings were scarce, and seed survival was low (20% after 7 mo). While seedling survival was high (95% after 6 to 8 mo), seedling shoot growth was very slow ((x) over bar = 0.5 cm/100 d), suggesting that survivorship eventually may decline. Recurrent fires often impede forest succession in degraded tropical grasslands; however, even with fire exclusion, our study suggests that forest succession can be very slow, even in close proximity to forest.

AB For 26 tree species in very dry tropical Forest in Mexico, the developmental trends of relationships among trunk diameter, tree height, and crown diameter were inferred From a one-time measurement of dispersed individuals across the size range from saplings to large, mature trees. On hillside sites in this high diversity forest, maximum dimensions were usually <10-m height, 4-m crown diameter, and 0.3-m trunk diameter. The relationship of height re trunk diameter was characterized by an asymptotic, three-parameter model. Crown diameter was a linear function of trunk diameter. The parameter values for both models varied widely among the species. In general, the dispersion among species of the height-crown diameter relationship increased linearly with trunk diameter (up to 0.2 m). Arborescent cacti were distant From other species at all sizes, although they were well modeled using the same equations. Empirical and theoretical features and limitations of the present and previous models, including mechanical buckling and water-stress theories, are considered.

AB Canopy-top leaves of the dominant tree species from two 0.96-ha plots in Brunei, northern Borneo, were sampled for structural and chemical analysis. Thirteen species from the mixed dipterocarp forest at Andulau and 14 from the lowland heath forest at Badas were studied. The heath-forest: species had significantly thicker leaves and were lower in nitrogen and ash concentration than those from the mixed dipterocarp forest. There were no significant differences between the two species groups in leaf mass per unit area (LMA), leaf fracture toughness, carbon concentration, delta(13)C, neutral detergent fiber concentration, sclerophylly index, and stomatal density. A significant negative correlation between %C and delta(13)C found for the species from che mixed dipterocarp forest, but nor chose from the heath forest. The degree of sclerophylly measured in physical terms overlapped between che two sires to a considerable degree; however, all six species tested that were present in both plots had higher leaf fracture toughness in the heath forest. The possible reasons for the marked sclerophylly in the mixed dipterocarp forest are discussed.

ID NEOTROPICAL SAVANNA; TREES; COVER; FIRE
AB Due to frequent fire. low nutrient availability, and prolonged drought, tropical savanna is a stressful environment for the survival and growth of woody plant seedlings. To understand why forest species do not succeed in this environment while savanna species are able to persist, che effects of fire and woody cover on seedlings of these two functional groups were investigated in the Brazilian Cerrado. Seedlings were established in experimental plots under three densities of woody cover, in sites protected from fire and sires to be subjected to fire. There was a clear difference in the ability of savanna and forest species to survive fire. None of the three forest species were able to survive fire during the first two years of life, whereas eight of the nine savanna species were able to resprout following lire. The small seed size of the ninth savanna species, Miconia albicans. predisposed its seedlings to he sensitive to fire, because there was a strong positive correlation between seed size and survivorship. Savanna species were less dependent on woody cover than were forest species, which exhibited higher growth and survival under tree canopies than in open grassland. The low races of establishment and survival of forest trees in savanna, combined with high sensitivity to fire, appear sufficient to prevent the expansion of forest into savanna under current lire regimes in the Cerrado.

AB The Witheringia solanacea complex consists of three species, W. asterotricha. W. meiantha, and W. solanacea, native to Central and South America. The three taxa are morphologically similar, and their distinctions and relationships have been the subject of taxonomic controversy. To investigate breeding systems and potential For hybridization among the taxa of the complex, two Costa Rican accessions per species were used in a crossing program. All plants were self-incompatible except For one accession of W solanacea. Hybrid plants resulted from all crosses among accessions of W. asterotricha and W solanacea. Most crosses were unsuccessful using W. meiantha in combination with either of the other two taxa. It is suggested that W. meiantha and W. solanacea be recognized as separate taxa, but that W. asterotricha be considered a synonym of W. solanacea.

AB Isolating mechanisms are important in maintaining the taxonomic integrity of closely related sympatric taxa. A previous study found strong post-zygotic isolating barriers between two species, Witheringia asterotricha and W. meiantha, of the W. solanacea (Solanaceae) species complex in Costa pica. This study examines the presence of prezygotic barriers between the two species at La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica. Both species offer pollen and nectar as floral rewards and ale visited primarily by solitary or semi-social bees, some of which sonicate ("buzz") the anthers to discharge pollen. No evidence was found for phenological differences in flowering time between W. asterotricha and W. meiantha, bur pre-zygotic factors, such as ethological isolation and possibly fine-scale ecological or geographic barriers, may be responsible for restricting gene flow between the two species.

AB We recorded the times of flowering, fruiting, and leafing for ten native canopy and subcanopy trees and shrubs (monthly from December 1994 through December 1997) in a montane cloud forest with relatively aseasonal rainfall on the island of Maul, Hawaii. These species represented the great majority of individual woody plants at the sits. Flowers and fruits were available in the community year-round: however, all species exhibited annual patterns of flowering, and four species showed annual patterns of fruiting while the rest fruited in supra-annual patterns. Many species had protracted flowering or fruiting perks, and some bore small numbers of Rowers or fruit year-round. Most species Glowered in a monthly peak mainly between May and August, corresponding to the period of greatest solar irradiance and marginally higher temperatures. Fruit ripening followed at varying intervals. In contrast, the heaviest flowering occurred between November and March, resulting from bloom of the dominant tree, Metrosideros polymorpha. At the highest elevations, Metrosideros flowering was heaviest during September, but peak flowering of lower elevation trees occurred in late fall and winter. Two forms of this species differed in their temporal and spatial patterns of flowering. For M. polymorpha var. polymorpha and var. incana bloom peaked annually between November and January; however, For M. polymorpha var. glaberrima, flowering peaked from April through July, with an earlier secondary peak in January.

AB A survey of two Amazonian melastome ant-plants, Maieta guianensis and Tococa bullifera. revealed a significant difference in plant size according to the species of ant inhabiting the plant. Plants with Crematogaster laevis, on average, were smaller than those with Pheidole minutula (in M. guianensis) and those with Azteca sp. (in T. bullifera). There is no evidence that these patterns were due either to the deterministic replacement of C. laevis by another ant species during host-plant ontogeny or to a habitat effect on plant growth rates coupled with colony survival. More likely, the smaller size of C. laevis plants can he explained by its effects on host-plant performance. plants with C. laevis lost their associated ant colonies more frequently than plants with P. minutula and Azteca sp. Plants that lost their C. laevis either died, or more commonly, were severely defoliated. Defoliated plants, once sprouted, tended to become recolonized, hut such recolonizations were not deterministic so as to favor one species over another. Plants with C. laevis showed similar, or only slightly greater, standing levels of herbivory than plants with P. minutula or Azteca sp. This suggests that when C, laevis is present, it confers some degree of protection to its busts. It was found that early in colony development, queens of C. laevis moved off their host plants to build satellite nests in dead twigs on the ground, a behavior nor seen in the other two species and one that possibly renders colonies more vulnerable to mortality from predation, flooding, or nest decay. Comparable delta(15)N values in C laevis and P. minutula indicate that the two species are equally dependent on food supplied by the host plant.

AB During a five-year field study, we made observations and conducted experiments to demonstrate unequivocally that Euphyonarthex phyllostoma (Fulgoromorpha: Tettigometridae) is a myrmecophile. isolated adults and colonies always were found in association with ants. Colonies were associated only with Camponotus brutus or C. acvapimensis (Formicinae), whereas isolated adults were attended by ants belonging to several species of Formicinae, Dolichoderinae, and Myrmicinae. The size of the planthopper colonies reached higher levels when attended by C. brutus than by C acvapimensis. Experiments using ant exclusion showed that both ant species protected egg masses against parasitic wasps, but egg masses were less parasitized on trees occupied by C. brutus than on those occupied by C. acvapimensis (P = 0.0052). The production of egg masses by female hoppers was recorded only when C. brutus, C. aevapimensis, or the myrmicine ant Myrmicaria opaciventris attended the hopper. In both former cases, the presence of ants influenced the aggregation of the nymphs as they dispersed when ants were excluded. The aggregation of the nymphs ensured that they were properly attended. Parental care by the females was reduced tu their presence above ur close to the egg masses. in fact, specialized workers of the attending ant species protected the egg masses as well as nymphs.

AB The location of the nutrient-rich organic refuse produced by a leaf-cutting ant colony varies among ant species. Atta cephalotes locate their organic refuse in subterranean chambers, whereas A. colombica place their organic refuse on the soil surface near the nest. We studied the effect of the absence or presence of external organic refuse on the abundance of fine roots and seed bank composition in the superficial horizons of ant nests. We sampled soils from ant nests or dumps and adjacent areas of 15 adult nests of A. cephalotes at La Selva (LS), Costa Rice, and of 15 of A. colombica nests on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama. Soils from A. cephalotes nests did nor differ from adjacent soils in abundance of fine-root and seed diversity. In contrast, organic refuse from A. colombica nests was less diverse in seed composition (due to the great abundance of Miconia argentea) and had a greater abundance of fine roots than adjacent areas. Thus the external location of the ant-nest organic refuse is potentially important in determining the different types of plant recolonization in abandoned or dead ant nests. The relative abundance of these Atta species may influence the structure and/or composition of tropical forests.

AB I examined the face of seeds from ten focal trees of Afzelia quanzensis (Leguminosae), a canopy tree in the Arabuko-Sokoke, Kenya. The study was conducted for one fruiting season, between August 1990 and July 1991. Yellow baboons (Papio cynocephalus), Syke's monkeys (Cercopithercus albogularis), sun squirrels (Heliosciurus rufobrachium), and bush squirrels (Paraxerus palliatus) were all observed to interact with A. quanzensis seeds at various stages of pod development. Baboons and squirrels consumed high percentages of seeds when they were still immature, bur the seeds were still unavailable to Syke's monkeys at this stage. Baboons bit open the hard green pods and squirrels gnawed through the pods to extract the immature seeds (hereafter referred to as seed predation), but monkeys were unable to open the pods. Upon maturity the pods opened slightly revealing red arils that were sought by baboons, monkeys, and squirrels. Monkeys removed the highest percentage of mature seeds from these pods. These mammal dispersers ate the arils from the mature seeds and discarded the viable part that germinates (hereafter referred to as seed dispersal). My data indicate that baboons and squirrels are seed predators while monkeys are seed dispersers of A. quanzensis.

AB I examined the effects of two farm management variables, shade-tree species and crop structure, on the winter (dry season) arthropod and bird communities in a Jamaican shade coffee plantation. Birds and canopy arthropods were more abundant in areas of the plantation shaded by the tree Inga vera than by Pseudalbizia berteroana. The abundance of arthropods (potential pests) on the coffee crop, however, was unaffected by shade-tree species. Canopy arthropods, particularly psyllids (Homoptera), were especially abundant on Inga in late winter, when it was producing new leaves and nectar-rich flowers. Insectivorous and nectarivorous birds showed the strongest response to Inga; thus the concentration of birds in Inga may be a response to abundant food. Coffee-tree arthropod abundance was much lower than in the shade trees and was affected little by farm management variables, although arthropods tended to be more abundant in dense (unpruned) than open (recently pruned) areas of the plantation. Perhaps in response, leaf-gleaning insectivorous birds were more abundant in dense areas. These results underscore that although some shade coffee plantations may provide habitat for arthropod and bird communities, differences in farm management practices can significantly affect their abundances. Furthermore, this study provides evidence suggesting that bird communities in coffee respond to spacial variation in arthropod availability. I conclude that I. vera is a better shade tree than P. berteroana, bur a choice in crop structures is less clear due to changing effects of prune management over time.

AB The responses of small mammal communities to forest disturbance by logging were evaluated. The study area was located in the Imataca Forest Reserve (Venezuelan Guayana Region), where vegetation was predominantly lowland rain forest. Field analyses were based on a comparative inventory of species inhabiting primary forests and areas disturbed by selective logging. The taxonomic groups used as indicators of the ecological impact of logging belonged to thr orders Didelphimorphia, Chiroptera, and Rodentia (familia Sciuridae, Muridae, and Echimyidae). The following sampling methods were used: ii) mist nets; (2) traps in 2.4 ha grids teach with 120 stations: 60 at ground level and 60 in trees); and (3) diurnal and nocturnal sighs surveys. Total sampling effort consisted of 1904 net-hours, 10,320 trap-nights, and 567 h of direct observations. At least 83 mammalian species inhabited the evaluated forests (74.7 percent corresponding to Chiroptera), of which 15.3 percent: were restricted to primary forest. In logged areas, small mammal communities were characterized by: (1) higher abundances of individuals; (2) lower proportions of carnivorous and gleaning insectivorous bats; (3) increases in the relative abundance of frugivorous bat species that eat the fruits of colonizing plants; (4) higher proportions of aerial insectivores (Molossidae) at the lowest levels of the forest; (5) simplification in trophic structure of non-volant species, with semiarboreal predator-omnivores being the dominant guild (followed by terrestrial frugivore-omnivores); and (6) reduction in the relative abundance of mainly canopy-associated species. These results are explained by: ( 1) lower availability of key resources associated with primary forest (e.g., roosts in hollow trunks of mature trees, canopy fruits, and tree-crown continuity); (2) higher relative abundance of some food resources, such as terrestrial invertebrates and saprophytic plants, principally in areas where primary production is limited by low-fertility soils; (3) increase of roosting sites under fallen trunks: (4) modification of microclimatic conditions at the;understory level as a consequence of a greater incident sunlight after canopy opening; and (5) increase in density of early successional plants. The implications of these results to die conservation of biodiversity in forests managed for timber extraction in the Venezuelan Guayana Region are discussed.

AB Population density of Tapirus pinchaque was estimated in 7000 ha Parque Nacional Natural Los Nevados in the central Andes of Colombia. Eight variables were measured in 110 left rear foot prints of the mountain tapir: total length and width, and length and width of the three toes. This information was analyzed with Cluster Analysis by means of UPGMA. and Euclidean distance using the scores obtained by means of a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) using the right variables. Habitat availability was measured in 147,000 ha using aerial photographs taken during the 1950s and 1980s. The results of the cluster analysis showed that there are between 11 and 15 individuals, for a mean density of one individual for each 551 +/- 85 ha. The measurements of forest cover in the 147000 ha showed that habitat availability for the mountain tapir (montane forests and forestry plantations) increased 18141 ha from the 1950s to the 1980s. This increment in forest cover seems to have a positive effect on the local population size of T. pinchaque, since in areas previously covered by pastures, there are now secondary forests where tapir's tracks and feces can be found.

Of 20 species captured, 13 were shared between treatments, 4 were unique to continuous forest, and 3 were unique to forest fragments. Dominance-diversity curves were similar for the two treatments except that Sturnira lilium comprised 43 percent of captures in the forest fragments, resulting in greater dominance there. Capture rates land presumably relative abundance) differed significantly between continuous forest and forest fragments, both in terms of species and Feeding guilds, Sturnia lilium and Dermanura sp, were captured significantly more often in forest fragments than in continuous forest, whereas Artibeus jamaicensis, A. lituratus, and Centurio senex were taken significantly more often in continuous forest. Large frugivores accounted for a higher proportion of total captures in continuous forest than in forest fragments, whereas small frugivores showed the opposite pattern. By their abundances, Carollia perspicillata and S. lilium are indicators of forest disturbance. The relative abundances of large frugivores, which feed on large fruits of mature forest trees, and small frugivores, which feed on small-fruited plants occurring in early succession, are an indicator of forest disturbance. Other groups, such as large insect- and vertebrate-eating bats, because of their low capture rats, are impractical as indicators for rapid assessment of forest disturbance based on mist netting, but may prove especially vulnerable to forest fragmentation.

AB The year 2000 marks 500 years of massive destruction for the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, as a consequence of the European colonization of Brazil. Today, the Atlantic Forest is restricted to cut 98,800 km(2) of remnants, or 7.6 percent of its original extension. The Atlantic Forest continues to suffer under severe anthropogenic pressure, risking imminent extinction of the remaining species. Our current knowledge indicates that this complex biome contains a species diversity higher than most of the Amazon forests, and also has high levels of endemism. The 13 selected articles in this special issue present data on the natural history, ecology, sustainable management, and conservation of the Atlantic Forest. These articles represent a sample of the research conducted to date in the region and suggest avenues of future research, particularly with regard to conservation alternatives for the remaining portions of the Atlantic Forest. This special issue represents one of the first general references pertaining to the Brazilian Atlantic Forest.

AB The tree flora of southeastern Brazilian Atlantic forests was investigated according to two main aspects: (a) the variations in Aoristic composition of both rain and semi-deciduous forests were analyzed in terms of geographic and climatic variables by performing multivariate analyses on 125 existing Aoristic checklists; and (b) the links of both rain and semideciduous forests to Amazonian forests and Cerrados (woody savanna) were assessed. All analyses were performed at the species, genus, and family levels. The information obtained for the 125 forest areas was organized into an environmental database containing geographic and climatic records, and a floristic database containing binary presence records for 2532 species, 520 genera, and 106 families. Canonical correspondence analyses (CCA) were utilized to assess the relationship between geographic and climatic variables, and tree Bora composition. Venn diagrams and cluster analyses were used to assess the floristic links to Amazonian forests and Cerrados. The following patterns were detected at all three taxonomic levels: (a) the differentiation between rain and semi-deciduous forests is floristically consistent and strongly correlated with rainfall regime, although transitions may be abrupt to gradual; (b) a north-south differentiation exists for both rain and semi-deciduous forests, probably caused by variations in both temperature and rainfall regime; (c) The flora of semideciduous forests also changes with increasing distance from the ocean and the associated increasing rainfall seasonality; and (d) elevation and associated temperatures are strongly correlated with the internal differentiation of both rain and semi-deciduous forests. To a considerable extent, the tree flora of semi-deciduous forests is a subset of the rain forest Bora, probably extracting species that are able to cope with a longer dry season. There is greater Aoristic similarity at the species level between Atlantic rain and semi-deciduous forests than between any of these and either Amazonian rain forests or Cerrados. Nevertheless, semi-deciduous forests and Cerrados show stronger links, particularly at the generic and familial levels. Therefore, there is little Aoristic ground for viewing Atlantic rain forests as being closer to their Amazonian counterparts than to the adjacent semi-deciduous forests. The most appropriate view of rain and semideciduous forests in southeastern Brazil is that of a continuum in tree species distribution. We suggest that the definition of Atlantic forests should be as comprehensive as that of Amazonian forests.

AB This paper describes the phenology of leaf, flower, and fruit phenology in the Atlantic rain forests of southeastern Brazil. For 17 months, we observed the phenological patterns of trees from two Atlantic forest types at four sites: premontane forest (Sites I and IV; the "typical" Atlantic rain forest) and coastal plain forest (Sites II and III). All sites experience a nonseasonal, tropical wet climate, characterized by an annual rainfall usually > 2000 mm and lacking a dry season. We tested for the occurrence (or absence) of seasonal phenological patterns within each site and compared the patterns detected among the four different forest sites using circular statistics. The expected weakly seasonal phenological patterns were not observed for these forests. Flowering and leaf flush patterns of Atlantic rain forest trees were significantly seasonal, concentrated at the beginning of the wettest season, and were significantly correlated with day length and temperature. These results stress the influence that seasonal variation in day length has on ever-wet forest tree phenology. Fruiting phenologies were aseasonal in all four forests. Flowering patterns did not differ significantly among three of the four forest sites analyzed, suggesting the occurrence of a general flowering pattern for Atlantic rain forest trees.

AB We studied 86 species of hummingbird-pollinated flowers and their pollinators at a coastal lowland site and two highland rain forest sites in southeastern Brazil. The Jaccard index for hummingbird-pollinated floras showed greater floristic similarity between the two highland communities than between floras of high altitudes and that of near sea level. The lowland site had slightly greater richness than either of the two highland sites. Bromeliaceae was the most important family, accounting for ca 36 percent of the bird-pollinated species and comprising 33 percent of the richest flowers. The plant populations bloomed annually for the most part. Both the wet lowland and the dry highland Boras showed flowering seasonality, whereas the cloud highland flora had aseasonal flowering. A hermit hummingbird was the major pollinator in the lowland community. A hermit and a non-hermit hummingbird shared most of the floral resources in the two highland communities. Hermit hummingbirds are the major pollinators of hummingbird-pollinated floras in the Atlantic rain forests of southeastern Brazil. These areas may be as rich as Central and other South American areas in hummingbird-pollinated flowers, and altogether present an older development history when compared to the North American flora.

AB Toucans are prominent components of the tropical American avifauna. Although these birds are very conspicuous, there are few ecological studies focusing on them. In this study, the diets of four sympatric toucans (Ramphastos vitellinus, R. dirolorus, Selenidera maculirostris, and Baillonius bailloni were assessed by recording feeding bouts at two altitudes in the Atlantic Forest of southeast Brazil. Our results show that toucans are predominantly frugivorous birds (96.5% of the 289 feeding bouts were on fruits). In the lowlands (70 m elev.), only fruits (48 species, 27 families) were recorded, while in the highlands (700 m elev.), toucans were observed feeding on fruits (25 species, 22 families), flowers, leaves, and insects. Non-fruit items were recorded only in the highlands, most of them eaten by B. bailloni. Cecropia glaziovii and Euterpe edulis, two abundant plants in the highland and lowland sites, respectively, and Virola oleifera, a plane that produces lipid-rich arillate fruits, were eaten heavily by the toucans. The number of feeding bouts recorded for R. vitellinus in the lowlands was positively correlated with lipid content of the fruits eaten. The diameters of fruits eaten by toucans varied greatly (range = 0.4-25.0 mm). While the large Ramphastos species not only ate tiny fruits (e.g., Hyeronima alchorneoides) but also large ones (e.g., Virola gardneri), the toucanets ate piecemeal the large fruits chat exceeded their gape width, suggesting that gape size did not limit the use of any fruit by the toucans at our study sites.

AB Given the abundance of litter-foraging ants and fallen fleshy diaspores on the door of tropical forests, interactions involving them should be common and may render important consequences fur the biology of the diaspores. In this study we surveyed the interactions between ants and non-myrmecochorous diaspores along a 5-km transect in a lowland Atlantic rain forest of southeast Brazil. A diaspore is defined as any seed, fruit, or infructescence that constitutes the unit of dispersal of the plant. During two years of monthly samplings of naturally fallen diaspores, 886 ant-diaspore interactions involving 36 ant species and 56 different species of diaspores (range = 0.05-29.5 g) were recorded. The number of interactions was significantly and positively correlated with rainfall but not with mean temperature. The number of ant species recorded in the interactions was positively associated with both rainfall and temperature. Lipid-rich diaspores attracted a larger ant assemblage than those with lower contents of lipids. The seasonal pattern for ant-diaspore interactions in the Atlantic rain forest is predicted by well known seasonal patterns in ant activity and diaspore production. Other factors that also may affect the observed pattern are the massive and episodic fruiting of some plant species in which diaspores are especially attractive to ants, and a preference for lipid-rich arillate seeds. Interactions between ants and fallen non-myrmecochorous diaspores may be especially common in lowland rain forests in which the abundance of ants is coupled with the year-round availability of fleshy diaspores.

The reproductive mode of H. leucopygia is defined as follows: aquatic eggs and embryos in subterranean constructed nests; subsequent to flooding, feeding tadpoles in ponds or streams. We suggest that the new reproductive mode is widespread among the species in the H. albosignata group. The specialized courtship behaviors of H. leucopygia, characterized by vocalizations and a stereotyped sequence of mutual touches between male and female, are described. A review of the reproductive modes of hylid frogs is provided, with 11 modes recognized for the Atlantic Forest hylids and 12 modes For hylids around the world.

We utilized distribution data available for species of marsupials, rodents, and primates char occur in South America. Two grids were superimposed on the distribution maps: a larger one encompassing tropical and subtropical South America, and a smaller and more precise grid covering the Atlantic Forest only. Also, the number of species per quadrat was estimated. The results support the idea that the distribution of this fauna is structured in the form of centers of endemism. In addition, there is good congruence between the areas identified here and those proposed by other authors, reinforcing the value of PAE in this kind of analysis. The hierarchical relationships among areas, however, are not clear and sometimes discordant with other biogeographic analyses.

AB Euterpe edulis (Martius) is a single-stemmed, abundant Neotropical palm of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest (Mata Atlantica). The species produces the heart of palm, locally called palmito, which is an important source of income For forest owners. Because of its high market value, its short-term demands of the forest environment, and its important interactions with animal species, this palm is suitable for sustainable management and conservation purposes. In this paper, we present the results from a 15-year investigation of this species, synthesizing results on its demography, seed dispersion, reproductive biology, genetics, and economics. We have linked these results in a proposal for the species' sustainable management and conservation.

AB Muriquis (Brachyteles arachnoides) are endemic to the Atlantic Forest of southeastern Brazil, where an estimated 1200 individuals are distributed unevenly among only 19 populations. Despite the fact that over two-thirds of all muriquis live at low densities in large and protected, undisturbed forests, virtually nothing is known about the demography of these populations. Consideration of the mechanisms underlying the low extinction probabilities simulated for muriquis inhabiting the small, disturbed forest at the Estacao Biologica de Caratinga (EBC), Minas Gerais, where long-term demographic and behavioral studies have been conducted, provides disturbing predictions about the viability of other populations living at lower densities. Local resource competition may be responsible for the female-biased infant sex ratio documented at the EBC under the Female-biased dispersal regime exhibited by muriquis. At lower population densities, however, release from competition may lead to male-biased infant sex ratios, and correspondingly slower population growth rates. High densities at the EBC also result in frequent intergroup encounters, permitting muriquis there to avoid close inbreeding through extra-group copulations; but at low densities, opportunities to avoid inbreeding may be more limited. Finally, habitat heterogeneity at the EBC, particularly the greater dietary diversity supported by secondary and regenerating vegetation in disturbed forests, not only may support higher muriqui densities but also provide greater dietary buffers against catastrophic fruit scarcities compared to undisturbed forests. Comparative demographic data on muriqui populations inhabiting undisturbed forests are critically needed to evaluate these predictions and to develop informed management plans for this endangered primate.

Based on captures with mist nets, 75 bird species belonging to 15 families were inventoried; however the species composition varied greatly among the study areas. Fifty species and 231 of the 466 individuals recorded during this study were captured at NE. In the AD area, 33 species and 132 individuals were captured. The other two areas, BSC and RDSP contributed only 103 captures and 22 species. By analyzing species composition as a function of altitude of the study areas, it was verified that a variation of 500 m altitude was sufficient in determining the difference in existing bird communities. Formicariidae species, such as Drymophilia squamata, Thamnophilus punctatus, and Conopophaga melanops. were captured exclusively in the BSC and RDSP areas, located below the 500 m altitude limit while their congeners (D. orhropyga, T. caerulescens, and C. lineata) were found exclusively in the highest areas (NE and AD). Significant seasonal variations in the species composition were observed (Green's test: Q = 12.79 in NE, 12.84 in AD, 12.4 in BSC, and 20.68 in RDSP; P < 0.05), and we believe that such variations could be associated with seasonal movements between the highest and lowest areas of the Rio Duce basin. As such, the impacts of fragmentation to the Atlantic Forest along this stretch of the Rio Doce basin may have affected the natural dynamics of avian movements. The destruction of > 30 percent of the original Atlantic Forest vegetation cover already may have seriously compromised the population viabilities of birds endemic to this area.

AB Forest structure and tree species composition were studied in four Atlantic seasonal forest fragments ranging from 0.7 to 220 ha, isolated for more than a century in southeastern Brazil. Four physiognomic units were recognized within these fragments: (1) low forest, (2) bamboo forest, (3) high forest, and (4) mature forest. Tree density, basal area, and species diversity (Shannon-Wiener index) increased from low forest to bamboo forest to high forest to mature forest. Liana cover was highest in low forest. Gap-opportunistic species were the dominant ecological group in low forest, bamboo forest, and high forest, while shade tolerant canopy species formed the dominant group in mature forest. These structural and compositional features formed a gradient of forest development from the least developed low and bamboo forests to the most developed mature forest. Low forest is hypothesized to be in a stage of arrested succession and high forest a stage of degraded forest. A conceptual model is suggested to explain how these physiognomic units may be related to one another. Although these fragments were covered mainly by high and low forests and thus had a degraded structure, species diversity remained high in all of them. Fragments thus may undergo degradation long after isolation, even when they have been protected from human disturbance for a considerable period. Nonetheless, they also preserve important samples of local and regional floristic diversity for a long time after isolation.

ID SPECIES RICHNESS; ASSEMBLAGES
AB The Atlantic Forest region (wide sense) includes very complex tropical environments, increasingly threatened by extensive anthropogenic conversion (> 30%). Ecologically specialized, short-generation insects (butterflies) are evaluated here as indicators for monitoring community richness, landscape integrity, and sustainable resource use in the region. The > 2100 butterfly species in the Atlantic Forest region have been censused in many sites over 35 years, giving comparable daily, weekly, monthly, and long-term site lists. The 21 most thoroughly studied sites include 218-914 species, of which half can be censused in a week or less. The butterfly communities are divided into six relatively distinct faunal regions, centered in the northeast, the central coastal tablelands, the southeast coastal plain, the mountains plus interior of the southeastern states, the central plateau, and the southern states. Species richness shows the highest values in coastal mountains from 15 to 23 degreesS. Local butterfly communities show a high turnover, with 20 to 40 percent of the species, especially small Lycaenidae and Hesperiidae, recorded only as unstable populations or "tourists." Easily sampled species in the family Nymphalidae, and especially its bait-attracted subfamilies, are best correlated with the entrire butterfly fauna and can be used as surrogates for species diversity In most butterfly groups, species richness is well predicted by landscape connectivity alone, or by composite indices of environmental heterogeneity, natural disturbance, and (negatively) anthropogenic disturbance. Principal components and redundancy analyses showed that the richness and proportions of different butterfly groups in the local fauna are variably explained by disturbance, seasonality, temperature, vegetation, soils, and landscape connectivity. Various groups thus can be used as rapid indicators of different types of change in the community, its environment, and the landscape. Threatened and rare species also can be used as indicators of the most unique Atlantic Forest communities (paleoenvironments), which need special attention.

AB We compared early plant succession in four abandoned pastures of differing age since abandonment and a nearby secondary forest site in northwestern Ecuador. Two "Open" pastures had no tree canopy covering, and two "Guava: pastures had a well-developed canopy cover of Psidium guajava. No sire had been seeded with pasture grasses. All pastures were compared in a chronological sequence; two were monitored For 18 months. Species richness was consistently higher in Guava sites than in Open sites and it continued to increase over time, whereas it remained static in Open sites. Species richness was highest in secondary Forest. Recruitment of tree saplings in Guava: sites was lower than in secondary forest; however, it was nearly absent in Open sires. The seed bank contained predominantly herbaceous species ar all sites, and was highly dissimilar to aboveground vegetation. Dominance-diversity curves for Guava sires showed a more equitable distribution of species thar increased over time. In contrast, dominance-diversity curves for Open sires were static and indicated dominance by a few aggressive species. Soil characteristics among sites were variable; however, a principal components analysis on soils isolated the older Open site from all others. The older Open site had the lowest species richness and was dominated by Baccharis trinervis, an aggressive shrub species. The site appears re be in a state of arrested succession and some form of restorative intervention may be necessary to initiate succession coward a forested condition. Succession in Guava sites appears headed toward secondary forest, whereas it does nor in Open sites.

AB A total of 217 species of typically foliicolous lichens were found at the "Botarrama" trail, a premontane rain forest in the Braulio Carrillo National Park, Costa Rica. The species composition confirmed the classification of this study sire as transitional between lowland wet and montane rain forest. In terms of species richness, the foliicolous lichen Bora was dominated by the families Gomphillaceae (Calenia, Echinoplaca, Gyalideopsis, and Tricharia), Trichotheliaceae (Porina and Trichothelium), and Pilocarpaceae (Byssoloma and Fellhanera). The most frequent species were Porina mirabilis (including its supposed anamorph Phyllophiale alba), Gyalectidium filicinum, Porina rufula, and Strigula platypoda. A large proportion of the species was rare. Frequency distributions based on area cover corresponded well to general community models by closely fitting a log-normal approximation. Half of the species had narrow ecological amplitudes while more than 70 percent exhibited a wide geographical distribution, thus making the study sire representative of a Neotropical rain forest. The use of foliicolous lichens as indicators of altitudinal zonation is discussed.

Debate surrounds the issue whether R. taedigera swamps are early successional stages or mature "climax" communities. This paleoecological analysis of a 1.46-m sediment core from swamps on the Caribbean coast of Nicaragua establishes the abundant presence of R, taedigera swamps for ae least 2800 +/- 90 years. R. taedigera swamps must be considered persistent communities, warranting further study because of their great extension into Central and South America.

AB Shade-tolerant understory shrubs and subcanopy trees constitute most of the woody species in Neotropical moist forest, bur studies demonstrating physiological differences among these species are few. Shade-tolerant species that coexist in the forest understory exhibit differences in leaf life span that have been associated with variation in physiological traits. We hypothesized that water relations of understory species with widely divergent leaf life spans differ in response to drought. Although severe drought is infrequent in Neotropical moist Forest, we studied the water relations of shade-tolerant understory species with short or long leaf life spans during the severe 1981-1992 dry season on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. The predawn leaf water potential declined to -2.8 and -3.6 MPa during the dry season in Hybanthus prunifolius and Psychotria horizontalis, respectively two species with shore leaf life spans, but remained above -1.3 MPa in two species with long leaf life spans, Swartzia simplex and Ouratea lucens. The midday leaf water potential dropped as low as -3.4 and -4.5 MPa for H. prunifolius and P. horizontalis, respectively. The osmotic potential of H. prunifolius and P. horizontalis and another species with short leaf life span, Alseis blackiana, decreased early in the dry season, a period during which all three had substantially negative predawn water potential. In contrast, the osmotic potential of S. Simplex, O. Lucens, and Licania platypus, a third species with long leaf life span, declined late in the dry season, even though we observed little change in predawn water potential for S, simplex and O. lucens. We conclude that the variable and potentially severe dry season in Neotropical moist forest can be sufficiently intense to severely limit soil moisture availability for understory planes. H. prunifolius and P horizontalis tolerated dehydration, whereas S. simplex and O. lucens postponed dehydration.

AB Syzygium nervosum is a common monsoon rain forest tree. Its habitat in Australia consists of small rain forest patches chat are scattered through a savanna matrix. It is a mast flowering canopy species that produces large quantities of fruits fed on by mobile frugivores such as birds and fruit bats. The genetic diversity of this species was investigated, especially in relation to rain forest patch size, geographic isolation, and geographic distribution. Syzygium nervosum was found to have high levels of genetic diversity within populations (H-e = 0.307). Diversity among populations, however, was relatively low (F-ST = 0.118), and was not spatially structured across its geographic range in Australia. This is thought to have been caused by relatively frequent gene flow among populations (N-m = 1.67), mediated primarily by mobile frugivores. Genetic diversity was not correlated with patch size or isolation. It is thought that seed dispersal by frugivores has acted to expand the effective population size of this species beyond the individual rain forest parch, and thus has prevented the substantial loss of genetic diversity that otherwise would have been observed. Thus this species is dependent upon these frugivores for the maintenance of its generic diversity and hence its longterm viability. These results lend support to theories of post-Holocene expansion of rain forest by vagile species in northern Australia.

AB Dalbergia miscolobium (Papilionaceae) is a tree of the Brazilian cerrado that produces ovaries with two ovules. Only one ovule usually matures, but when two mature, they are smaller than seeds of single-seeded pods. Germination percentage was lower in small seeds than in medium or large seeds. In general, small seeds gave rise to smaller seedlings (dry mass) than did medium and large seeds. The root/shoot ratio, however, was very similar for the first six months, indicating that this ratio is consistent across seedling sizes. There was no correlation between seed size and relative growth rare. Single-seeded fruit production in D. miscolobium resulted in great er seed reserves and increased fruit dispersal distance; single-seeded fruits were lighter than double-seeded ones. Together, these two features should increase the probability of successful seedling establishment of seeds from single-seeded versus double-seeded fruits.

AB We assessed the effects of litter cover on herbivory and performance (annual survival and relative growth rate in height and leaf number) for established seedlings (greater than or equal to 9 cm tall, and greater than or equal to 4 mo old), of four shade-tolerant, large-seeded, co-occurring Sapotaceae species. Seedlings were divided into three liner treatments: (1) litter addition, (2) control, and (3) continuous liner removal. The mean survival For all treatments in descending order were: Chrysophyllum pomiferum (83%), Pouteria peruviensis (84%), P. caimito (75%), and Micropholis venulosa (40%). For all variables, species differed significantly within litter treatments. In M. venulosa, survival and relative growth rare in leaf number significantly decreased with the removal of litter, whereas herbivory increased. Relative growth rate in height: of P. peruviensis decreased significantly with litter removal, while the levels of herbivory were higher with the addition of litter. Conversely litter quantity had no effect on the performance of C. pomiferum but herbivory was lower in the removal treatment. Finally in P. caimito, litter treatment did not affect performance or herbivory. Results suggest that differences in litter quantity differentially affect tree species with similar biology (i.e., large-seeds, shade tolerance) in life stages other than germination and early establishment. The variability in species' responses to litter might be an important factor in determining species richness, abundance, and distribution of tropical rain forest tree species at the seedling level.

AB We investigated the role of wood-boring insects in the creation of light gaps within mangrove forests. We compared the frequency of gaps caused by wood borers to other gap-forming processes and characterized the physical attributes of light gaps in mangrove forests on small islands in Belize. Methods of quantifying light gaps included aerial photography, ground surveys, and experimental plots. Small light gaps (less than or equal to 12 m(2)) were very common in Rhizophora mangle fringe, comprising almost: 22 percent of these forests. Rhizophora mangle gaps were smaller than gaps in Avicennia germinans forests. In R, mangle forests, gaps were caused by branch death, and in R germinans forests, gaps were caused primarily by downed trees. More than 91 percent of the gap-forming branches and boles in the R. mangle fringe were killed by a wood-boring cerambycid beetle, Elaphidion mimeticum, indicating that it is the major cause of small-scale disturbances in these forests. No trees or branches in the A. germinans forest were attacked by this beetle. In R. mangle forests, small gaps had significantly higher light levels and soil temperatures than areas under the closed canopy; however, soil conditions for sulfide concentrations, porewater salinity and redox potentials were similar in small gaps and under the closed canopy. Survival of R. mangle, A. germinans, and Laguncularia racemosa seedlings was also higher inside these small gaps, indicating their importance in regeneration of mangrove forests. Feeding by wood borers is thus an important type of indirect herbivory in mangrove forests, with a critical role in ecological processes such as gap dynamics.

AB The floral syndrome of Macleania bullata Yeo (Ericaceae) reflects its adaptation to hummingbird pollination. Its flowers, however, are subject to high levels of nectar robbing. I examined the floral visitor assemblage of M. bullata in a tropical montane wet forest in southwestern Colombia, focusing on the behavior of the visitors. I also rested far the presence of nocturnal pollination and the effects of nectar removal on new nectar production. The principal floral visitors were the nectar robbing hummingbirds Ocreatus underwoodii (19.1% of visits) and Chlorostilbon mellisugus (18.9%). Only two species of long-billed hummingbirds visited the Bowers of M. bullata as "legitimate" pollinators: Coeligena torquata (14.7% of visits) and Doryfera ludoviciae (14.3%). The remaining visits constituted nectar robbing by bees, butterflies, and other species of hummingbirds. Nocturnal pollination took place, although fruit set levels were 2.4 rimes higher when only diurnal pollination was allowed as opposed to exclusively nocturnal pollination. Nectar robbers removed floral nectar without pollinating the flower. Treatments of experimental nectar removal were carried out to examine if flowers synthesize more nectar after nectar removal. Nectar removal increased the total volume of nectar produced by each Bower without affecting sugar concentration. Thus, nectar robbing can impose a high cost to the plants by forcing them to replace lost nectar.

AB Interspecific and interannual variation in reproductive phenology was quantified for 50 common species of trees and shrubs from a mesic savanna near Darwin, northern Australia. The presence of buds, Bowers, and fruit was noted over a 30-month period, from September 1992 to February 1995. Surveys were undertaken at: monthly intervals for the less common species, and at bimonthly intervals for ten of the common trees and tall shrubs. The majority of species flowered each year at about the same time. There was no evidence of sub-annual or continuous regimes of reproductive phenology. There was no supra-annual carryover of seed-bearing fruit in the canopy of any species. The peak flowering periods were the mid to late dry season (July-August) and the transition between the dry season and the wet season (October-November). The two dominant trees--Eucalyptus miniata and E. tetrodonta--flowered during the dry season, thereby providing resources for some elements of the vertebrate Fauna. Flowering and fruiting were uncommon at the end of the wet season (February/March), although two species that flower and fruit ar this time (E. porrecta and Terminalia ferdinandiana) may provide resources to consumers at a time when floral or fruit resources are otherwise scarce. Because the peak of reproductive activity takes place during the late dry season, fruit maturity and seed dispersal have occurred prior to the onset of the rainy season for most species, and germination and seedling establishment potentially may take effect in response to the first rains. Late dry season fires, which tend to be extensive and incense, are a potential threat to the floral and fruit reserves within these savannas.

AB The reproductive ecology of nine hermaphroditic understory species in a tropical montane Quercus forest was studied at two sites (2300 and 2600 m elev.) in the Cordillera de Talamanca, Costa Rica. Flower life span, studied in six species, averaged 4.4 d. This is longer than flower life spans found in the Monteverde cloud forest (2.7 d) and comparable co flower life spans found for arctic and alpine species. We studied the breeding system in five species and found no self-incompatible species. Four species proved self-compatible, and three: of these showed autogamy. The main diurnal insect pollinator was the bumblebee Bombus ephippiatus. Natural fruit set was low (8-32%) in six species with few seeds per fruit, while two many-seeded species showed a high rare of fruit set (90 and 96%). The incidence of pre-dispersal seed predation was high; the percentage of seeds infested in four species ranged from 8 to 56 percent.

AB Dry forests in middle Cauca River valley (southwest Colombia) almost have been eliminated from the region and the las; remnants are seriously threatened. This study shows the biological value of seven forest fragments, comparing their ant diversity with that of their surrounding matrices. Two intensive ant surveys were made in each Forest Fragment and irs matric between August 1994 and February 1995. Sampling effort was the same in each of the seven sites. We Found that: (1) forest Fragments are richer and more diverse than their respective matrices; (2) forests preserve a larger number of rare ant species than the matrices; and (3) the richer the forest, the larger the number of exclusive ant species it preserves. Therefore, these forests must be presented to maintain regional biodiversity.

AB Seed dispersal by Salvin's curassows (Mitu salvini) was studied in a lowland tropical forest at La Macarena on the border of the Macarena and Tinigua National Parks, the Department of Meta, Colombia. Continuous observations were made on the Feeding and ranging behavior of a well-habituated pair of birds from 0600 to 1800 h for 19 days. Total observation time was 222 h. The daily distance traveled by the birds ranged from 630 to 3750 m, with a mean of 1953 m (+/- 776 m). The total home range was cn 34.4 ha. Although curassows were observed consuming Fruits of 13 species belonging to the Families Rubiaceae, Meliaceae, Moraceae, Burseraceae, Leguminosae, and Lecythidaceae, only seeds of Geophila repens (Rubiaceae) and Ficus. sphenophylla (Morceae) were found in their Feces. For G. repens, the mean and maximum retention times were 1 h 52 min (+/- 1 h 20 min) and 6 h 08 min, and the mean and maximum direct dispersal distances were 245 m (+/- 164 m) and 633 m. More than half the seeds were dispersed in canopy gaps. For F. sphenophylla, the mean and maximum retention rimes were 3 h 15 min (+/- 37 min) and 7 h 08 min, and the mean and maximum direct dispersal distances were 329 m (+/- 46 m) and 451 m. Nearly GO percent of the estimated seed intake of G. repens and 92-94 percent of F sphenophylla were digested or damaged. The retention times and the dispersal distances for Stretoptogyna americana, which has adhesive burrs, were also measured. The mean and maximum retention times were 1 h 55 min (+/- 1 h 56 min) and 9 h 11 min, and the mean and maximum direct dispersal distances were 128 m (+/- 68 m) and 280 m. This is the first study in which direct measurements were made For retention times and dispersal distances of the epizoochory and endozoochory for birds in the field.

AB The behavior and physiology of two parapatric sibling species, Heliconius erato cyrbia Godt. and H. himera Hew., were investigated to assess if environmental adaptation enabled stable morphological, generic, and ecological differences to exist in the face of hybridization. Morning and evening activity, egg production, and Larval development time of H. himera and H. erato in insectaries were recorded; individuals were collected in allopatry and in sympatry from a hybrid zone in which the species overlapped. Studies were performed at ambient conditions within the natural range of H; himera. H. himera was considerably more active than H. erato, flying earlier in the morning and later in the evening, even when both species were collected in sympatry. Similarly, H. himera laid more eggs, and the hatched larvae developed more rapidly The results suggest that physiological constraints are an important selective force that may have been important in speciation and counteracts hybridization in the maintenance of the H. himera/H. erato contact zone. Ecological selection, arising from adaptation to low temperatures, may help explain the competitive exclusion of H. erato by H. himera in the drier, cooler montane habitat favored by the latter species.

AB We sampled litter frogs in an 1800-ha mid-elevation seasonal forest in southeast ern Brazil. One hundred 8 x 8-m plots were sampled during the dry/cold season and wet/warm season (unburned areas); we also examined the effects of fire in recently burned areas. A total of 267 frogs (305 g), belonging to 16 species (4 families) were caught. A single species comprised 78.5 percent of the individuals in the dry/cold season and 54.3 percent in the wet/warm season. The density of individuals did not change significantly with season, biomass did. Density and biomass of frogs were positively correlated with altitude. A Mantel test indicated chat biological data (species and their abundance) were significantly associated with environmental parameters. The burned areas showed low values in richness, density and biomass of frogs. Harsh seasonal climate and a history of human disturbance may produce the low observed diversity values. The greater densities of frogs in sites of higher elevation may primarily result from mist-generated humidity, which diminishes the harshness of the dry/cold season in relation to lower sites.

AB Field studies of elusive mammals such as Agouti para are difficult, and results are often biased and incomplete because the animals are nocturnal and avoid traps. By studying an A. paca population in a Pacific lowland forest of Costa Rica, we developed indirect observational methods to estimate population density and food resource utilization. To estimate population density we divided the number of A, paca burrows found in a 12-ha census area by the average number of burrows utilized per individual from radiotelemetry data. We compared this estimate to independent population estimates obtained using two transect methods. Agouti paca density was estimated at 93 individuals/km(2) based on burrow number, and between 67 to 70 individuals/km(2) using transect methods. This discrepancy corroborates previous studies suggesting that transect methods underestimate population density. To identify food resources consumed by the species, we collected fruits and seeds with unambiguous A. paca teeth marks. The only animal in Central America with an incisor width similar to A. paca is Dasyprocta variegata; in a comparison of both species, however, we found that A. para had a significantly larger incisor width and that teeth marks of 4 mm or wider unambiguously indicated handling by this species. By applying this technique, food resources utilized by A. paca can be identified more easily than by direct observation. Al our study site, we identified 33 plant species consumed by A. paca; 61 percent are new records for this animal. Our results suggest that A. para plays a major, although not fully understood, ecological role in seed predation and dispersal.

AB During the filling of the Petit Saut dam in French Guiana, a wildlife rescue operation was conducted for 17 months. Over 900 sloths (Bradypus tridactylus and Choloepus didactylus) were captured along the Sinnamary River in a primary rain forest that was largely undisturbed at the outset Raw densities of 1.7 B. tridactylus/km(2) and 0.9 C. didactylus/km(2) were estimated. The distribution of captures was relatively continuous for both species along the rivers; variations mon likely reflected biases due to capture methods. The highest densities of captures were located mainly in marshy areas. During the first months, due to different probabilities of sighting the two species, B, tridactylus captures predominated; however, as defoliation advanced, captures of C. didactylus reached the same level. In both species, over 73 percent of individuals captured were solitary and another 23-24 percent were females carrying young, accounting for 96 percent of emancipated individuals.

AB Litter disappearance was examined before (1989) and after (1990) Hurricane Hugo in the Luquillo Experimental Forest, Puerto Rico using mesh litterbags containing abscised Cyrilla racemiflora or Dacryodes excelsa leaves or fresh Prestoea montana leaves. Biomass and nitrogen dynamics were compared among: (i) species; (ii) mid- and high elevation forest types; (iii) riparian and upland sites; and (iv) pre- and post-hurricane disturbed environments. Biomass disappearance was compared using multiple regression and negative exponential models in which the slopes were estimates of the decomposition races subsequent to apparent leaching losses and the y-intercepts were indices of initial mass losses (leaching). Cyrilla racemiflora leaves with low nitrogen (0.33%) and high lignin (22.1%) content decayed at a low rate and immobilized available nitrogen. Dacryodes excelsa leaves had moderate nitrogen (0.67%) and lignin (16.6%) content, decayed at moderate rates, and maintained the initial nitrogen mass. Prestoea montana foliage had high nitrogen (1.76%) and moderate lignin (16.7%) content and rapidly lost both mass and nitrogen. There were no significant differences in litter disappearance and nitrogen dynamics among forest types and slope positions. Initial mass loss of C. racemiflora leaves was lower in 1990 bur the subsequent decomposition rate did nor change. Initial mass losses and the overall decomposition rates were lower in 1990 than in 1989 for Dacryodes excelsa. Dacryodes excelsa and C. racemiflora litter immobilized nitrogen in 1990 bur released 10-15 percent of their initial nitrogen in 1989, whereas P. montana released nitrogen in both years (25-40%). Observed differences in litter disappearance races between years may have been due to differences in the timing of precipitation. Foliar litter inputs during post-hurricane recovery of vegetation in Puerto Rico may serve to immobilize and conserve site nitrogen.

AB Nodding capitula are a striking feature in several Asteraceae species of the Andean superparamo. In this study the thermal environment of the nodding inflorescence in Culcitium canescens Humb. & Bonpl. was surveyed by a shortterm microclimatic measurement. Temperatures of the nodding inflorescences were higher than temperatures of the surrounding air during the day, while the respective temperatures were comparable during the night. Also, compared to other parts of the plant, the nodding inflorescence provided favorable temperature conditions. An experiment showed that the radiation reflected from the substratum explained most of the variability in the inflorescence temperature. It is suggested that the nodding capitula have evolved to protect the flowers from snow and rain while at the same time ensuring sufficient temperatures for floral development.

AB Plants that hyperaccumulate Ni contain > 1000 ppm (dry wt.) in their tissues. Variation of Ni content within hyperaccumulating plant species is poorly explored. Using the Ni-hyperaccumulating shrub Psychotria douarrei, we documented variation of leaf Ni levels within individual shrubs, and variation with respect to plant size and leaf age. Plant. size did not correlate significantly with leaf Ni content, and leaf Ni content did not correlate significantly with soil Ni content. Older leaves contained twice as much Ni as younger leaves. Older leaves also contained greater concentrations of Ca, Fe, and Cr bur less K, P, and Cu. Five elements (Zn, Pb, Co, Mn, Mg) showed no significant variation due to leaf age. We also examined the effect of leaf age on epiphyll cover, finding increased epiphyll cover on the upper surface of older leaves. The dominant leafy liverwort epiphyll had a relatively high Ni content (400 ppm), suggesting that epiphylls of Ni hyperaccumulators obtain some Ni from host leaves. Individual shrubs differed in mean leaf Ni content almost two-fold (14,900-27,700 ppm). Variation among branches within individuals also ranged widely; however, this intraplant variability was not strongly correlated with the mean leaf Ni content of an individual shrub. We concluded that Ni contents in leaves of I? douarrei vary considerably due to leaf age, among individual shrubs, and among branches within a shrub.

AB The nutrient status of Lake Naivasha, a freshwater lake in southeastern Kenya, has been rising since at lease 1982. A potential effect of increases in nutrient supply to the lake's floating papyrus is increasing of the plants' investment in above-water material and reduction of the amount of energy invested in uptake and storage. Biomass and its allocation between culms, panicles, roots, and rhizomes was measured in 17 sites around the 150-km(2) lake. Although above-water biomass was greatest in sites closest to the lake's major nutrient inflow the River Malewa, there was little evidence of corresponding decreases in the biomass of uptake and storage tissues. In August 1995, the average +/- SD biomass of papyrus in the lake was 11,540 +/- 3020 g/m(2), with the papyrus containing about 4500 +/- 1900 g total carbon/m(2) and about 100 +/- 70 g coral nitrogen/m(2). Plant nitrogen contents did not vary with distance from the main external nutrient supply. Together with low nitrogen concentrations in the plants (0.60 +/- 0.26 in culms and 0.99 +/- 0.50% in rhizomes), very high carbon to nitrogen ratios (49 +/- 20:1) and nitrogen fixation in the rhizosphere explaining only about half of the plants' nitrogen, papyrus is a likely net sink for nitrogen supplied from the lake's increasingly cultivated watershed. Despite this role, clearance of papyrus in favor of agriculture partly explains the reductions in the area of papyrus within the lake basin from 48 km(2) in the late 1960s to 14 km(2) in 1995.

AB A basic tenet of plant ecology is char under high light and limiting nutrient levels, carbon becomes relatively more available for investment in anti-herbivore defense. Rarely considered in discussions of such defense investments, however, is the necessity for plants to defend themselves against oxidative damage caused by light exposure itself To determine if the ability to respond to elevated levels of light exposure by increasing production of antioxidant compounds is a general characteristic of foliage in tropical plants, we conducted a broad survey of antioxidant content in foliage of 55 species in a tropical forest community by comparing individuals within forest gaps to conspecifics in the closed canopy forest. To do so, we devised a rapid assay to use under field conditions. Of the 41 species of shrubs, trees, and lianas demonstrating a discernible difference in antioxidant content under the two light regimes, 34 (68%) showed higher antioxidant content under high light conditions. In a quantitative laboratory-based study using four of these species, light was associated with a 15 to 45 percent increase in water-soluble antioxidants in three species; one species displayed a 118 percent increase in fat-soluble antioxidants as well. Thus, changes in the chemistry of plant foliage in response to light may reflect plant investments in defense against abiotic stress factors as well as investments in defense against biotic stress factors.

AB This paper presents the results of a field experiment investigating the effects of shoot removal at the end of the dry season on tillering and aerial biomass in three perennial savanna grasses. The experiment was intended to simulate the effects of savanna fires at the end of the dry season. The experiment included three initial size classes of plants that were allowed to grow free from competitors. The results showed an immediate negative effect of shoot removal on tiller number in all three species; however, at the end of the experiment, defoliated planes had recovered and their final sizes did not differ significantly from those of control plants. We registered an overcompensating response to shoot removal on aerial biomass of Trachypogon plumosus, while the other two species (Andropogon semiberbis and Leptocoryphium lanatum) compensated completely for the removed aerial biomass. Differences in initial plane size were only significant in L. lanatum. Shoot removal resulted in a significant decrease in the fraction of flowering tillers in T. plumosus, hut had no significant effects on flowering in A. semiberbis. Experimental plants of L. lanatum did nor flower during the experiment. Although inmediate shoot removal effects were strongly negative, the three species were able to recover nor only in the number of tillers but also in aerial biomass. Based on the differences between actual burning and experimental removal of shoots, we expect that the compensating responses to actual fire would be greater than the ones resulting from this study.

AB As with other plants having a relatively simple morphology, solitary palms are useful biological models for studying the life histories of long-lived plants. In the first study to investigate the life history of Borassus aethiopum, a widespread dioecious palm growing in African savannas, we found that: (1) the number of leaves increased up to reproductive maturity and then decreased during the reproductive period, while height increased throughout life; (2) female fecundity, measured as the number of seedlings within a few meters under the female canopies, decreased markedly in old individuals with few leaves; and (3) height distribution was strongly bimodal. This bimodality was due to variations in the stem elongation race during the life of the palm and the accumulation of adults with low mortality rates in the taller height classes. The observed pattern of fecundity and number of leaves in relation to height clearly suggests a senescence period that began just after sexual maturity and appeared to be protracted. Comparisons between the life history of B. aethiopum and the life histories of some forest palms showed that environmental conditions cannot in themselves explain the various palm life histories.

AB The clonal mat-forming fern, Dicranopteris linearis (N. L. Burm.) Underw., dominates vast areas of rainforests on the windward slopes of Mauna Loa Volcano on the island of Hawai'i. Because clone size has important ecological and evolutionary consequences in such a dominant species, we used isozyme analysis to investigate clone size and other aspects of genetic diversity and reproduction over a broad range of environmental conditions on primary successional sites (pahoehoe lava substrates).
   Isozyme analysis provided a measure of the upper limit of clonal size in this int interdigitating clonal species. Each 0.5-ha primary successional site on Mauna Loa was comprised of a minimum of two to four clones. Genetic diversity in Dicranopteris was low; of 32 purative loci investigated, only 4 were polymorphic, with 2 or 3 alleles/locus. Over the 17 study locations on Mauna Loa and Kilauea Volcanoes, we identified nine multilocus genotypes based on unique combinations of allozymes. Seven of the nine genotypes were heterozygous for at least one locus, evidence of an intergametophytic mating system. Highly dispersible spores, coupled with intergametophytic mating should promote higher genetic diversity We propose that the Following factors contributed to low genetic diversity: founder effects; extreme isolation from mainland gene pools; high potential for mating among different gametophytes produced from the same sporophyte; relatively low numbers of safe sites for gametophyte establishment over space and time; and long-term reliance on vegetative growth. Leaf phenotypes were associated with genotype, bur also with environmental conditions. Enough variability within a genotype existed to support the current treatment of Hawaiian Dicranopteris as one species.
   Vegetative growth was the primary means by which Dicranopteris covered the landscape. Nevertheless, spore production, gametophyte establishment, and sexual reproduction were absolutely essential for colonization of the few favorable microsites available on pahoehoe lava substrates of Mauna Loa following lava eruptions, dieback, and similar landscape-level disturbances.

ID SEED DISPERSAL
AB Hydrochory was investigated in the seeds of the Amazonian floodplain tree, Swartzia polyphylla, in which pods open on the tree to release one large seed. Seeds collected from beach drift along the Rio Negro showed a high percentage of floaters (82%). Yet most seeds sank following collection from: adult trees (89%), unflooded ground under adults (96%), and flooded ground under adults (86%). The specific gravity of the seeds was near that of water, 1.04 +/- 0.03 for sinkers and 0.98 +/- 0.02 for floaters. The ability to float was correlated directly with the volume of the air pocket between the two cotyledons, which varied from 5.6 to 20.5 percent of the total seed volume. In a long-term floatation test lasting 81 days, 45 percent of the seeds never floated, 33 percent always floated, and 22 percent first sank for one week and then floated for at least one month. Seeds that never floated eventually rotted, but not until days 63-73. Seeds that were floating at day 81, regardless of how long they had been floating, were placed on moistened tilter paper for 18 days during which time 36 percent germinated, 45 percent rotted, and 19 percent did neither but remained viable. These results suggest that S. polyphylla achieves dimorphism in flotation of its seeds, some sinking and some floating, by producing seeds of continuous variation in specific gravity around a mean close to 1.00. Seeds that float can be dispersed long distances along river margins, while those that sink may be moved only marginally from the parent tree.

AB We studied the bee fauna visiting a plant community of 10 species of flowering aquatic plants in an inundated savanna region in Bolivia. In total we observed 36 bee species in 17 genera at the flowers. Cluster analysis of the similarities among the plant species in terms of their visitor spectra showed a division into two groups: plants with inflorescence heights shorter than the grass height and plants with inflorescences projecting our of the surrounding vegetation. Larger bees of the genera Apis, Melipona, Bombus, and Xylocopa were observed only at hewers above the surrounding vegetation. Smaller, mainly solitary bees (e.g., Augochlorella, Ancyloscelis) visited flowers in the dense vegetation near the water surface. Analyses of the pollen loads revealed that most individuals were highly flower constant. When bees carried different pollen types, it was generally pollen from flowers within a single stratum. We discuss specialization, flower constancy, competition, and different foraging strategies as possible reasons for stratum fidelity.

ID FRUGIVOROUS BATS; PLANTS
AB We examined seed dispersal by bats and birds in four habitats of the Selva Lacandona tropical rain forest region, Chiapas, Mexico. The four habitats represented a disturbance gradient: active cornfield, ten-year-old abandoned cornfield, cacao plantation, and forest. Using seed traps examined before sunrise (0400 h) and before sunset (1800 h), we compared volant vertebrate seed dispersal, assuming that seeds found at the end of the night were dispersed by bats and those found at the end of the day were dispersed by birds. We did not find seeds from other frugivores such as monkeys or opossums. In all habitats bats dispersed more seeds than birds. In most months bats also dispersed more seeds than birds, except in December when no seeds were found in the traps. Bats also consistently dispersed more species of seeds than birds, although a chi(2) comparison showed differences not to be significant. Fifty percent of the species represented in the dispersed seeds in all habitats were pioneer species. Cecropia seeds represented a high percentage (up to 87% of those dispersed by bats and up to 83% by birds) of dispersed seeds that fell in our traps. The influence of bats and birds on secondary successional processes is likely to be fundamental for the establishment of vegetation. Since bats dispersed more seeds than birds (primarily to disturbed areas and consisting primarily of pioneer species), they are likely to play an important role in successional and restoration processes among habitats as structurally and vegetationally different as cornfields, old fields, cacao plantations, and forest.

AB Plant communities differ in species composition and litter input. To examine the influence of plant species on the abundance and community structure of soil fauna, we sampled earthworms in areas close to and away from the bases of Dacryodes excelsa and Heliconia caribaea, two distinct plant communities within a tropical wet forest in Puerto Rico. We also carried our a litter manipulation experiment to examine the short-term responses of earthworms to litter removal and litter addition treatments. We found that: (1) the density and biomass of both soil-feeding endogeic and litter-feeding anecic worms did not differ between areas close to and away from Dacryodes trees (in contrast, the density and biomass of anecic worms was higher in areas away from Heliconia plants despite the lack of differences for endogeic worms); and (2) total dry weight of earthworms tended to be higher in the litter addition treatment than in the control within the Heliconia community. Our results suggest that Heliconia caribaea has a strong negative influence on anecic earthworms and that earthworms in the Heliconia community are more sensitive to litter input than in the Dacryodes community.

ID OF-MEXICO
AB Harengula jaguana is a dominant species in the southern Gulf of Mexico. It is a demersal, estuarine-dependent species, distributed throughout the Campeche Sound area (12-54 m). It is found in areas influenced by coastal discharges. The size at first maturity of females is 117 mm total length. Reproduction occurs from February to October in depths 18-36 m. The juveniles are found on the shelf (<20 m) and inside the Terminos Lagoon. Recruitment is in two distinct periods, March-June and August-November, when adults and juveniles migrate to the outer shelf. Greatest abundance is observed in depths of 12-36 m. The biology and ecology of H. jaguana was analyzed in the Campeche Sound to better understand the structure and function of the demersal fish communities. It is a very important species in the trophic dynamics of the ecosystem because it transports matter and energy. A model of the biological pattern for this species in the area is proposed.

TI Feeding ecology of the giant otter, Pteronura brasiliensis
SO BIOTROPICA

DT Article
DE Amazon; Brazil; ecology; feeding habits; Pteronura brasiliensis
AB The food habits of the giant otter, Pteronura brasiliensis, were determined by analyzing fecal samples collected year-round from communal latrines at Xixuau Creek (00 degrees 48'S, 61 degrees 33'W), Jauaperi River (central Brazilian Amazon) between 1993 and 1994. Communal latrines were also sampled during the low water season at Aquidauana River (19 degrees 32'S, 56 degrees 40'W), Pantanal of Mato Grosso do Sul (central Brazil). Fragments of vertebrae, mandibles, teeth, scales, and fn spines provided an estimate of the diet composition. Remains of fish were present in all of the samples. The main fish groups found at Xixuau Creek were Perciformes, represented specifically by Cichlidae (97.3% of all samples), Characiformes (86.5%) and Siluriformes (5.4%). The Characiformes were represented mainly by Erythrinidae (Hoplias sp. 90.6%), followed by Serrasalmidae (28%). The Anostomidae occurred with a frequency of 18.7 percent, while Characinae, Bryconinae, and Cynodontidae were only observed in 3.1 percent of the Characiformes records. At: Aquidauana River, the Characiformes were the most frequent fish group, represented in 100 percent of all samples, followed by Siluriformes (66.6%) and Perciformes (33.3%). The fish from the main groups identified in the diet of the giant otters prefer riverbanks, lakes, and flooded forests. The feeding habits of Pteronura brasiliensis are probably influenced by the vulnerability and abundance of the prey consumed by this carnivore.

AB An ongoing study is being conducted to test the efficacy of the Anabat II detector and analysis system in obtaining reliable vocal signatures for the identification of non-phyllostomid species of bats. We sampled a wide range of elevations and associated habitat rr pes throughout Belize. Anabat provides an instantaneous output of echolocation call structure with a laptop computer. Select sequences can be saved directly to the hard drive, avoiding extraneous noise and sound distortion commonly associated with rape recorders. To dare, 18 of the 37 species known or expected to occur in the study region were identified by recognizable differences in the time-frequency characteristics of echolocation calls. In general, each family is recognizable by call structure patterns and species readily separated by frequency range parameters. Species that commute or forage at high altitudes are nor susceptible to capture bur are conspicuous by acoustic sampling. Further work is needed to determine limitations of the equipment, establish better sampling procedures, and develop a comprehensive library of vocal signatures incorporating the range of variation inherent in each species. As this work progresses, we predict the addition of hitherto unknown species occurring within the study region.

AB Maraca island is on the boundary of the Amazon rain forest and the Rio Branco-Rupunini savanna. The annual rainfall is ca 1800 mm, with a dry season from October-March and a wet season from April-September. A forest type dominated by Peltogyne gracilipes (Caesalpiniaceae) occurs on parts of the island and the adjacent mainland, the least species-rich (for trees > 10 cm DBH) of any recorded in Brazilian Amazonia. The goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that the dominance by Peltogyne is associated with an unusual litterfall mass, nutrient concentrations, or retranslocation. Three plots (50 x 50 m) were set up in each of three forest types of: (1) Peltogyne-rich forest (PRFa), dominated by Peltogyne gracilipes; (2) Peltogyne-poor forest (PPF), with a sparse occurrence of Peltogyne; and (3) forest without Peltogyne (FWPa). Litterfall was collected for 360 d at ca 15-d intervals in II randomly positioned traps (0.32 m(2)) per plot. Mature Peltogyne leaves were collected at random from three randomly selected understory Peltogyne trees in each of the three PRFa plots during the early dry and early wet season. Additionally, young Peltogyne leaves were collected during the early wet season. Chemical analyses were made on bulked (on a 2-mo basis) litterfall samples and young and mature Peltogyne leaves. The estimated annual litterfall was similar among PRFa (7.9 t/ha), PPF (9.1 t/ha) and FWPa (8.6 t/ha); however, PRFa was distinguished by its litterfall seasonality, because of the deciduous Peltogyne, and its higher concentrations of Ca (9.3 compared to 6.5 mg/g in FWPa) and Mg (3.2 compared to 19mg/g in FWPa). About 40-50 percent of N and P, 25-41 percent of K, and 2-13 percent of Mg were retranslocated from Peltogyne leaves.

AB We measured mature tree and sapling density, tree associations, crown size, age structure, recovery from ungulate browsing, and grass cover at four study sites in two types of subalpine woodland on Mauna Kea volcano, island of Hawaii. Beginning in 1981, introduced ungulates were reduced in number to allow regeneration of Sophora chrysophylla (mamane) in habitat supporting the endangered Hawaiian finch, Loxioides bailleui (palila). We found Sophora regeneration at all four study sites, but regeneration was higher in mixed species woodland with codominant Myoporum sandwicense (naio) than in areas where Sophora dominated. Regeneration of Myoporum was uniformly very low in comparison. Invasive grass cover, which suppresses Sophora germination, was highest in mid-elevation woodland where Sophora dominated. The distribution of mature and sapling Sophora were both related to study site, reflecting previous ungulate browsing and uneven recovery due to grasses. Densities of Sophora snags were not different among any of the sites, suggesting a more even distribution in the past. Selective browsing before ungulate reduction may have favored Myoporum over Sophora, leading to high densities of mature Myoporum in codominant woodland. After ungulate reduction, however, we found no pattern of competitive inhibition by Myoporum on regeneration of Sophora. Reduction of Myoporum is not likely to enhance habitat for Laxioides as much as supplemental plantings of Sophora, grass control, and continued ungulate eradication. Mid-elevation Sophora woodland areas, where Loxioides forage and nest in high densities, would benefit the most from these management actions.

AB This study reports results from the first explicit test of the ectomycorrhizal hypothesis for tropical monodominance in the Ituri Forest of the Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly Zaire), where the canopy tree Gilbertiodendron dewevrei forms large, monospecific stands. To test the hypothesis that ectomycorrhizae are important to the success of dominant species; we surveyed the mycorrhizal status of dominant species, as well as other common, but not dominant, species in the forest. The survey reveals that two dominant species, Gilbertiodendron dewevrei and Julbernardia seretii, form ectomycorrhizae and vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizae, while Cynometra alexandri, another dominant, forms only vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizae. These results, along with those of other species in this and other forests, are discussed within the context of the ectomycorrhizal hypothesis for tropical mondominance. This study demonstrates that the relationship between EM and tropical monodominance is more complex than has been previously recognized.

AB Vegetation, seed rain, seed germination, microclimate, and soil physical and chemical parameters were measured in a recently abandoned pasture and adjacent primary rain forest in southern Costa Rica. The goal of this study was to assess the importance of these factors in limiting forest regeneration in abandoned pastures. Seed rain of anima dispersed species decreased dramatically in the pasture >5 m from the forest/pasture edge; fewer wind dispersed seeds fell in the pasture than in the forest, but the difference was much less than for anima dispersed seeds. Percent seed germination of most species studied was similar in the forest and in pasture with grasses; seed germination was lower during the dry season in areas of pasture cleared of grasses. Air temperature, vapor pressure deficit (VPD), and photon flux density (PFD) were much higher in the pasture than in the forest at 1 m above the ground. VPD and PFD at ground level and soil temperature were similar in the pasture and the forest, indicating that pasture grasses strongly modify microclimatic conditions near the soil surface. The lowest gravimetric water content recorded in the pasture during the dry season was 0.5 and leaf relative water contents of the two species measured in the forest and pasture were identical, suggesting that plants in the pasture were not water stressed. Levels of most soil nutrients were lower in the pasture as compared to the forest; however, aboveground and root biomass for seedling grown in pasture and forest soils did not differ significantly. Although a number of factors impede forest recovery in abandoned pastures, these results suggest that the most important limitation is lack of seed dispersal.

AB The Coastal Plain of Chiapas (southern Mexico) was formerly covered by large tracts of subhumid tropical forests bur is heavily deforested at present. In this region, 15 pastures were selected to characterize species composition of isolated trees, as well as to describe species composition, growth form patterns, and patterns of dispersal units in the vegetation growing under their canopies. The 65 recorded pasture trees belonged to 20 species and 11 families, of which Fabaceae and Moraceae were the most species-rich. Coccoloba barbadensis (Polygonaceae) and Enterolobium cyclocarpum (Fabaceae) were the most abundant and frequent trees in the studied pastures. More than half (55%) of isolated tree species were fleshy-fruited. In the vegetation sampled under pasture trees, 134 species and 45 families were found. Fabaceae and Poaceae had the largest numbers of species. Herbs were the predominant growth form (46.3%), followed by shrubs (23.9%), trees (23.1%), and lianas (2.2%); 6 species could nor be placed in any growth form category. Most species of this flora were fleshy-fruited (43.3%), followed by heavy, gravity-dispersed fruits (17.9%). The analysis of dispersal units by growth form category confirmed the prevalence of fleshy fruits, although their predominance was not so obvious among herb species. Almost half (49.2%) of the flora under pasture trees was typical of secondary vegetation; this pattern was true for herbs but not for most woody species, which were typical of primary vegetation. A numeric classification of the vegetation samples taken under pasture trees produced eight floristic groups, all of which were independent of the specific identity of pasture trees. No significant effect of dispersal unit type of pasture tree on the characteristics of the vegetation growing under them was found. Future attempts to re-create the original forest cover using isolated trees in pastures as regeneration foci should pay more attention to the maintenance of a large specific diversity independently of the dispersal types among these components of tropical landscapes.

AB Raised-field agricultural systems were exploited extensively by pre-Columbian Andean civilizations and now are used less extensively by contemporary Bolivian and Peruvian farmers as a method for farming the perennially wet soils of the intermontane pampas of the Andean high altiplano. The raised-field agricultural systems are linear or semi-linear raised planting platforms interspersed with shallow, parallel canals filled with water. The elevated planting platforms raise the critical rooting zone of crops such as potatoes, quinoa, or barley above perennially saturated soils. A hypothesized advantage of the raised-field system is that agricultural production can be increased by exploiting the ability of bacteria and Azolla fililculoides to fix nitrogen in the canals adjacent to the planting platforms.
   To test this hypothesis, nitrogen fixation was estimated in situ in the water column of canals, in the soils of planting platforms, in the soils of a dry hillside field, and in the sediments and water column of marshes and totora beds. Nitrogen fixation was significantly greater in the canals of the raised-field systems and in marshes compared to planting platforms and the hillside field. These data support the theory that pre-Hispanic agricultural prosperity of the Andes, as well as other regions of Central and South America, was partially supported by extensive development of raised-field agriculture and probable exploitation of nitrogen fixation.

AB To clarify the small-scale heterogeneity of light regimes in a rain forest, photosynthetic photon Awe density (PFD) was measured at 1-min intervals during six days at 12 microsites in each of two plots, a small gap and an understory in Pasoh Forest Reserve, Peninsular Malaysia. Frequency distribution of microsite PFD was unimodal with the peak value between 16 and 32 mu mol/m(2)/sec in the small gap, bur between 8 and 16 mu mol/m(2)/sec in the understory. In the small gap, PFD was more variable among microsites; total daily PFD and daily sunfleck PFD exceeding 10 mu mol/ m(2)/sec tended to be higher (P < 0.05; t-rest) compared to those in the understory. Sunfleck PFD exceeding 50 mu mol/ m(2)/sec, however, showed no difference between the two plots. Diffuse PFD transmittance, defined as the ratio of PFD in the Forest to that measured at 43 m above ground during the periods 0800-0810 and 1750-1800 h, was significantly higher in the small gap than in the understory plot. Diffuse PFD transmittance was also positively correlated with microsite total daily PFD. To examine the effects of the subtle heterogeneity of light regimes on leaf carbon gain, we simulated carbon gain by sun and shade leaves in a typical shade-tolerant species, Brosimum alicastrum Sw. (Moraceae). Despite the similarity in total daily PFD, total daily carbon gain was considerably higher in the gap than in the understory for both sun and shade leaves. This study suggests that frequency distribution of PFD is critical in describing microsite PFD regimes and determining leaf carbon gain in the tropical forest Boor.

AB After defoliation by herbivores, some plants exhibit enhanced rates of photosynthesis and growth that enable them to compensate for lost tissue, thus maintaining their fitness relative to competing, undefoliated plants. Our aim was to determine whether compensatory photosynthesis and growth would be altered by increasing concentrations of atmospheric CO2. Defoliation of developing leaflets on seedlings of a tropical tree, Copaifera aromatica, caused increases in photosynthesis under ambient CO2, but not under elevated CO2. An enhancement in the development of buds in the leaf axils followed defoliation at ambient levels of CO2. In contrast, under elevated CO2, enhanced development of buds occurred in undefoliated plants with no further enhancement in bud development due to exposure to elevated CO2. Growth of leaf area after defoliation was increased, particularly under elevated CO2. Despite this increase, defoliated plants grown under elevated CO2 were further from compensating for tissue lost during defoliation after 5-1/2 weeks than those grown under ambient CO2 concentrations.

AB Tetramerista glabra has a remarkable combination of life history traits. it is a dense-wooded, large, common canopy tree in primary pear swamp rain forest. Its seedlings, although shade tolerant, can grow rapidly in high light conditions, but frequently lack structural stability Most juvenile stems (94% in the understory and 38% in canopy gaps) collapse under their own weight or from branchfalls. Fallen stems then ramify into vegetative sprouts, which in turn may collapse, perpetuating a vegetative juvenile cycle. Most recruitment is from sprouts rather than from seed. Structural analysis of stem dimensions shows that stems 2-8 cm DBH (diameter at breast height) are dose to the theoretical buckling limit, especially for those dependent on neighboring vegetation to maintain vertical form. Trees > 4 cm DBH persisting as upright stems develop stilt root support and become structurally independent at ca 8 cm DBH. Eventually, as stems thicken, stilt roots anastamose and trees adopt the cylindrical growth form of mature canopy trees (up to 150 cm DBH). Thus, the vegetative life history strategy of the species is to: (i) regenerate a large "ramet bank" from the majority of juveniles that fail structurally while suppressed in the understory, and (ii) to maximize height growth at the expense of diameter growth in high light conditions. The growth pattern and plastic form of I:glabra shows how a shade tolerant species may adapt to utilize the ephemeral light resource in canopy gaps. The growth strategy of this species allows it to circumvent the normal trade-off between shade tolerance and rapid growth in Canopy gaps.

AB The stems of the ant-plant, Endospermum labios Schodde, serve as colonization sites for the ant, Camponotus quadriceps F. Smith. They are also subject to damage by insect borers. We sampled young E. labios trees in disturbed forest to compare evidence of stem boring insect and stem miner damage in plants with and without colonies of C. quadriceps. Dissections of a subsample of plants showed that dipteran stem borers and stem miner damage were significantly more common in plants lacking C. quadriceps colonies than in plants with established colonies. Evidence from these dissections and from field counts of meristem damage caused by emerging borers suggested that coleopteran stem borers were also more abundant when ants were nor present.
   In addition to the incidence of stem boring insects and ant colonies, we examined relative levels of leaf pubescence by measuring trichome density and leaf size for E. labios trees. We found that trichome density was significantly greater in trees with evidence of prior shoot damage (presumably from stem borer emergence at the meristem) but was not significantly related to the presence or absence of an ant colony. This prompted us to compare trichome density on leaves of nearby small trees and of different branches of the same tree, pairing a stem/branch that appeared damaged with one that appeared healthy Trichome densities on leaves from damaged stems and branches were significantly greater than were trichome densities on healthy branches and stems. Based on these empirical data, we present several possible explanations for the patterns of association between ants, stem borers, and pubescence. Although feeding preference rests with a common folivore showed no effect of trichome densities on leaves, we suggest further study on how trichomes may affect ovipositing stem borers.

AB Characters involved in pollinaror attraction are likely maintained by selection. Plants that invest more in flora displays and/or rewards are expected to attract more pollinators than those that do nor. A large number of plants, however, are severely pollen-limited yet either produce small rewards or none at all. The orchid, Comparettia falcata, is a pollinator-dependent, self-compatible epiphyte distributed throughout the Greater Antilles, Central and South America. In Puerto Rico where it is pollinated by the hummingbird Chlorostilbon maugaeus, C. falcata presents a smaller nectar reward than most other plants pollinated by the same species. To determine whether or nor selection would favor the production of higher nectar levels, we enhanced the quantity of nectar offered by flowers in a Puerto Rican population for two flowering seasons. We monitored visitation frequencies, pollen movement, and reproductive success at three sites with different canopy coverages. Daily censuses of hummingbirds provided estimates of relative pollinator abundance. A multiway contingency test employing Wald's statistic showed no overall differences in reproductive success between plants with enhanced rewards and unmanipulated controls. Site differences, however, were clear. Plants of the mid- and high-light sites had greater success than those of the low-light sire, and the differences were usually at lease two-fold. There was a significant site-treatment interaction in reproductive success that could be attributed to the overall trend whereby controls of both mid- and high-light sites did better than the nectar-enhanced plants. Most of the observed pollinations (85%) with stained pollinia resulted in self-pollinations that did nor differ among treatments. Seed crops from self and cross-pollinations revealed no differences in the number of viable seeds. Because we found little evidence of selection for increasing nectar reward via inbreeding depression or male and female reproductive success, and previous studies have indicated that meager natural levels of reward are better than none at all, we suspect thar reward production in C. falcata may be driven by a combination of pollination-limitation and resource constraints.

ID MUTUALISM; EVOLUTION; WASPS
AB Style length variation in Female flowers of monoecious figs has been shown to play an important role in regulating the proportion of Bowers that develop into seeds and those that become infested by the pollinator wasp. In this study, we tested the suggestion that style length variation in figs is a consequence of optimal packing of the flowers. We show that optimal packing of flowers in fig syconia will result in a highly skewed distribution of style lengths and a positive skewness of pedicel lengths. These predictions were qualitatively rested in eight species of figs and the results indicate that observed style length distributions did not conform to chose expected. We argue that while the pedicel lengths ate likely to be a spinoff of optimal packing of the flowers, style lengths are probably shaped by independent selective forces. The pedicel lengths also are subjected to compensatory growth so as to place the stigmas at a common height in the central cavity for effective pollination of the flowers. This was substantiated by the response (dependence) of pedicels to (on) the length of the style, neck, and other floral features. In all species the coefficient of variation of styles was very consistent (ca 30%). This is in accordance with expectations if style lengths are shaped to regulate the proportion of flowers for wasp and seed production.

AB The faunas of tank bromeliads were sampled over two years in three forest types at different elevations in the Luquillo Experimental Forest, Puerto Rico, and the diversity of their animal communities compared. Bromeliad plants behaved as islands in that, within forests, the species richness and abundance of their animal communities were significantly and positively correlated with increase in plans size. The amount of canopy debris they accumulated was similarly correlated with increase in plant size. Overall diversity was lowest in the dwarf forest, where plants were uniformly small. Animal communities were stable from year so year, and could be characterised for each forest type and for compartments within the plane. They showed a pattern of high dominance, which increased with elevation (McNaughton index 37, 54, and 73, respectively, for the tabonuco, palo colorado, and dwarf forest). Alpha-diversity for sites sampled in each year reflected net primary productivity (NPP) of the forest, declining with increasing elevation when anima abundance measures were used (jackknife estimates of Simpson's diversity index 6.54 & 11.04 [tabonuco], 3.53 & 6.22 [pao colorado], and 2.75 & 2.17 [dwarf forest]). Species richness over the two years, however, was highest in the intermediate pale colorado forest (187 species), compared to 146 and 88 in the tabonuco and dwarf forests, respectively. These figures were close to jackknife estimates of maximum species richness. The difference in species richness between tabonuco and pale colorado forests was significant in one year only. In addition to NPP, other factors, such as litter quality and the structural complexity of the habitat in the pale colorado forest, may have: influenced species richness. The most abundant species in individual plants were also the most widely occurring, confirming known patterns of abundance and distribution in other functional groups. Diversity within bromeliad microcosms at different elevations supported known relationships between diversity productivity, and habitat complexity along gradients and was not related to differences in the total bromeliad habitat available for colonization.

AB Previous work has shown that water loss in some populations of Anolis cristatellus from the British Virgin Islands is closely tied to the conditions available on the islands they inhabit. This manifested itself in a strong correlation between habitat aridity and several water loss rate parameters. Here we report on a similar study conducted in the same locations in 1994, a year of extreme drought.
   We hypothesized that lizards caught at the height of the drought will experience lower rates of water loss than those measured during a normal year. Our findings show that in 1994, as in 1993, habitat aridity and water loss parameters were strongly correlated. Also as before, the Guana Island population of A. cristatellus displayed higher resistance to water loss than expected by the island's aridity. However, a striking change occurred within populations. All were at least as good at retaining water (measured as integumentary resistance to water loss, R) as in 1993, and some were over 3.5 times better. Existing evidence is insufficient to determine whether these changes were the result of phenotypic plasticity or attributable to differential mortality of nonresistant individuals.

AB We studied roosting and foraging behavior of two Neotropical gleaning bars, d'Orbigny's round-eared bar, Tonatia silvicola, and the fringe-lipped bat, Trachops cirrhosus (Phyllostomidae). Techniques included radio-tracking in a tropical lowland forest in Panama and analysis of data from long-term studies in Panama and Venezuela. Day roosts of I: silvicola were in arboreal termite nests. T. cirrhosus roosted in a hollow tree. T. silvicola emerged late (ca 60 min after sunset), and foraged close to the roosts (maximum distance 200-500 In). T. cirrhosus emerged early (ca 30 min after local sunset), and foraged farther from its roost (>1.5 km). Both bats used small foraging areas (3-12 ha) in tall, open Forest. They foraged in continuous flight (maximum 27-36 min) or in short sally flights (<1 minute) from perches ("hang-and-wait" strategy). The small foraging areas of these bars and their sedentary foraging mode most likely make them vulnerable to habitat fragmentation.

AB It is currently recognized that the method used to collect phenology data can affect the resulting pattern. However to dare, the underlying influences have not been examined. To examine potential methodological biases, we investigated the effects of phenological method, sample size, and species composition on phenological patterns using data collected to estimate food availability for three primate species in Ranomafana National Park, Madagascar. Two phenological methods were compared: selected tree observations and systematic transect monitoring. By generating bootstrapped subsamples derived from the transect tree data set, we simulated two selected tree data sets and subsequently compared the observed and bootstrapped values. Although the observed values fell within the bootstrapped confidence intervals, suggesting no significant effects of sampling protocol or sample size, additional lines of evidence suggest otherwise. Observed samples composed of different plant species; whether based on species attributes such as life-form or categories such as food versus nonfood planes, consistently produced different phenological patterns. Wide confidence intervals of the bootstrapped samples indicate high individual variation in reproductive activity within the species sampled. Finally, we compared how well the selected tree and the transect methods represented food items used by all three primate species studied and found that transect methods sampled a wider diversity of food items, including rare foods, and a higher percentage of main primate food items than selected tree methods.

AB The effects of fire on forest structure and composition were studied in a severely fire-impacted landscape in the eastern Amazon. Extensive sampling of area forests was used to compare structure and compositional differences between burned and unburned forest stands.
   Burned forests were extremely heterogeneous, with substantial variation in forest structure and fire damage recorded over distances of <50 m. Unburned forest patches occurred within burned areas, but accounted for only six percent of the sample area. Canopy cover, living biomass, and living adult stem densities decreased with increasing fire intensity/frequency, and were as low as 10-30 percent of unburned forest values. Even light burns removed >70 percent of the sapling and vine populations. Pioneer abundance increased dramatically with burn intensity, with pioneers dominating the understory in severely damaged areas. Species richness was inversely related to burn severity, but no clear pattern of species selection was observed.
   Fire appears to be a cyclical event in the study region: <30 percent of the burned forest sample had been subjected to only one burn. Based on estimated solar radiation intensities, burning substantially increases fire susceptibility of forests. At least 50 percent of the total area of all burned forests is predicted to become flammable within Ib rainless days, as opposed to only 4 percent of the unburned forest. In heavily burned forest subjected to recurrent fires, 95 percent of the area is predicted to become flammable in <9 rain-free days. As a recurrent disturbance phenomenon, fire shows unparalleled potential to impoverish and alter the forests of the eastern Amazon.

AB Edge structure is one of the principal determinants of the extent and magnitude of edge effects in forest fragments. In central Amazonia, natural succession at forest edges typically produces a dense wall of vegetation dominated by Cecropia spp. that buffers the forest interior. Fire encroachment into forest edges, however, eliminates the soil seed bank, enhances plant mortality, and promotes succession to an open, Vismia-dominated edge that does not buffer the forest interior. Contrasting open, fire-encroached forest edges and closed, non-fire-encroached edges were examined in central Amazonia to assess the effects of edge structure on microclimate and vegetation structure in tropical forest fragments. Edge penetration distances for most microclimate and vegetation structure variables were as much as two to five times greater at open edges than at closed edges. The magnitude of these differences suggests that edge structure is one of the main determinants of microclimate and vegetation structure within tropical forest fragments.
   Edge effects also varied systematically with fragment area. For a given edge type, 100-ha fragments had consistently lower canopy height, higher foliage density, higher temperature, a higher rate of evaporative drying, lower leaf litter moisture content, and lower litter depth than continuous forest, at all distances from the forest edge. These differences, however, were relatively minor compared to the striking differences in edge penetration between open and closed forest edges. For organisms in small fragments, the difference between open and closed edges may be the difference between total edge encroachment on one hand and an effective nature reserve on the other, relatively independent of absolute fragment area.

DT Article
DE Colombia; pasture; secondary growth; tropical deforestation
AB Deforestation races were estimated in 270 km(2) of lowland moist forest on the eastern slope of the Colombian Andes (300-800 m). Deforestation was quantified by determining areas of pasture, secondary growth, and forest in aerial photographs (1:19,000-1:60,000) taken in the 1930s, 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. Mean annual deforestation rate for the 1938-1988 period was 1.5 percent, and ranged from <0.1 percent (1938-1955) to 4.4 percent (1970s-1980s). Between the 1930s and the 1980s, areas covered by pasture and young secondary forest increased from 26-53 percent and from 2-14 percent, respectively. This suggests that, although there are areas with clear signs of forest regeneration, the overall trend is the conversion of mature tropical forests to pastures for cattle ranching.

AB Floristic differences between cattle-grazed and macropod-grazed sites (protected from domestic stock by enclosure within a Holocene lava flow) were examined in Eucalyptus savanna in north Queensland, Australia. While macropod-grazed sites have had a lower incidence of fire than the cattle-grazed sites, it seems probable that grazing impacts per se are the major differences between these treatments. One dominant (Capillipedium parviflorum) and another common (Sehima nervosa) native perennial grass in the macropod-grazed treatment were not recorded within the cattle-grazed treatment. There was generally a lower species richness and Shannon-Weaver diversity of perennial forbs in the cattle-grazed treatment compared to the macropod-grazed treatment. There was higher richness, diversity, and abundance of annual grasses in the cattle-grazed treatment compared to the macropod-grazed treatment. The relative richness of native and exotic species was not significantly affected by cattle grazing.

AB The taxonomic list and the structure of benthic diatom assemblages occurring in fine sediments (silt and sand) from the mangrove forest of the Balandra lagoon in Baja California Sur, Mexico was determined based on seasonal samplings for one year. Assemblage structure was analyzed using several ecological indices for estimating diversity (H'), dominance (REDI), equitability and similarity. A total of 230 diatom taxa were identified and include 109 new records for the Baja California peninsula coast. Taxa representative of highly productive and hypersaline environments were common. Assemblages were characterized by a few abundant species and many uncommon or rare taxa. High diatom diversity estimates at all sampling sites during all seasons suggest that diatom assemblages in sediments of the Balandra lagoon represent a quasi-pristine environment.

   decumbens; Brazil cerrado; edge effect; habitat fragmentation; Melinis

AB Several species of African grasses brought to Brazil as cattle forage have spread widely, outcompeting native herb species. The open forms of Brazilian savanna ("campo cerrado" and "campo sujo") are the most affected by such invasions, because their structure is open, permitting enough sunlight into the lower strata. The invasion of alien forage grasses occurs in almost every cerrado nature reserve. This study was carried out in the "Cerrado de Emas Biological Reserve", Pirassununga, Sao Paulo State, Brazil, with the following objectives: (a) to compare the abundance of native and alien grass species; (b) to verify the importance of such alien grasses in the community; (c) to identify distribution patterns for the alien grass species in a gradient from the edge (highly disturbed) to the center (less disturbed) of the reserve; and (d) to explore the distribution of native and alien grasses in the search for possible competitive interactions. Using the "point method," a total of 260 points was sampled and 52 species were recorded. The four most frequent species (FA = absolute frequency) were two native (Echinolaena inflexa [Poir.] Chase [FA = 38.85%] and Diandrostachya hrysotrix [Nees] Jacues Felix [FA = 15.38%]) and two alien African species (Melinis minutiflora Beauv. [FA = 33.08%] and Brachiaria decumbens Stapf [FA = 13.85%]). M. minutiflora and E. inflexa had higher values of absolute vigor (67.69 and 59.62%, respectively), relative vigor(28.16 and 24.80%, respectively), and cover (100.77 and 98.47, respectively), indicating higher biomasses and densities and their dominance in the community. B. decumbens presented the highest number of contacts per point, showing the highest stratification. To detect possible edge-center distribution gradients, correspondence analysis was done, initially using all the recorded species and subsequently only the four more frequent grasses, with similar results: (a) the alien grasses, especially M. minutiflora, did not show a distinct distribution gradient from edge to center, but occurred over the whole reserve; (b) no distinct ecotonal band around the reserve (edge-belt) was detected, the whole reserve seeming to be "ecotonal"; and (c) E. inflexa and M. minutiflora showed similar phytosociological patterns, and spatial distribution; association between these two species was statistically significant.

AB The three most common tree fern species in a Mexican montane cloud forest fragment (Alsophila firma, Lophosoria quadripinnata and Sphaeropteris horrida) were selected for laboratory and transplant experiments. The objectives were: (1) to determine the percentage of spore germination and gametophytes producing sporophytes, and (2) to compare early establishment of sporophytes at the edge and in the interior of the forest. Percent spore germination varied between 16 and 86 percent, and the number of gametophytes that produced sporophytes was high (>50%). Survival and growth of sporophytes differed between species and habitats. Survival was greater at the edge than in the forest interior for Lophosoria, but it was similar for Alsophila and Sphaeropteris. Number and length of fronds were higher at the forest edge for individuals of Alsophila and Lophosoria, bur not for Sphaeropteris. RGR was higher at the forest edge than in the forest interior for sporophytes of the three species. This study suggests that the forest edge is an appropriate habitat for establishment of Alsophila and Lophosoria, but Sphaeropteris is apparently a forest interior species.

The study was done in a forest at Los Tuxtlas, Veracruz, on the Gulf of Mexico coast. Palms were randomly selected and total litter retention was quantified by determining dry weight over two years. Litter interception by palms was 4.4 and 27.1 Mg/ha/yr for the first and second years, respectively and accounted for 47.9 and 239.4 percent of the reported annual litterfall in the same area. Results showed that litter interception by plants is related to litterfall and should therefore be added to total litterfall in order to calculate the net primary productivity.

AB Entire root systems of saplings of five canopy species and of six shrub and treelet species growing in lowland mixed dipterocarp forest at Andulau, Brunei were excavated and measured. Referring to a prior study at Gigante, Panama, two-way, fixed-factor ANOVAs were used to compare life-forms and sites. Rooting depth and the proportion of root surface area in the upper 20 cm of soil did nor differ significantly between life-forms because some treelets/shrubs at Andulau were deep-rooted; all saplings studied were deep-rooted. The root:leaf area ratios of both saplings and treelets/shrubs at Andulau were significantly higher than those at Gigante. We attribute this strong difference to the lower soil content of available nutrients at Andulau where rainfall shortage is less severe and regular than ac Gigante. Available data on life-form composition and mortality rates in large plots are consistent with our proposal chat shallow-rooted shrubs and treelets are more vulnerable to drought than deep-rooted life-forms. We suggest that future studies of water use partitioning, wood anatomy, leaf morphology, and associations with neighboring planes would benefit from an explicit examination of their relation to rooting depth.

AB The probability of achieving a sustainable tropical logging operation is increased if the growth of surviving trees is maximized after logging. This research examined the growth ecology of seedlings and trees of the Neotropical timber species, Carapa nicaraguensis (Meliaceae). Shadehouse experiments, field plantings, and growth rare analyses tested the hypothesis that Carapa seedlings and trees experience higher growth rates in high light levels (recently formed logging gaps or logged forest plots) than in low light levels (old logging gaps or undisturbed forest plots). Consistently poor seedling growth rates under lour light conditions suggest that seedlings establishing in newly formed gaps will be more successful than those establishing in building-phase gaps. Thus, the first year after logging is a critical time for gap recolonization by Carapa and seed casting into gaps after logging is recommended. Growth of Carapa trees was significantly faster in logged forest than in undisturbed forest, and was positively associated with light availability. The results provide evidence chat harvest models can be both diameter- and illumination-based Crown illumination was nor significantly higher in logged forest than in undisturbed forest, indicating that the illumination scale for this study was not sensitive enough to detect increases in light availability brought about by selective logging. Potential silvicultural methods (particularly poison-girdling) that maintain adequate forest light levels in Carapa swamps without significantly altering long-term tree diversity or allowing invasion of secondary species should be explored.

The sample included shaded seedlings From dispersed seeds, undispersed seeds under parent trees, and seedlings transplanted to gaps. We quantified the light environment using hemispherical canopy photographs taken above seedlings at the beginning and end of the one-year study.
   Seedlings transplanted to gaps grew faster and had more leaves, larger total leaf surface area, longer secondary roots, and greater root mass than shaded seedlings. Seedlings in gaps did not differ from shaded seedlings in survivorship or amount of herbivore- and pathogen-caused leaf damage.
   The canopy photographs taken one year apart suggest there is a rough equilibrium in dosed canopies with slight changes occurring around an average light level. Sites with < 0.06 ISF (a unitless, relative measure of canopy openness or reflected sunlight) tended to remain the same with minor fluctuations toward brighter or darker. Sites with canopy openness > 0.06 ISF tended to close; few gaps grew larger.
   Seedlings under parent trees and seedlings away from parent trees had similar amounts of leaf damage and virtually identical survivorship after 18 months, but seedlings under parent trees had slower growth rates and smaller total leaf surface areas. Dispersal did not strongly benefit seeds via escaping high levels of mortality or competition around the parent.

AB Biological aspects of the development of the buttonwood mangrove, Conocarpus erectus L., from Barra de Tecoanapa, Guerrero, Mexico are described. Litterfall, flowers and seed production, leaf turnover, decomposition of leaves, and the optimal use of this species by the local community are quantified. Conocarpus erectus produces mean litterfall of 2.6 g/m(2)/d, increasing (>20%) during the wet season. This is comparable to production recorded for other mangrove species of the Pacific and Caribbean. Flowering and fruiting are continuous bur seed viability is (<12%). This is more critical during the dry season when <5 percent of seed germinates and only 1.6 percent of seedlings survive to form flowers after 25-28 mo. Leaf development is rapid for the first 64 days, with completion in 136 +/- 9 days, giving an annual leaf turnover >2.6. High leaf cellulose and lignin content results in a slow decomposition rate (up to 284 d). Organic matter content in green leaves is greater (95%) than in yellow leaves (85%). The local people exploit the forest selectively using three species of tree, of which C. erectus and Laguncularia racemosa are most used. Buttonwood mangrove wood is used in house construction, fencing, and for firewood. Exploitation has altered gravely areas near occupation, creating clearings chat will not recover easily. Some recommendations for the recuperation of these areas are presented, including proposals for more rational exploitation of this wetlands resource.

AB We investigate the ant fauna associated with the Neotropical treehopper, Guayaquila xiphias, on shrubs of Didymopanax vinosum in the cerrado (savanna) of SE Brazil. Treehoppers infested plane at the border of the cerrado almost euclusively and preferably fed near the apical meristem. During the reproductive phase of the host plant, however, the vast majority of the treehoppers aggregated on the inflorescences. We found 21 ant species harvesting honeydew at G. xiphias aggregations, the most frequent being Camponotus rufipes, Ectatomma edentatum, C. crassus, and C. renggeri. Such a taxonomic diversity of ants tending G. xiphias aggregations in the cerrado is far greater than that reported for any other ant-homopteran system. Daily turnover of ant species at a given treehopper aggregation was observed on 29 percent (64 out of 222) of the G. xiphias aggregations recorded on D. vinosum shrubs. Species replacements probably reflect distinct humidity and temperature ranges tolerated by the species, and may ultimately reduce interspecific competition at homopteran aggregations. Since predation and parasitism on G. xiphias can be severe, and tending: ants protect the homopterans against predators and parasitoids, the round-the-clock activity by ants at G. xiphias aggregations is regarded as crucial for the survival of these treehoppers in the cerrado.

AB Primary seed dispersal by two species of monkeys and the effects of rodents and dung beetles on the face of dispersed seeds are described for a rain forest in southeastern Peru. During the six-month study period (June-November 1992) spider monkeys (Ateles paniscus) dispersed the seeds of 71 plant species, whereas howler monkeys (Alouatta seniculus) dispersed seeds of 14 species. Spider and howler monkeys also differed greatly in their ranging behavior and defecation patterns, and as a consequence, produced different seed rain patterns. Monkey defecations were visited by 27 species of dung beetles (Scarabaeidae). Dung beetles buried 41 percent of the seeds in the dung, but the number of seeds buried varied greatly according to seed size. Removal rates of unburied seeds by rodents varied between 63-97 percent after 30 d for 8 plant species. The presence of fecal material increased the percentage of seeds removed by seed predators, but this effect became insignificant with time. Although seed predators found some seeds buried in dung balls (mimicking burial by dung beetles), depth of burial significantly affected the face of these seeds. Less than 35 percent of Brosimum lactescens seeds buried inside dung balls at a depth of 1 cm remained undiscovered by rodents, whereas at least 75 percent of the seeds escaped rodent detection at a depth of 3 cm and 96 percent escaped at 5 cm. Both dung beetles and rodents greatly affected the face of seeds dispersed by monkeys. It is thus important to consider postdispersal factors affecting the fate of seeds when assessing the effectiveness of frugivores as seed dispersers.

AB Studies focusing on gametophytic competition have focused on differences in pollen performance (e.g., pollen germination rate and pollen tube growth rate) among donors in order to examine genetic sources of variation in siring success among them. Donors that produce the fastest growing pollen tubes are expected to fertilize more ovules relative to donors with slow growing pollen tubes under conditions of gametophyic competition. However,the performance of pollen in the field is known to be influenced by environmental conditions in addition to the genotype of donor planes. This field study of Faramea occidentalis was conducted to: (1) determine the effect of environmental conditions during pollination on pollen performance; (2) measure differences among pollen donors in pollen performance; (3) determine if the pollen of different donors responds differently to a variety of environmental conditions surrounding pollinated flowers; and (4) measure differences among pollen recipients in pollen performance. Single-donor crosses were made between four pollen donors and four pollen recipients under a variety of environmental conditions. Pollen performance was then quantified as the growth rate of the fastest pollen tube, the mean pollen tube growth rate, and by a pollen germination index. Pollination environment (the environment surrounding a pollinated flower) and recipient significantly affected all three measures of pollen performance. Pollen donors did not differ overall in pollen performance. However, there was significant among-donor variation in two of the five pollination environment conditions. Future studies of variation in relative siring success may benefit by considering pollination environment in addition to donor and recipient identity.

AB The phenology of principal fruits consumed by the endangered Great Pied Hornbill (Buceros bicornis) was monitored for two years in a wet forest habitat in southern India. Lipid-rich fruits, produced by several interior forest trees mainly of the family Lauraceae, were highly seasonal in their availability, and their production in the dry, hot season coincided with the breeding of the hornbill. Sugary fruits, produced mainly by several species of Ficus, were available year-round due to aseasonal fruiting patterns. Because Ficus fruited even at times of low fruit resource availability, and was heavily utilized by hornbills and other frugivores, it played a keystone role in the maintenance of the avian frugivore community. Overall fruit production was scarce between July and January during the southwest and northeast monsoon seasons. Vitex altissima produced berries abundantly during much of this rime (September-December) and thus was another important fruit resource for avian frugivores. To safeguard the fruit resource base for the Great Pied Hornbill, we recommend: (1) The protection of Ficus and Vitex trees from overexploitation, and (2) the conservation of forest integrity to maintain compositions and densities of the lipid-rich fruit tree species utilized by the hornbill.

Several experiments show chat the tolerant behavior of the ants toward these frogs is due to chemical components of the frogs' skin. Comparisons to other syntopic hog species suggest that this enables these frogs to make use of burrows that otherwise are unavailable. This is advantageous because in the savanna, most hiding places that remain moist during the dry season are occupied by ants.

AB This study investigated the importance of gap formation in mangrove swamps on the island of Kosrae, Federated States of Micronesia, in order to understand better both natural processes of forest development and the effects of harvesting trees for firewood in these wetlands. Measurements were concentrated in seven plots located near four rivers: three in fringe zones and four in basin zones. Each plot was a cluster of five points and covered an area of ca 1.3 ha. From every point in each of the seven plots, the nearest canopy gap greater than or equal to 10 m(2) was located; 25 of the 35 gaps were formed by harvesting. Porewater salinity was significantly higher under the canopy in fringe mangrove forests than in basin mangrove forests. Although gaps were small (mean gap size = 158 m(2); median gap size = 92 m(2)), soil temperatures were significantly higher in gaps of both zones. Soil redox potential was significantly lower and porewater salinity significantly higher in the gaps than under the canopy in the basin zone only. Higher porewater salinity may be attributed to high evaporation rates from the soil and high transpiration rates from trees surrounding gaps. There were significantly more seedlings in gaps than under the canopy only in the fringe zones. Although gap formation alters the soil environment of Kosraean mangrove swamps, high freshwater input may buffer these effects in basin mangrove swamps by reducing porewater salinity. Current harvesting rates do not appear to be changing canopy species composition, but large gaps, especially in mangrove forests in more arid areas, may lead to major changes.

AB Forest closure on the three original Krakatau Islands (Panjang, Rakata, and Sertung) took place ca 1930, about 50 yr after the apparent sterilization of the islands due to volcanic eruptions. Two permanent forest plots were established on each of these islands in 1989. A full enumeration of these plots, of two additional Rakata plots, and of two "mainland" plots from the Ujung Kulon National Park, West Java, was undertaken in 1992. These data provide the first estimates of aboveground biomass from Krakatau. The values reported for Krakatau are below the local West Javan figures, with considerable variation occurring within the islands. In 1992, the fourth Krakatau island, Anak Krakatau, began an eruption sequence which continued through the study period, depositing ash on the study sites of Panjang and Sertung. A further partial survey of these plots in 1994-1995 revealed a significant increase in mortality since the volcanic activity recommenced, with an increase in deaths of larger stems. Although Rakata has not been influenced directly by volcanism, three sites surveyed on Rakata in 1994-1995 have experienced increased tree mortality, in two cases as a consequence of storm damage and in particular, of lightning strikes. Stand dynamics on Krakatau thus appear to be strongly influenced by episodic environmental disturbance with varying degrees of dependence on the volcanic activity of Anak Krakatau.

AB Survival and growth of seedlings and sprouts were assessed in three plots for 16 mo following the slashing and burning of a tropical deciduous forest in Jalisco, Mexico. We encountered a total of 47 species: 21 seedling species and 35 sprout species. Calliandra formosa and Piptadenia flava were the most common seedling species; Bursera arborea, Cordia alliodora, and Piptadenia constricta were the most common sprouts. Colubrina triflora, Diphysa occidentalis, and Cnidoscolus spinosus had limited sprouting ability. Twenty-six species were represented by one seedling or one sprout. Thirty-eight percent of the seedlings were tree species, 59 percent were shrub species, and 2 percent were vines species. In contrast, 86 percent of the sprouts were from trees and 13 percent from shrubs. One year after the initial measurements, 29 percent of the seedlings and 13 percent of the sprouts were dead. Each of the seedling means (number of stems/individual, height and diameter of the tallest stem, and elliptical crown area) was significantly smaller (P < 0.05) than that of sprouts at all three measurement periods, bur relative growth rates were similar. Total canopy area of seedlings had a larger relative increase than did the canopy area of sprouts. The presence of seedlings increased species diversity compared to calculated diversity excluding seedlings. Timing of fruit dispersal in relation to the dare of burning and the high number of Leguminosae species in the forest appeared to favor seedling establishment for some species.

AB Physical disturbance, such as falling debris, is an important cause of mortality to rain forest seedlings. I used artificial seedlings to quantify physical disturbance in a rain forest at the Crater Mountain Biological Research Station in Papua New Guinea. Single (N = 418) and clustered artificial seedlings (N = 428) were placed on eight transects spanning varied topography to assess the area's disturbance regime, to test if ground slope affected disturbance, and to test if clustering affected the incidence of damage.
   Two transects showed a significant departure from random in the spatial distribution of damaged seedlings within the transect, suggesting chat some areas of experience more disturbance than others. Artificial seedlings on level ground experienced damage less often than artificial seedlings on slopes; disturbance increased with ground slope. Artificial seedlings in dry washes experienced the greatest probability of damage. Artificial seedlings in clusters experienced significantly less damage than single ones, suggesting clustered seedlings might be less vulnerable to damage than lone seedlings. The disturbance rate at this sire (34.7% damaged in one year) was markedly lower than that measured at the La Selva Biological Reserve in Costa Rica (82.4%).

AB In southwestern Mexico, the number of new cladodes on Opuntia excelsa was a skewed bell-shaped function of size ("size" being the number of cladodes persisting from previous years). Fruit number was a sigmoidal function of size, but the number of seeds per fruit was independent of number of fruits per plant. The curves for production of new cladodes and of fruits both showed maximum increase for plants with 150-350 cladodes, when the crowns were reaching or in the canopy. New cladode production declined at about the size where reproduction plateaued; we suggest this was due to limitation of crown dimensions by mechanical and physiological factors.

AB Several characteristics of flowers and fruits have been suggested as comprising syndromes of characters that indicate particular classes of pollinators and fruit dispersers. Common phylogenetic history among species, however, may also significantly influence these characters and obscure or enhance perceived patterns of plant syndromes. We analyzed the proportions of glucose, fructose, and sucrose by paper chromatography in the nectar and fruit juice of 525 tropical and subtropical plant species to test whether sugar chemistry was correlated with volant vertebrate pollinator or fruit disperser classes. Samples were taken from Old World and New World species and the calculations kept separate. Kruskal-Wallis tests of family means showed significant deviations in the percent sucrose content among pollinator/disperser classes. Mann-Whitney U-tests showed significant differences among nectars of all pollinator classes but fruit juices differed only due to the high sucrose content of megachiropteran dispersed fruits. In addition, sign tests of samples occurring within families showed significant correlations between percentage sucrose content and pollinator/disperser classes. Passerine nectars had low sucrose content. In striking contrast, the nectar of hummingbird flowers had very high sucrose content. The Microchiroptera nectars showed hexose richness with a sucrose content somewhat greater than that of passerine flowers. Megachiroptera flowers showed sucrose-rich nectars. The results for fruits were comparable to those for nectars. Passerine fruits were hexose dominated, microchiropteran fruits had a sucrose content similar to passerine fruits, and megachiropteran Fruits were sucrose-rich. We speculate on the evolutionary sequence of changes in nectar and fruit juice sugar composition and suggest that future investigations consider the chemistry of other food sources such as pollen and leaves. Only with these additions and other ecological studies can the full interplay of such plane-animal interactions be anticipated.

AB Polymorphic allozyme loci were used to estimate outcrossing rates for three tree species from a disturbed dry forest in southern Costa Rica. Estimates of the multilocus outcrossing rates of Cedrela odorata and Jacaranda copaia were 0.969 and 0.982, respectively, and suggest that these species may be self-incompatible. The subcanopy tree Stemmadenia donnell-smithii also demonstrated little self-fertilization based on an estimated outcrossing rate of 0.896. Significant heterogeneity in pollen allele frequencies among maternal trees was detected for at least two enzyme loci for each species. A test of correlated mating between progeny of S. donnell-smithii revealed that all seeds within a fruit were singly sired. In addition, the low estimates of biparental inbreeding and significant differences in pollen and ovule allele frequencies for this species suggest that gene how into the sampled forest fragment may occur. The implications of deforestation on the mating systems of these tropical tree taxa are discussed.

AB Euterpe edulis flowers at the beginning of the wet season and fruits over an ext ended period during the end of the wet season and the dry season. Reproductive planes produced an average of ca 1500 fruits within a season. Five species of birds belonging to the family Turdidae were observed to feed on and disperse the fruits. Most seeds fell directly to the ground, where there was some subsequent local dispersal by water. The dispersion of seeds was highly clumped with most seeds being found in close proximity to adult plants; the distance of dispersal could be described by a negative power curve. Germination was higher on wetter soils. The probability of seedlings advancing to the next size class within a year was inversely related to the density of seedlings, and occurred optimally at ca 4 m from adult plants. The latter observation indicates that the survival and growth of seedlings are suppressed in the immediate vicinity of conspecific adults.

AB Although large seeds might be more attractive and apparent to seed predators, large seed size could enable tolerance of seed predators. If seeds are large enough to sustain damage that would kill smaller seeds yet still produce viable seedlings, investment above the minimum by the maternal plant could be advantageous. I tested this hypothesis by removing 0-80 percent of the cotyledons of four large-seeded (4-180 g) tree species from Papua New Guinea and monitoring germination and seedling growth for eight months. All species showed little negative effect on seedling size with up to 50 percent removal of cotyledons and the larger species showed a less serious effect on growth than smaller-seeded species above 50 percent removal. Large-seeded species clearly have more than the minimum-required cotyledonary reserves. Observations of viable seedlings with heavily damaged cotyledons suggest that these species withstand attack by rodents and beetles by virtue of their large size.

AB Miconia calvescens DC (Melastomataceae) is a dominant invasive species in the tropical oceanic island of Tahiti (French Polynesia, South Pacific Ocean), where it was introduced as an ornamental plant. Whereas this small tree is sparse in its native range of Central America, it has spread in Tahiti into a wide variety of habitats including native wet forests. The remarkable success of this invasion is due in great part to prolife reproduction: a mature tree can bear up to 220 inflorescences with an average of 1330 flowers/inflorescence, 208 fruits/infructescence and 195 seeds/fruit. Two and a half years of phenological observations in a highly invaded site indicated that three major peaks of flowering occur/year over brief periods: flower anthesis lasted a few days and pollen grain germination suggested a short stigmatic receptivity of only a few hours; no pollinators were observed foraging on flowers during our survey; the production of fruits containing viable seeds in bagged inflorescences showed that self-fertilization can occur; pollen-ovule ratio (log P/O = 2.68) suggested facultative xenogamy; bagged isolated flowers to test for autogamy and style cutting to learn whether apomixis occured or not were not conclusive. The flowering phenology and the breeding system of M. calvescens enable this plant to build up rapidly successful populations from even a single propagule on the island of Tahiti and on other sires of introduction The vegetation structure of Polynesian native forests compared to Neotropical rain forests probably plays an important role in determining the reproductive success of M, calvescens and could provide a complementary explanation of the biological invasion processes in tropical oceanic islands.

AB The distribution, habitat association, group size, population structure, and prey availability of river dolphins (Inia geoffrensis) were studied from November 1993-June 1994 in the Cinaruco River, a tributary of the Orinoco River that forms the southern boundary of Venezuela's Santos Luzardo National Park. Dolphins were sampled from a boat using modified strip-width transects, for a total of 418 h. The study area was 1.67 km(2), and contained 20 km of water courses. Like other rivers of this region, the Cinaruco River undergoes a seasonal flood cycle. Dolphins were seen most often during the period of falling water (41% of coral sightings) and lease often during the rising water period (24% of coral sightings). Dolphins were seen most often in confluence areas (35% of total sightings) and were seldom seen in side channels (13% of total sightings). The presence of rocks or sandbanks was associated with a greater frequency of dolphin sightings, and sightings increased with habitat heterogeneity. Average group size for the 8-mo study was 2.0 (+/- 1.0) and was largest during the rising water period. Caves were first sighted during the end of the dry season and became more common during the early hood season. Six individuals were photo-identified and resighted with one sighted eight times over 186 d. The fish diversity of the study area was high, with 161 species documented in our samples. The stomach of one Inia contained 15 fishes representing at least 4 species.

AB Male-specific associations of adult froghoppers (Homoptera: Cercopidae) with alternative food plane hosts is reported. Four accounts from the field and one from the literature are presented: Iphirhina quota on Boirreria costaricensis (Boraginaceae), Huaina inca on Solanaceae sp., Prosapia simulans and Prosapia sp. (near P. bicincta) on Ilex haberi (Aquifoliaceae), and Prosapia bicincta on Ilex cornuta and Ilex opaca. In three cases host use is limited to adults while in two cases use is limited to only adult males. In four cases adults feed on plants that differ taxonomically, structurally and ecologically from hosts normally utilized by all life stages. These associations are not considered aggregations per se because froghoppers are not clustered and because these associations cannot be explained by the usual criteria supporting the adaptiveness of insect aggregations. Indirect evidence suggests that these unusual hosts may be unavailable to nymphs and not sought by females. This passive lack of opportunity by nymphs and females, in tandem with an active selection/attraction by males, is a plausible explanation for the existence of male-specific hosts.

AB We studied avian resource use in a native West Indian pine (Pinus occidentalis) forest in the Cordillera Central of the Dominican Republic during the nonbreeding season. The forest is characterized by a fairly open pine canopy and a dense mixed-broadleaf and pine understory. We used a principal components analysis of 23 foraging characters for 23 bird species, including foraging height, the proportional use of 5 different foraging methods, 3 horizontal positions and foliage densities, and 11 foraging substrates. Five principal components accounted for 74 percent of the total variance of the assemblage variables and resulted in the delineation of at least 5 foraging guilds. 78 percent of bird species had mean foraging heights of 5.0-10.0 m, corresponding to the region of overlap of pine and broadleaf vegetation. As a result, the diversity of foraging substrates and maneuvers used by birds, rather than foraging height, appears to be the primary means by which birds that exploit this habitat separate ecologically. Migrant wood warblers (Parulinae) are probably able to integrate into the community because of little diet overlap between residents and migrants, and the fairly specialized nature of their largely insectivorous foraging habits. Avian foraging in this habitat may reflect the effects of frequent disturbance such as hurricanes.

Dictyostelium purpureum was the single most abundant species and represented almost half (48%) of all clones isolated during the study. Total densities (clones/g) averaged only 38 in the five forest types examined, bur densities > 75 were recorded for two forest types. Relative abundance of CSM in canopy soils of the five forest types followed the same general pattern displayed by these organisms in forest floor litter, bur a particular species was not necessarily common to both microhabitats in a given forest type.

AB An earlier study suggested that soils on the windward slope of Mount Haleakala are excessively waterlogged at low altitudes but become better drained upslope. We analyzed altitudinal changes in soil N turn over, vegetation mass, and foliar chemical composition of the dominant canopy species, Metrosideros polymorpha (Myrtaceae), on this slope. The basal areas and DBH2 X height (an index for volume) of woody species greater than or equal to 2 m in height increased with altitude (as opposed to a general trend elsewhere), peaked at 1800 m elev., and abruptly declined above this altitude. Foliar N and P concentrations of Metrosideros showed a similar altitudinal trend with DBH2 X height values. Foliar Fe and Al concentrations steadily increased downslope, but were low again at 450 m, the lowest altitude, contrary to expectation based on waterlogging. Toxic forms of Fe and Al may retard root penetration in waterlogged soils and thus the uptake of these elements. The net N mineralization rare for topsoils incubated in situ was 78.6 mu g/g/20d at 1800 m elev., while small amounts of N were immobilized at 450, 1200 and 2200 m elev. The net N mineralization rates of the topsoils, which were air-dried to their permanent. wilting points and incubated at 26 degrees C, were greater than those of the wet samples at 26 degrees C, only for the lowest altitude. Conversely, the net N mineralization rates of the topsoils which were kept wet and incubated at the higher temperature of 26 degrees C were greater (P < 0.1) than those of the in situ wet samples only for 1800 m elev. The rates were the same for 450 and 2200 m elev, where the soils were waterlogged and very dry, respectively; thus, N turn over was more strongly limited by moisture than by temperature in these cases. Nutrient availability improved with altitude up to 1800 m elev, in association with the moisture gradient, and appeared to be responsible for the observed pattern in vegetation mass.

ID TREE MORTALITY
AB Long-term studies are needed to understand the dynamics of tropical forests, particularly those subject to periodic disturbances such as hurricanes. We studied a flood plain Prestoea montana palm forest in the Luquillo Mountains of Puerto Rico over a 15-yr period (1980-1995), which included the passage of Hurricane Hugo in September 1989. The passage of the hurricane caused the dominant species to become more dominant and created low instantaneous tree mortality (1% of stems) and reductions in tree biomass (-16 Mg/ha/yr) and density, although not in basal area. Five years after the hurricane, the palm flood plain forest had exceeded its prehurricane aboveground tree biomass, tree density, and basal area. Aboveground tree biomass accumulated at a rate of 9.2 Mg/ha/yr, 76 percent of which was due to palms. Before the hurricane this rate was on the order of 3 Mg/ha/yr. Forest floor litter decreased to prehurricane levels (6.7 Mg/ha), within 5 yr, mostly due to the disappearance of woody litter. Thirteen tree species not represented in the canopy entered the forest by regeneration, and 2 species suffered almost 20 percent/yr mortality over a 5-yr period after the storm (floodplain average of 2%/yr). Delayed tree mortality was twice as high as instantaneous tree mortality after the storm and affected dicotyledonous trees more than it did palms. Regeneration of dicotyledonous trees, palms, and tree ferns was influenced by a combination of factors including hydroperiod, light, and space. Redundancy Data Analysis showed that the area near the river channel was the most favorable for plant regeneration. Palm regeneration was higher in locations with longer hydroperiods, while regeneration of dicotyledonous trees was higher in areas with low risk of flooding. This study shows how a periodic disturbance provides long-term opportunities for species invasions and long-term ecosystem response at the patch scale of <1 ha.

AB There are a variety of ways to diminish the negative impacts of forest management for timber on biodiversity. A pilot project using a uniform spacing method of selective cutting was recently implemented in the 5340 ha Guarani Reserve, Misiones, Argentina, to design adequate management schemes for the subtropical forests of the region. Uniform spacing involves moderate timber harvesting and careful selection of remnant frees. In this article we compare tree regeneration in forests experimentally cut by diameter limit and uniform spacing methods. Seedlings of five size classes from 10 cm to 3 m in height were sampled using rectangular nested plots. Three years after cutting, an average of 54,330 and 22,270 seedling/ha (all height classes combined) of commercial and non-commercial species were found in the forest cut by uniform spacing and by minimum diameter, respectively In an adjacent uncut forest there were 34,900 seedlings/ha, and in another forest cut by minimum diameters 30 years ago there were 50,000 seedlings/ha. The forest cut by uniform spacing had the highest number of commercial seedlings/ha, with three times as many as the forest cut by minimum diameter three years ago and twice as many as the forest treated by minimum diameters 30 years ago. The forest cut by uniform spacing and the forest treated by minimum diameters 30 years ago had the highest diversity of understory plants other than trees, as well as heterogeneous canopy cover, while the other two forests had a predominance of bamboo in the understory and more open canopy conditions. Although lack of site replication limits interpretation of the results, these early findings suggest that the uniform spacing method can be an ecologically sound forest management option for the region.

AB The interrelationships between the distribution of woody species and environmental variables were investigated in an area of deciduous dry forest in Santa Vitoria, central Brazil. This is the first study of a vanishing type of dry forest which grows on base-rich soils originating from the basalt bedrocks of southern Goias and western Minas Gerais. A survey of topography, soil properties, canopy gaps and woody plants (greater than or equal to 5 cm diameter at the base of the stem) was conducted in 50-15 x 15 m quadrats. The soils were classified into the following soil series: Hapludolls --> Haplustolls --> Ustropepts --> Rhodustalfs. This series corresponded ro a gradient of increasing elevation and effective soil depth and decreasing slope gradient, soil organic matter and total exchangeable bases. A canonical correspondence analysis and a detrended correspondence analysis indicated that plant species' abundance distribution was significantly correlated with both the relative area of canopy gaps in the quadrats and the soil-topography gradient. Presumably, the critical factors involved in these two gradients are, respectively light and ground water regimes. The influence of canopy gaps (i.e., light) was surprising and has nor been documented previously for tropical deciduous dry forests.

AB Seasonal changes in tropical forests are difficult to measure from the ground, especially in areas of high species diversity and low phenological synchrony. Satellite images, which integrate individual tree canopies and cover a large spatial extent, facilitate rests for stand-level canopy phenology. Variability in near-infrared radiance (TM bands 4 and 5) of several distinct vegetation types was used to detect seasonal changes in a series of three Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images from the wet season co the dry season in Maraba, Brazil (eastern Amazon basin). Despite different atmospheric and instrumental conditions among the images, spectral changes were distinguishable. A phenological process (leaf aging, leaf drop, water stress) was determined from the spectral changes for each vegetation type. Changes in the spectral properties suggest that during the dry season, upland terra firme forest increased the race of leaf exchange and some riparian vegetation was deciduous. Terra firme forest that had been altered by penetration of fires from nearby pastures increased in leaf biomass over a 14-month period. This study shows that a time series of images can provide information on temporal changes in primary vegetation and guide field studies to investigate seasonal changes that may not be detectable from the ground.

AB The distribution patterns of Adiantum species were inventoried at twelve noninundated rain Forest (tierra firme) sites in Amazonian Peru and Ecuador. Six species belonging to the genus were found, and four of these were abundant at some of the sites. At six of the sites none of the species was particularly abundant. Both the occurrence and the abundance of the species varied among sires with regard to soil texture and concentration of exchangeable bases and within sites with regard to topography. Adiantum tomentosum Klotzsch was restricted to loamy soils with intermediate to low content of extractable bases and was locally most abundant in the well drained parts of slopes and ridge tops. Adiantum terminatum Kunze ex Miq. and A. humile Kunze occurred at sites with intermediate to high content of extractable bases, but their relative abundances differed among and within sires, Adiantum pulverulentum L. was restricted to soils with relatively high base concentration. Ecological differences among the species obviously explained many of the differences in their distribution patterns at the local and regional scales, and may be important for the understanding of such patterns at biogeographical scales as well.

AB The effect of canopy closure on spatial and morphological patterns of three understory Chusquea species was studied in pristine upper montane oak forests. Plots with either Chusquea talamancensis Widmer & L.G. Clark or C. tomentosa Widmer & L.G. Clark were set our in gaps, under intermediate tree canopy and under closed canopy. The third species Chusquea foliosa L.G. Clark was only found in gap and intermediate canopy sites in the study area. Clumps of all bamboo species tend to be few and large under open conditions and numerous and small under more shady conditions. The larger size of dumps in gaps is reflected in the number of culms per clump, the diameter of the culms and, as a consequence, clump basal area, dump crown area, and biomass (index of plane volume) compared to intermediate and closed canopy. The smaller dump density in gaps compared to closed canopy implies that there is more intraspecific competition and density dependent mortality (self-thinning effect) when a bamboo species is dominant under favourable light conditions. Parameters of performance like culm length, number of nodes per culm, number and length of primary branches, and number of branch nodes seem not to be affected by the light regime, unlike total number of branches, total branch length, and the branching pattern. Species differ in their response to the light environment: C. tomentosa and C. foliosa have a higher degree of morphological plasticity than C. talamancensis, which in turn, appears to be more shade tolerant. No difference between species has been found regarding their contribution to vegetation, parameters reflecting abundance per unit area (site clump area, site crown area and site index of clump volume) were similar for all three species.

AB Hurricane disturbance may have strong effects on plant-animal interactions important in plant reproductive success. Components of reproductive success (flowering, pollination, seed predation) in the tropical shrub Ardisia escallonioides (Myrsinaceae) were examined from 1991-1994 in four southern Florida populations. Hurricane Andrew struck three of the four populations on 24 August 1992. Hurricane Andrew delayed flowering by two months in 1992. In 1993 and 1994, the three hurricane-damaged populations had increased flowering and inflorescence production compared to 1991 and 1992, while the undamaged population had no flowering.
   Hurricane disturbance had different effects on generalist versus specialist plant-animal interactions. Species composition and relative abundance of the generalist pollinator community that visits A. escallonioides was similar before and after the hurricane, indicating little effect of the disturbance on this interaction. In contrast, populations of a specialist flower galling moth (Periploca sp., Cosmopterigidae) declined in 1992 following Hurricane Andrew. Although moth populations increased at two of the three sites in 1993, the relative impact of moth predation on seed production was low due to extensive flower production. One moth population suffered local population extirpation for two years, reestablishing itself in November 1994. Hurricane disturbance resulted in a window of opportunity for massive seed production of Ardisia escallonioides in south Florida. Total seed production in 1993 increased twelve to seventy-three times the 1992 levels. Total seed production declined in 1994, but remained high compared to prehurricane levels.

AB In the unique fauna assemblage of the Malagasy rain forest, lemurs appear to play particularly important roles as seed-dispersing frugivores. A three-month study of feeding ecology and seed dispersal by four species of lemurs in Madagascar's eastern rain forest found that three species, Eulemur rubriventer, Eulemur fulvus, and Varecia variegata were seed dispersers, and the fourth, Propithecus diadema, was a seed predator. In germination trials, seeds passed by lemurs sprouted significantly faster and in greater numbers than those not passed by lemurs. Analysis of fruit morphologies of 69 local plant taxa producing fleshy fruits during the study period found that these fruits fell into two well-defined color categories that correlated significantly with fruit size. Seventy seven percent of fleshy fruits greater than 10 mm in diameter were colored green, brown, tan, purplish, or black, while all fruits less than 10 mm in diameter were colored red, yellow, orange, pink, blue, or white. Three introduced exotic plant species provided exceptions to this pattern, producing fruits which were larger than 10 mm and pink or orange. Fruits chosen by the primates in this study were usually larger than 10 mm in diameter and were in nearly all cases colored green, brown, tan, purplish, red, or some combination of these colors. Morphological traits shared by fruits of multiple plant taxa in the diets of seed-dispersing lemurs suggest possible coevolved relationships between Malagasy rain forest plants and lemurs.

AB Fungal pathogens that infect reproductive structures of plants (e.g., flowers and fruits) can reduce the seed production and seedling recruitment of host plants. We report here on the effects of a rust, Aecidium farameae that infects the ovaries and pedicels of mature flowers on Faramea occidentalis (Rubiaceae), a small tree common on Barro Colorado Island, Republic of Panama. Rust infection of ovaries reduced the number of maturing fruit on infected trees. Trees with low rust incidence in June of 1992 had 68 percent fruit survival, compared to 17 percent fruit survival for those with high rust incidence. Infected fruits developed abnormally and were usually aborted long before uninfected fruits were mature. One hundred percent of the infected ovaries marked in July were diseased or missing in August. We conclude that infection by A. farameae has the potential to seriously decrease the reproductive output of Faramea occidentalis and may represent an important source of variation in the relative fitness of individual plants.

AB This paper reports thrips (Thysanoptera) cross-pollination in the primitive angiosperm, Popowia pisocarpa (Annonaceae), in lowland rain forest of Sarawak, Malaysia. Flowers of P. pisocarpa have a tiny pollination chamber (3-4 mm in depth) with the entrance almost dosed by the disk-shaped stigmatic herds, allowing only small insects to enter. Experiments showed that thrips were effective pollinators and flowers of P. pisocarpa were self-incompatible. Seed set was limited by pollen. Clumped adult trees had higher seed-set than mote distant individuals (>5 m from nearest flowering neighbor), indicating limited inter-tree movement by thrips.

AB We compared bird diversity and frequency in selection logged and unlogged forest to determine the effects of recent selection logging on avian biodiversity in a subtropical, moist evergreen forest. We used a combination of mist netting and fixed-radius point counts to assess bird communities in February and March 1993 in northwestern Belize. Vegetation structure and composition was similar in logged and unlogged forest. The 66 most common species occurred with statistically similar frequency in logged and unlogged forest although 13 species were two times more frequent in intact forest. Numbers of total bird species were similar between logging gaps and the logged forest matrix, and between the logged forest matrix and unlogged forests. A comparison of numbers of species in 26 guilds based on migration strategy, diet, foraging substrate, and height strata also showed them to be similar regardless of logging history. Our results differed from previous studies that reported lower bird species richness and abundance of individual species in logged tropical forests than in unlogged forest. The differences might be explained by the lower logging intensity and/or greater levels of natural disturbance in our study area compared to previous studies.

AB Two white-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari) herds were radio-tracked for 5 and 13 mo, respectively on Maraca Island Ecological Reserve, Roraima, Brazil. Home range size was 109.6 km(2) for the larger herd (130 animals) and 21.8 km(2) for the smaller herd (53 animals). Neither herd migrated or moved nomadically during the study period. The herd with the longer observation period increased its home range size during the flooded season by including new sites not used in the nonflooded season and continuing to use the nonflooded season sites. This pattern of simultaneously using distinct seasonal ranges also occurred between the rainy and dry periods and the herd regularly and predictably returned to favored feeding sites. Population declines and disappearances in this study and others may have been caused by in situ mortality rather than by long-distance movements.

AB One common class of ant-plant mutualism involves ants that defend plants from natural enemies in return for food and sometimes shelter. Studies of these interactions have played a major role in shaping our broad understanding of mutualism. Their central contribution has come via their development of approaches to measuring the benefits, costs, and net outcomes of mutualism, and their explicit consideration of variability in all of these phenomena. Current research on these interactions is suggesting ecological and evolutionary hypotheses that may be applicable to many other forms of mutualism. It is also generating comparative data for testing the few general theories about mutualism that currently exist.

AB Top-predator (fourth-trophic-level) controlled trophic cascades are thought to be uncommon in terrestrial systems, but actual quantitative tests and comparisons of bottom-up and top-down Forces in systems with more than three linear trophic levels are rare. Here, we describe the density patterns of the archropod community associated with Piper ant-planes in Costa Rican wet forests. Consumers in this community comprise a complex, interacting web of herbivores, predaceous ants, and predators of ants. Although the hollow stems and petioles of the Piper plants provide some protection to resident ants from predation, specialized Dipoena spiders and Phyllobaenus beetles exploit Pheidole ants inhabiting Piper plants. We report abundance patterns of plants, ants and predators in four forests. These patterns of abundance are consistent with predictions of top-down cascades across four trophic levels when the top predators are effective (beetles). We discuss how top-down and bottom-up forces may interact in systems with less effective top predators (spiders).

AB We surveyed the material collected For fungus culturing by attine ants in the cerrado vegetation of southeast Brazil. Six genera of the so-called lower attines (Cyphomyrmex, Mycetarotes, Mycocepurus, Myrmicocrypta, Sericomyrmex and Trachymyrmex) collect a wide variety of plant material as fungal substrate. Plant diaspores of nonmyrmecochorous species comprise a large portion of the items brought to the nest, especially in the rainy season. Removal experiments using fruits of selected plant species revealed that attine ants (including the leaf-cutters Atta and Acromyrmex) not only actively clean the seeds (remove fruit pulp), but also carry them up to 12 m in the cerrado. Germination tests showed that removal of fruit pulp by attine ants increases germination rate in Ocotea pulchella (Lauraceae), Prunus sellowii (Rosaceae), Ouratea specrabilis (Ochnaceae), Rapanea umbellata (Myrsinaceae) and Psychotria stachyoides (Rubiaceae). For P. stachyoides, however, ants had no effect on germination if seeds had already passed the digestive tract of birds. Aril removal by attines also increases germination success of Copaifera langsdorffii (Leguminosae) and Virola sebifera (Myristicaceae) seeds. The results indicate that attine-fruit/seed interactions are particularly conspicuous in the cerrado, suggesting that fungus-growing ants may play a relevant role in fruit/seed biology in this vegetation type. potential ant-derived benefits to diaspores of nonmyrmecochorous plants in the cerrado would include secondary seed dispersion and/or increased germination success by ant-handled seeds.

AB We observed nectar use by native and exotic ant species in nature, garden, and urban situations, and found ants utilizing floral and extrafloral nectar of a variety of flowering plant species. We collected 31 plant nectars (29 floral, 2 extrafloral) and used them in feeding preference rests against standard solutions of sugars (20 percent fructose, glucose, and sucrose, and their mixture), 10 trials for each nectar-ant comparison. We compared time-to-discovery and coral ant visits to each droplet using ANOVA, and found that both trial and solution contributed significantly to the variation in most experiments. Seven of the floral nectars tested were significantly more attractive to certain ant species than the sugar solutions. Not only do ants use floral nectar, bur it appears that some floral nectars contain compounds that are especially attractive to ants.

AB The richness and seasonal variation of ant-plant interactions were compared in four habitats in Mexico: lowland tropical dry forest (La Mancha, Veracruz), coastal sand dune matorra (San Benito, Yucatan), semiarid highland vegetation (Zapotitlan, Puebla), and lower montane humid forest (Xalapa, Veracruz). The effects of temperature and precipitation on the seasonal distribution of the number of ant-plant interactions differed among habitats. The general linear models fitted to the ant-plant interaction curves explained 78.8 percent of the variation for La Mancha, 80.1 percent for Zapotitlan, 18 percent for San Benito, and 29.5 percent for Xalapa. Even though rainfall is low in Zapotitlan and San Benito, minimum temperature was the most important factor accounting for the seasonal distribution and low number of interactions. At La Mancha, with milder minimum temperatures and higher water availability, temperature alone did nor account for the seasonal distribution and number of interactions, whereas the effect of the precipitation X temperature interaction was highly significant. Xalapa exhibits the lowest temperatures and the highest precipitation, but the role of these factors was only marginal. We suggest that the vegetation at Xalapa, a mixture of tropical and temperate floristic elements, constrains ant-plant interactions due to a limited presence of nectaries. Also, ants are less abundant in cool and relatively aseasonal habitats. The other habitats have tropical floristic elements that are abundant and frequently have nectar-producing structures. We report considerable variation among habitats in the number and seasonal distribution of ant-plane interactions, and suggest that it is due to the effect of variation in environmental parameters, the richness of plants with nectaries in the vegetation, and habitat heterogeneity.

AB Striking variation in ant occupation of a facultative ant-plant, Conostegia serosa (Melastomataceae), was found at three scales: local spatial, geographic, and temporal. C. setosa provides housing for ants and grows in groups of stems (clones). The ant occupants of 14 C. setosa clones were censused four times over a 14-mo period at the La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica, and twice over a 9-mo period at the Nusagandi Station, Panama. Twelve facultative ant species occupied C. setosa stems at La Selva, compared to six facultative and one obligate species at Nusagandi. Occupancy (as % of stems ever occupied/clone) was higher at Nusagandi (median = 89%) compared to La Selva (65%). Occupancy varied among clones at La Selva bur nor at Nusagandi. C. serosa clones differed between sires, with larger clones and more small stems/clone at La Selva. Occupancy was influenced by clone structure; larger clones contained more ant species at both sites and had lower occupancy at La Selva. Occupancy was highest in larger stems and lowest in small stems at both sires. Temporally percent occupation/clone did nor differ among censuses at either site, but overall occupancy was lower in the dry season at La Selva. Turnover in ant occupants was higher at La Selva than at Nusagandi. The variation observed in this study is likely due to a number of factors, including differences between sites in plant population structure and history, differences between and within sites in ant faunas and their nesting requirements, and changes over space and time in microclimatic variables. Such high variation at multiple scales draws attention to the importance of long-term comparative studies of facultative animal-plant interactions.

AB Despite the importance of the soil seed bank in tropical forest regeneration, little is known about spatial variability in species composition and abundance of seeds stored in the soil. To develop sampling methods For comparative studies, we examined species richness, spatial variation, and abundance of germinants from the soil seed bank in a 16 year old secondary, tropical wet forest at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. Surface soil (10 cm deep, 4.7 cm diameter) was collected at the intersection points of a gridded 1 ha plot (10 x 10-m grid, 121 samples) and in a nested 100 m(2) subplot (2 x 2-m grid, 36 samples). The 1 ha plot had a density of 4535 seeds/m(2) with 34 species observed. Based on a series of 100 randomized species accumulation curves, a Michaelis-Menten fit predicted a mean species richness of 36.3 species; the number of observed species was close to the predicted asymptote. A nonparametric, first-order jackknife species richness estimator predicted a species richness of 37.0 species. Eighty-five and 95 percent of the observed species richness is contained, on average, within 41 and 74 pooled samples, respectively. Within the 100 m2 nested subplot, a density of 5476 seeds/m(2) was observed, comprising 26 species with an estimated species richness (Michaelis-Menten fit) of 29.1 species. The jackknife species richness estimator predicted a species richness of 36.7 species. For species richness and abundance of both plots, spacial autocorrelation statistics (Moran's I) were not significantly different from zero at lag distances from 2 to 100 m, indicating a random distribution at these spatial scales. For this sire, accurate estimates of species composition depend upon the number of samples collected as well as the spatial distribution of sampling effort. Many small samples distributed over a large area provide greater accuracy and precision for estimating species richness of the soil seed bank.

AB To investigate long-term effects of land use on the soil seed bank, we compared the abundance/density, species richness, life form distribution, and species composition of seeds stored in the soil of four 15-20 yr-old second-growth stands, two old-growth stands, and two previously selectively-logged stands in the Caribbean lowlands of Costa Rice. Surface soil (10 cm deep, 4.7 cm diameter) was collected at 10 m intervals along three 120-160 m long transects in each stand (44-48 soil cores, 22-24 combined seed bank samples per site). Seed density was highest but variable in second-growth stands (8331-14535 seeds/m(2)), low and homogeneous in old-growth stands (2258-2659 seeds/m(2)), and intermediate and highly variable in selectively-logged stands (1165-6854 seeds/m(2)), which also had contrasting logging intensities. Species richness was strongly dependent on seed density, but showed less variation. Life form distribution did not differ statistically among or within land-use categories. In each stand, herbs-forbs, shrubs, and vines dominated the seed bank (> 75% of the species richness and abundance), whereas trees were a minor component (< 20% of the species richness and < 5% of the abundance) and were predominantly early successional. Shrubs and vines were most abundant in second-growth stands where regrowth vegetation was repeatedly cut before abandonment, whereas grasses and sedges were most abundant in the only forest stand that was completely surrounded by pastures. In terms of species composition, old-growth stands were more similar to selectively-logged stands than to second-growth stands, bur across stands, selectively-logged forests were most distinct from the other two forest types. An inventory of the standing woody vegetation in each site showed little representation of the woody taxa found in the seed bank. We discuss these results in the context of the main factors that have been postulated to influence the abundance, life form, and species composition of tropical forest seed banks, and explore the role of the latter during intermediate phases of tropical forest succession and regeneration.

AB We examined the typhoon wind disturbance regime of the Fu-Shan Experimental Forest in northeastern Taiwan. Mean number of typhoons passing within 200 kilometers of Taipei (40 kilometers from the site) was 1.4 per year. Category 4 and 5 typhoons, which are intense enough to uproot large numbers of trees, occurred every 8.3 and 12.5 years respectively, although it is likely that some category 4 and 5 typhoons did not produce extensive blowdowns at Fu-Shan because the area of maximum winds missed the study site. Uprooting was more common than snapped boles; the most common damage to trees, however, was probably defoliation, although this damage was not quantified in the current study Thirty-live percent of wind-damaged trees were associated with a gap. Six percent of the land area was in gaps. Canopy turnover time was calculated at 175 years when all gaps less than or equal to 9 years old were included in the calculation, but the time decreased when older gaps were excluded from the calculation. Turnover time was somewhat higher than calculated for other tropical forests. Because turnover time increases as the percent of land in gaps decreases, the short life span of gaps at Fu-Shan probably contributed to our higher calculated time. Probability of being damaged was not related to tree species identity, and only a few species of trees were found regenerating in gaps. Principal Components Analysis indicated that damaged trees varied largely in treefall orientation and aspect; gaps varied primarily in aspect and in gap size.

AB Using a 0.78 ha transect in an undisturbed forest in French Guiana, we sought a typology of forest mosaic units (5 x 5 m quadrats) based on diameter distribution with three main classes of trees greater than or equal to 5 cm DBH. We identified nine basic structural types corresponding to potential stages of a sequence of development from colonization of gaps to filling of the vertical space among three layers. Two enumerations made over a 10-year interval (1981 and 1991), enabled a transition matrix to be estimated. This summarizes movement between structural types over the period and enables ideas on dynamics to be discussed.

AB Mycorrhizal fungi were sampled in a deciduous tropical forest on the Pacific coast of Mexico during different seasons and in natural treefall gaps and pastures. All 12 plant species sampled in the forest were arbuscular mycorrhizal. The percent root infection and spore production were closely related to the phenology of the plants. Most tree species and all herbaceous species had the highest infection in the summer rainy season, bur two species, Opuntia excelsa and Jacquinia pungens, had highest infection in the dry season. Unusually high rainfall during the dry season was associated with increased infection bur not increased spore production. Spore density was low for all species at all sample times, except at the beginning of the July 1993 rainy season in, when we observed up to 28 spores/g soil.
   The percent cover of shrubs or herbs did nor increase in gaps after two years, and we observed no colonizing seedlings. No plane species with cover higher than 2.7 percent occurred exclusively in gaps or forest. The percent mycorrhizal infection did nor differ significantly between gaps and forest. Spore counts were as high in the gaps as in the forest in two of the three gaps but lower in the third gap. The lack of significant response of plants in these gaps after two years differed from the rapid response in tropical rainforests. it is likely related to the small size of the gaps and to light infiltration to the forest floor. Pastures were dominated by two species of exotic grasses and one species of mycorrhizal fungus, whereas forests had lj fungal species. The slow regrowth of vegetation in gaps was not limited by mycorrhiza fungi, since they were still abundant after the treefalls, bur recovery in pastures could be affected by low fungal diversity and dominance of grasses.

AB The light environment within forests presents complex patterns of brightness and spectral distribution of light. The polarized light field is no less complex. Using an imaging polarized light analyzer, we examined the natural fields of linearly polarized light in the tropical rain forest of Guatopo National Park, Venezuela. We found that the celestial polarization pattern remains visible underneath the forest canopy, although cloud and fog coverage may diffuse the light and reduce the polarization signal. We characterized several distinct light environments, each having a characteristic polarized light field. Furthermore, objects throughout the forest reflect light that is polarized in a predictable fashion depending upon the material, structure, and orientation of the reflecting surface. As a consequence of these patterns in the distribution of polarized light, some functions of polarization vision, such as navigation, must be limited to the spaces exposed to several extended portions of the sky, while others, such as remote sensing of surface orientation, object detection, and breaking of camouflage would be useful throughout the forest. The polarization of light adds another dimension to the complexity of the rain forest photic environment.

AB We tested the hypothesis that, where fire has historically been infrequent, wooded areas chat have been invaded by grasses and converted to grassland by fire are predisposed to future fire compared to adjacent areas that remain wooded; thus, an initial forest fire may promote future fires. We compared microclimate between a grass-dominated burned area and a nearby grass-invaded woodland that has not burned in recent history, both located in the submontane dry forest of Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. The results were used to parameterize BEHAVE, a fire behavior prediction model developed by the USDA Forest Service. The model's predictions include probability of ignition, intensity, rate of spread, and tree mortality. Contrary to expectations, daytime hourly mean temperatures were higher and relative humidity was lower in the woodland site. However, the differences in temperature and humidity were not great enough to affect spread rare or probability of ignition. Wind speeds were substantially greater in the grassland, and this was most important in driving differences in modeled fire spread. Given similar synoptic conditions, a fire started in the grassland can be expected to spread an order of magnitude faster than one started in the woodland.

AB There is growing concern about the potential impact of researchers on tropical forest ecology, but few data. The aim of this paper is to examine the effects of collecting botanical specimens from tropical forest trees on their subsequent survivorship, using mortality data from plots in Amazonian Peru that were established in 1989 and reinventoried in 1994. In total, 2017 trees were originally tagged and collections were made from 948 trees. Making voucher collections always involved using unsterilized telescopic plant collecting poles to cut representative small branches, and sometimes also involved using iron-spiked tree-climbing gear to gain access to the canopy. Annual mortality in the Four plots averaged 1.99 percent. Among the whole population of dicotyledenous trees, there was no detectable difference between the mortality rate of collected trees (1.96%) and noncollected trees (2.29%). We conclude chat in spite of the physical damage caused to collected trees, collecting voucher specimens from tropical moist forest trees may not affect their survivorship, at least in the short-term. Further studies are needed to fully evaluate the potential impacts of research activities on permanent forest plots in the tropics.

AB I studied two aspects of interspecific territoriality in a Costa Rican nectarivorous bird, the rufous-tailed hummingbird (Amazilia tzacatl). First, I examined variation in the response of the territory holder to Four species of intruding hummingbirds by quantifying the proportion of intruders chased from the territory This measure of territory defense varied significantly among species of intruders and was negatively related to the intruding species' body mass, possibly due to potential costs associated with becoming involved in escalated contests with larger individuals. Second, I tested for an effect of resource manipulation on territory defense. I increased the resource value of the territory by injecting errant natural flowers with artificial sucrose solution. While the frequency of territorial intrusions did not change, the proportion of intruders chased by the territory holder increased. Apparently, nectar supplementation changed the territory holder's perception of resource value but had little impact on the intruders' perception.

AB Between 4 and 16 January 1996, during a period of cool weather, we studied the emergence and foraging behavior of Molossus ater at a site near Akumal, in the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico. The bats, a colony of at least 32 individuals, roosted in a north-facing cinder block wall, and emerged about sunset. Emerging bats were usuary clustered in time, while those returning usually were not. Radio-cracking revealed that the bars foraged for short periods (mean 26.8 min) and captures of returning individuals indicated that 27 of 28 had fed, taking, on average, 4.4 g of insects, mainly hydrophilid beetles. On some nights, few or none of the radio-ragged bats emerged from the roost. Calculations concerning the costs of flight and roosting show that they were more than covered by the energy intake the bars achieved. Molossus ater have high aspect ratio (8.3-9.1) wings and high wing-loadings of 17.55-24.15 N/m(2). When searching for prey, these bats produce long (12.3 ms), narrowband(3.8 kHz), echolocation calls that sweep from 27.6-23.8 kHz. Energy was not limiting for these bats at the time of our study.

AB Dead wood can be an important component of the carbon pool in many forests, but few measurements have been made of this pool in tropical forests. To fill this gap, we determined the quantity of dead wood (downed and standing dead) in 25 long-term (up to 30 yr) permanent forest plots located in six different life zones of Venezuela. Downed wood was separated into fine (< 10 cm in diameter) and coarse (greater than or equal to 10 cm in diameter) classes, and three decomposition scares (sound, intermediate, or rotten). The total quantity of dead wood, averaged by life zone, was lowest in the dry (2.43 Mg/ha), reached a peak in the moist (42.33 Mg/ha) and decreased slightly in the wet (34.50 Mg/ha) life zone. Most of the dead wood was in the standing dead category (about 42-76% of the total). The decomposition state of dead wood in all plots was mostly rotten (45%) or intermediate (44%); there was little sound wood (11%). Turnover rates of dead wood generally ranged between 0.03/yr to 0.52/yr with no clear trend with life zone. The large amount of dead wood In some plots was equivalent to about 20 percent or less of aboveground biomass, indicating that dead wood can represent a significant amount of carbon in these forests.

AB To understand the ecological roles of epiphytic bryophytes in the carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycles of a tropical montane forest, we used samples in enclosures to estimate rates of growth, net production, and N accumulation by shoots in the canopy, and litterbags, to estimate rates of decomposition and N dynamics of epiphytic bryophyte litter in the canopy and on the forest floor in Monteverde, Costa Rica. Growth of epiphytic bryophytes was estimated at 30.0-49.9 percent/yr, net production at 122-203 g/m(2)/yr, and N accumulation at 1.8-3.0 g N/m(2)/yr. Cumulative mass loss from litterbags after one and two years in the canopy was 17 +/- 2 and 19 +/- 2 percent (mean +/- 1 SE) of initial sample mass, respectively, and mass loss from litter and green shoots in litterbags after one year on the forest floor was 29 +/- 2 and 45 +/- 3 percent, respectively Approximately 30 percent of the initial N mass was released rapidly from litter in both locations. Nitrogen loss from green shoots on the forest floor was greater; about 47 percent of the initial N mass was lost within the first three months. There was no evidence for net N immobilization by litter or green shoots, bur. the remaining N in litter was apparently recalcitrant. Annual net accumulation of C and N by epiphytic bryophytes was estimated at 37-64 g C/m(2)/yr and 0.8-1.3 g N/m(2)/yr, respectively. Previous research at this site indicated that epiphytic bryophytes retain inorganic N from atmospheric deposition to the canopy. Therefore, they play a major role in transforming N from mobile to highly recalcitrant forms in this ecosystem.

DE Cienaga Grande de Santa Marta; Caribbean coast of Colombia; mangrove
   mortality; soil hypersalinization; vegetation attributes
AB Mass mortality and biomass of mangrove trees are related to soil factors in the Caribbean Coast of Colombia. Soil properties measured were particle size distribution, bulk density, organic matter, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, pH, redox potential, salinity and extractable nitrogen (NO2, NO3, NH4) and phosphorus (PO4). Sampling was performed at three locations along two 50 m transects at each site. Soil nutrient concentrations of either exchangeable nitrogen or phosphorus were comparable to other reported values. Redox potentials (E-h) were variable probably due to microtopographic conditions and to the amount of water and organic matter present in the soil. Hydrogen potentials (pH) are within the range reported as normal for mangrove soils. Locations with highest biomass had an average soil salinity of 35 with a range of 20 to 53. Sites with dead or dwarfed vegetation had an average soil salinity of 74 and minimum and maximum values observed were 52 and 100 respectively Statistical analysis exhibited temporal and spatial differences in soil salinity and suggest that this parameter is most correlated to the development and distribution of mangrove vegetation in the area indicating that basal area and biomass volume are inversely correlated with soil salinity.

AB The growth phenology of Cyrilla racemiflora L., the dominant tree species of the montane rain forest, (subtropical lower montane rain forest, sensu Holdridge) of the Luquillo Mountains of Puerto Rico was studied intensively during 1989, and then semiannually through mid-1993 to determine the periodicity of changes in xylem structure. Four trees ac 770 m were monitored for flowering, branch elongation, leaf litterfall, and xylem cell growth and differentiation in the lower stem, and these events were related to local seasonal patterns of rainfall and temperature. Hurricane Hugo defoliated study trees in September, 1989.
   Bud-break and branch elongation in March, 1989 were followed by earlywood xylem cell production in the lower stem in April and the onset of flowering in May. Leaf litterfall was greatest between April and June, coinciding with peak branch growth and new leaf formation. Latewood xylem was produced in December. The general phenological pattern was synchronized between trees and over study years. Vessel diameter and density were monitored along with thickness of earlywood and latewood and the former converted to vessel lumen area, a measure of xylem conductance capacity. Annual growth rings were formed with periods of earlywood and latewood production coinciding with traditional summer (rainy) and winter (dry) seasons, respectively, in the Luquillo Mountains.
   Hurricane defoliation was followed by heavy flowering in 1990, a year of reduced branch elongation and annual xylem ring width, and was associated with maximum vessel lumen area, as was flowering in 1989, prior to the hurricane. Hurricane Hugo provided a perturbation that, through its elicited stress response, allowed for the demonstration of the interplay between flowering, branching, structural growth of xylem, and xylem function.

ID TREE
AB The Sulawesi red-knobbed hornbill (Aceros cassidix) is a large-bodied, frugivorous bird that nests in high densities in the Tangkoko-DuaSudara Nature Reserve, North Sulawesi, Indonesia. I measured seedling abundance and species richness, diversity, and dominance in plots placed below and immediately behind 20 active nest sites to evaluate the role of red-knobbed hornbills as agents of seed dispersal. Comparisons of treatment (below nests) and control plots (behind nests) show that hornbills affect the abundance and distribution of diet-species seedlings. Nondiet and nest tree seedlings did not differ between control and treatment plots suggesting that differences in diet species were the result of additional input by hornbills rather than by random or other dispersal events. Significantly greater numbers of diet seedlings germinated below nests, and the diversity of diet species was greater than that of nondiet. species. Dominance of a few species in the treatment plots is consistent with the hypothesis that hornbills are effectively dispersing seeds of some, but not all, of their diet species. Although seedlings under nests may eventually experience density-dependent mortality seedlings survived at least 12 months, indicating that red-knobbed hornbills were effectively dispersing seeds and influencing the initial face of seeds of several tropical forest tree species.

AB We investigated the relation between temporally varying resources, diet composition, and seed-handling behaviors in a group of blue monkeys (Cercopithecus mitis doggetti) in a tropical montane forest of Rwanda. Changes in diet composition were related to concurrent phenological studies of fruit-producing trees, and density and abundance of tree resources within the monkey's home range. Fruit composed nearly 50 percent of the diet. Over 50 percent of the fruits eaten had juicy fleshy pulp. Observations of seed handling behavior provided insights into the role of these animals as potential seed dispersal agents. The monkeys moved the seeds of 29 species out of parent canopies by defecating seeds intact and by potentially carrying seeds in cheek pouches and dropping them later. Seeds of 18 species were found intact in fecal piles. Our study showed community-level phenology patterns did not indicate a decrease in fruit availability during the study period, but an analysis of the preferred fruits consumed by the monkeys showed distinct periods of low fruit availability The study period included two dry seasons; only one of these produced a period of fruit scarcity for the animals. The animals employed different strategies during times of preferred fruit scarcity They increased consumption of leaves and other fleshy fruits, and diet diversity increased, or became mainly seed predators and diet diversity decreased. The variable responses of these monkeys to changes in food availability highlights their dietary plasticity and imposes significant variations in their role as potential seed dispersers.

AB Although little supporting data is available, mites (Acari) are often considered to be one of the 'hyperdiverse' taxa in tropical ecosystems. To test this assumption, we sampled single guilds of predatory mites (Hydracarina and Mesostigmata) in three different habitats (fresh water, rotting fungi, and forest foliage) across a range of sires in monsoonal, wet-tropical, and subtropical Australia. Most species (61%) were collected at a single site; as a result, all seven collector's curves rose steeply with little indication of reaching asymptotes. Regional faunas ranged from 87-94 percent distinct and of the 247 species identified, 114 (46%) were previously unknown in Australia and appear to be new. Even within taxonomically well-studied groups, such as the Hydracarina and Phytoseiidae, we found many new species (32% and 60%, respectively). Our results suggest that the diversity of tropical mires is very high and comparable to that of many insect taxa.
   We propose a simple model to explain our results, i.e. that in the tropics, high levels of complementarity between sires amplify local mire species richness. We rested this model by additional sampling, comparing within-site to between-site complementarity, and contrasting temperate with tropical foliar Mesostigmata. As predicted by the model, collecting at new sites continued to accumulate new species, complementarity was significantly greater between-sites than within-sires (72 vs. 25%), and temperate collections were more homogeneous and less diverse than tropical collections.

AB Tropical Nepenthes pitcher plants provide small, isolated aquatic habitats. We examined inter-pitcher variation in the community structure of the inhabitants of Nepenthes alata Blanco in West Sumatra, focusing on the conditions of the pitchers, bacterial density in the pitcher fluid, density and biomass of metazoan inhabitants, and the frequencies of interspecific encounters. Older pitchers contained more insect carcasses. The bacteria density increased with the age of the pitchers, but decreased in withered pitchers chat contained finely decomposed detritus. In live pitchers, the bacterial density, the density, mass and species richness of metazoa, and the number of trophic levels per pitcher were positively correlated with detrital mass, which was correlated with volume of pitcher fluid. The metazoan fauna from N, alata consisted of 4 predators and 12 saprophages, among the richest known for Nepenthes species. However, each individual pitcher harbored a limited numbers of species, owing to (1) the low incidence of many species, and (2) the aggregated distribution and different temporal colonization pattern of major species. Six dipteran taxa (one predator and five saprophages) accounted for the bulk of metazoan inhabitant biomass. Of 48 combinations of predator-prey encountered, only four occurred frequently (in > 30% of pitchers), which included two predators and three saprophages. Thus, individual pitchers harbored relatively simple communities despite the regional species richness, and only limited kinds of predator-prey encounters seemed to occur frequently in the regional food web. The local-scale properties of the subdivided communities presented here provide the basic information for understanding the maintenance of regional species richness and food web complexity.

AB Poison frogs in the genus Dendrobates have very small clutch sizes (2-6 eggs among species for which there are data) and typically transport their tadpoles singly to small phytotelmata, such as bromeliad tanks, leaf axils, fallen fruit capsules, and treeholes. Tadpoles of many species are predaceous, consuming larvae of insects that use the same microhabitat for breeding, such as giant. damselflies and mosquitoes. Previous studies and observations on the behavior of poison frog tadpoles led us to question whether tadpoles might be cannibalistic. We studied a population of Dendrobates castaneoticus in lowland rainforest in Para, Brazil; additional data were collected on Dendrobates auratus in Nicaragua. Ar the study site in Brazil, we established a grid of 40 Brazil nut capsules, the microhabitat used by D. castaneoticus for tadpole deposition. Of 42 tadpoles deposited during the 55 days of the study, 20 were killed or died; 16 of these were presumably killed by conspecific tadpoles. Growth rare and time to metamorphosis was higher among tadpoles that consumed three or more tadpoles or relatively large larvae of the mosquito Trichoprosopon digitatum, a colonist of newly opened Brazil nut capsules. We propose that selection has favored the development of predatory behavior in poison frog tadpoles primarily as a mechanism to eliminate predators from the small phytotelmata in which they develop and that cannibalism is a secondary outcome of this behavior. Predatory behavior also provides tadpoles with a source of food, which is frequently limited in these microhabitats. Additional studies of the biology of tadpoles of other species of Dendrobates are needed to determine the evolution of predatory and cannibalistic behavior in the clade.

AB Patterns and levels of allozyme variation among populations of Amazonian frogs were used to test the riverine barrier hypothesis of species differentiation. Two frog species were sampled from each of the two main forest habitats on both banks of the Jurua River in the southwestern Brazilian Amazon Basin at various points along its course to contrast different barrier strengths. Scarthyla ostinodactyla and Scinax rubra were sampled from flooded forest (varzea), and Physalaemus petersi and Epipedobates femoralis from non-flooded forest (terra firme). All species showed high levels of within-population genetic variation. Average Nei's (1978) and Rogers' (1972) genetic distances between sampled sites for all species were high indicating substantial among-population differentiation. The observation of low gene flow between sampled sires within species was further substantiated with Slatkin's (1993) M analyses. Randomization tests suggested that there was some population structure at a few assayed polymorphic loci that was consistent with the riverine barrier hypothesis. However, it was apparent from the raw allozyme frequency data that these results were largely driven by substantial differentiation al one or a few collecting localities rather than by basin-wide patterns of riverine differentiation. Phenograms using genetic distance matrices supported this interpretation. Patterns of geographic variation are probably more consistent with the idea of this region being a zone of secondary contact.

Information was obtained by removal trapping of mongoose from grids placed in tree plantations, colorado and tabonuco forests. Trapping efficiency was two mongoose per 100 trap-days, suggesting mongoose abundance is low in wet montane forests of Puerto Rico. Sex ratio was biased (2.6:1) in favor of males. Body masses of male mongoose inhabiting rain forests of the Luquillo Mountains were larger than those in dry forests at Guanica (P < 0.0001). Stomach contents from 18 mongoose were examined, animal matter comprised 75 percent of the total food items encountered. Of these, 33 percent were from vertebrates. The food items most frequently encountered were lizards (Anolis spp.), centipedes (Scolopendra spp.), and cockroaches (Blatellidae).

AB One hectare of tropical dry forest in Guanacaste Conservation Area, Costa Rica was mapped and all trees larger than 10 cm diameter at breast height (DBH) identified. The same hectare was sampled for leaf litter and the two data sets, forest and litter, were compared. Dominant and subdominant species of the forest are represented in the leaf litter, whereas rare tree species are highly variable in their representation in:che leaf litter. Relative abundance of dominant and subdominant tree species is represented well by the litter although absolute rank-order is not identical between source forest basal area and leaf litter mass. The litter adds a significant component to the source forest data owing to the presence of vines and lianas, and more rarely small trees or shrubs. This indicates that litter studies may be able to add depth to forest diversity surveys. The source forest also was used to test foliar physiognomic reconstructions of climate that have been proposed recently by paleobotanists as an alternative to taxonomic affinities methods. The observed climate of the area does not conform to the climatic values that were predicted by application of these new methods.

AB Processes of forest regeneration in two unlogged areas and in three areas that were logged nearly 25 years ago were quantified in Kibale National Park, Uganda. For forests to recover from logging, one would predict recruitment and growth processes to be accelerated in logged areas relative to unlogged areas, facilitating increased recruitment of trees into the adult size classes. We examined this prediction first by determining the growth of 4733 trees over a 51 to 56 month period and found that growth rates in the most heavily logged area were consistently slower than in the two unlogged areas. In contrast, the lightly logged forest had similar growth races to unlogged areas in the small size classes, but trees in the 30 to 50 cm DBH size cohort exhibited elevated growth rates relative to the unlogged areas. Mortality was highest in the heavily logged areas, with many deaths occurring when healthy trees were knocked over by neighboring treefalls. We found no difference in the density or species richness of seedlings in the logged and unlogged forests. The number of seedlings that emerged from the disturbed soil (seed bank+seed rain) and initially seed-free soil (seed rain) was greater in the logged forest than in the unlogged forest. However, sapling density was lower in the heavily logged areas, suggesting that there is a high level of seedling mortality in logged areas. We suggest that the level of canopy opening created during logging, the lack of aggressive colonizing tree species, elephant activity that is concentrated in logged areas, and an aggressive herb community, all combine to delay vegetation recovery in Kibale Forest.

AB A comparative study of vegetation structure and primary production was conducted at two mangrove sites differing essentially from each other due to their hydrological conditions. Ar each site, stand structure was characterized along a transect sec up in the main slope direction. Litter fall was monitored using 0.5 m(2) traps, and girth increment by means of fixed dendrometer bands. Stands at site A, under prevailing marine influence, were characterized by the abundance of Avicennia germinans dead trunks and multistemmed trees, by the predominance of the shrub form of Rhizophora mangle, and by a much lower dominant height and basal area than in stands at site B which were subject to terrestrial runoff. Total litterfall was measured for 389 days and reached a maximum value of 19 t/ha in site B. Fruits comprised up to a quarter parr of this production. On average, Rhizophora stands produced 1.8 to 2.5 times more leafy parts than Avicennia stands. Seasonal variations of litter production were much more pronounced in Avicennia stands than in Rhizophora stands. Girth increments averaged 10 times greater for stands at site B than for those at site A. Seasonal variations of girth increments were significantly correlated with rainfall, and it was found that during dry periods growth may be completely arrested. These results are interpreted and discussed at three levels of the spatial organization of the vegetation: sire, stand, and species.

AB Nutrient, light, salinity, soil redox potentials, and other soil characteristics were determined across a range of mangrove forest heights across the South Florida peninsula encompassing large-stature trees (> 10 m) on the west cease and dwarf forms (< 1 m) in the southeast Everglades. Relationships were established between abiotic factors and Rhizophora mangle seedling growth rates in four height (cm) classes, 25-40, > 40-55, > 55-70, and > 70-85. Light in open canopy gaps was an important determinant of seedling growth. Growth rates in gaps (0.32 +/- 0.04 to 1.89 +/- 0.18 mm/d) were two-to five-fold greater than adjacent closed canopy forests (0.14 +/- 0.01 to 0.40 +/- 0.07 mm/d). Among open canopy sites, labile soil phosphorus and soil redox potentials were significantly correlated to growth (P < 0.05; r = 0.98 and 0.89, respectively). Interstitial salinity ranged from 0 to 27 ppt across sites, well below hypersaline conditions. Thus, under low salinity stress and high light availability, soil fertility is proposed to be the dominant factor controlling R. mangle seedling development to a sapling stage (> 85 cm) in South Florida mangrove forests. In addition, soil anoxia is hypothesized to be an important stressor in lagoonal-bay estuaries and marsh-mangrove ecotones with minimal tidal exchange.

AB We investigated the distribution of primary xylovores in Rhizophora mangle (red mangrove) first-order branches, i.e., "twigs", along an architectural gradient on Belizean mangrove cays. Greater structural diversity in R. mangle architecture, xylovore availability, occurrence of natural enemies, and habitat do not result in variable xylovore species richness. Despite large differences in architectural complexity, tall, fringe, dwarf, and sapling trees host the same set of primary twig borers. However, call trees support greater diversity and abundance of twig inquilines than other tree forms. Primary twig borers have a key role in structuring these mangrove communities because their galleries and pupal chambers provide habitats for numerous species of secondary xylovores and inquilines. We also measured the amount of leaf area removed from R. mangle's canopy by wood-and leaf-feeding herbivores. Vigorously growing tall and sapling trees sustain greater losses because of twig borers than dwarf trees. However, xylovory in fringe trees was nor different from any of che other categories. Cumulative herbivory was greatest in the tall trees. In most cases, leaf-area loss as an indirect or collateral result of primary xylovory equaled or exceeded leaf-area loss as a direct result of folivory.

ID SOUTH CENTRAL-AFRICA; ECOLOGY
AB During a six year period (1990-1995) fruiting frequency among marked trees and seed production and predispersal predation by beetle larvae of Isoberlinia angolensis and Julbernardia globiflora of the Leguminosae family and Caesalpinoideae subfamily were studied at two dry miombo woodland sites in central Zambia. Fruit production varied from year to year and was not related to annual rainfall. On average I. angolensis trees fruited once every two years while J. globiflora trees fruited once every two and one-half years. Number of fruits per tree was correlated with tree size for both species. In a peak year fruit biomass represented two to four percent of total above ground biomass but for J. globiflora about 5.5 and 4.5 percent of nitrogen and potassium, respectively, were in fruits compared to 0.6 and 1.8 percent For I. angolensis. The lower fruiting frequency in J. globiflora was probably related to the depletion of N reserves during a fruiting year which required a longer replenishment period than in I. angolensis.
   Predispersal seed predation was low for J. globiflora (10%) and very high in I. angolensis (65-85%) and for the latter species predation rate increased from August to November 1991 and significant variations were observed among years and pod types. Seed predation rate was lowest in a peak fruiting year and this observation provides support for the satiation hypothesis. The results of the study also suggest that I. angolensis and J. globiflora may have different regeneration strategies although reproductive allocation in both species was within the range reported for other iteroparous plants.

AB We examined the effects of species, habitat type (open pasture, forest, and beneath isolated pasture trees), and distance from the forest/pasture edge (25 m and 250 m) on post-dispersal seed predation of ten animal-dispersed species near the Las Alturas Biological Station in southern Costa Rica. We also compared the amount of seed predation due to vertebrate and insect predators. Levels of seed predation were extremely species-specific, ranging from 20-100 percent of seeds consumed during the 30 day study period. However, the proportion of seeds remaining was not correlated with seed size. Overall, seed mortality did not differ between the forest and open pasture habitats, bur was significantly lower under isolated pasture trees. Individual species differed in which habitat they suffered the highest levels of predation. For eight of ten species studied, levels of seed predation did not vary significantly with distance from the forest/pasture edge in any habitat. The majority of the post-dispersal seed predation was due to mammalian predators. The results of this and other studies suggest char post-dispersal seed predation may influence patterns of forest regeneration in disturbed areas.

AB Mutualistic relations between the bar Glossophaga longirostris and columnar cacti were studied in the Andean arid region of La Tatacoa, Huila, Colombia. By means of monthly censuses between August 1993 and July 1994, the diet and reproductive pattern of this bat species was determined. This bat consumed pollen (53%) of cacti and of Helicteris baruensis (Sterculiaceae) and fruits (41%) of the columnar cactus Stenocereus griseus and, in lower quantities, of Muntingia calabura (Elaeocarpaceae) and Pilosocereus sp. (Cactaceae). Pollen appeared in feces and/or pelage of G. longirostris throughout the year, being more frequent during the dry season. Seeds appeared in the feces during the rainy season. The seasonal variations in diet were correlated with the availability of resources in the area and do not appear to reflect a dietary preference on the part of G. longirostris. This bat had two reproductive periods. The presence of lactating females coincided with the two rainy seasons and the months of highest fruit production of S. griseus. These results are not consistent with those reported for the Andean acid region of Lagunillas, Merida, Venezuela. In that region, G. longirostris depends for its diet and reproduction on three columnar cactus species (S. griseus, Subpilocereus repandus and Pilosocereus tillianus). The differences found in the diet and periods of reproductive of these two populations of G. longirostris, may reflect differences in the temporal and spatial distribution of food resources. The mutualistic relation between G. longirostris and columnar cacti, specially with S. griseus appear to be tightly interdependent.

AB Seasonal variation and spatial distribution in ground foraging rain forest ants were studied in South Kannada-Kodagu District in Karnataka (India) between 1990 and 1991 by pie-fall trap sampling. All ant species showed marked seasonality. A total of 31 species were recorded from the primary forest over a period of two years. More species were recorded from the closed canopy forest than from tree fall gaps in primary forest. All ant species showed marked seasonality with fewer species and individuals sampled/plot during the wetter seasons. The numerically dominant species, Pheidole sp,. was markedly lower in abundance during the wet seasons. Spatial patterns were also studied during a dry season both in the primary forest and an adjacent logged forest. More species were recorded from the logged forest than the primary forest. Community composition in primary forest was different from that in logged forest. Common species were more ubiquitous than rarer species. Species were distributed bimodally across sampling plots. Probable underlying processes behind these seasonal and spatial patterns have been discussed.

ID COMMUNITIES; DYNAMICS
AB Much of the remaining "forest" vegetation in eastern Chiapas, Mexico is managed for coffee on. In this region coffee is grown under either the canopy of nat ural forest or under a planted canopy dominated by Inga spp. Despite the large differences in diversity of dominant plant species, both planted and rustic shade coffee plantations support a high overall diversity of bird species; we recorded approximately 105 species in each plantation type on fixed radius point counts. We accumulated a combined species list of 180 species on repeatedly surveyed transects through both coffee plantation types. These values are exceeded regionally only by moist tropical forest. Of the habitats surveyed, shade coffee was second only to acacia groves in the abundance and diversity of Nearctic migrants. The two plantation types have similar bird species lists and both are similar in composition to the dominant woodland-mixed pine-oak. Both types of shade coffee plantation habitats differ from other local habitats in supporting highly seasonal bird populations. Survey numbers almost double during the dry season-an increase that is found in omnivorous migrants and omnivorous, frugivorous, and nectarivorous resident species. Particularly large influxes were found for Tennessee warblers (Vermivora peregrina) and northern orioles (Icterus galbula) in Inga dominated plantations.

AB The pattern of canopy distribution and some water relations characteristics of the epiphytic cacti Epiphyllum phyllanthus and Rhipsalis baccifera and the epiphytic ferns Polypodium crassifolium and Polypodium phyllitidis were examined in the tropical forest of Barro Colorado Island, Panama. The epiphytic cacti were 6-fold more succulent than the epiphytic ferns, which had a 9-fold higher root:shoot ratio. The four species, especially the cacti, were more abundant on the deciduous trees Ceiba pentandra, Platypodium elegans, and Tabebuia guayacan than on the evergreen Anacardium excelsum. The water-holding capacity of the bark was 2-fold higher for A. excelsum and T. guayacan than for C. pentandra and P. elegans; the main crotches of the latter species intercepted 2-fold more rainfall than chose of the former. Well-watered planes of all epiphytic species showed similar total daily transpiration. After 2 weeks of drought, daily transpiration decreased an average of 48 percent for the cacti and 73 percent for the ferns. After 4 weeks of drought, daily transpiration decreased 80 percent for the cacti and was eliminated for the ferns; succulence then decreased an average of 29 percent for the cacti and 98 percent for the ferns, but all species recovered fully within 2 d after rewetting. The epiphytic ferns had a low relative capacitance (0.16 M/Pa), causing these presumably C-3 plants often to be under water stress. A high relative capacitance (0.50 M/Pa) and crassulacean acid metabolism allowed the epiphytic cacti to occur most frequently on the driest sites of this tropical forest.

AB Seed weight, days to germination and seed viability were observed for 99 species growing in the Western Ghats of Karnataka, India. Seed size was strongly correlated with days to germination; smaller seeds germinated faster than larger seeds. Species which flowered during the rainy season had lighter seeds than species which flowered during the dry season. It was also found that seed size and viability of seeds were related to the season of fruiting. Species which fruit during the rainy season had heavier seeds and shorter viability than species which fruit during the dry season. These flowering and fruiting patterns and varying seed sizes are argued to be adaptations to the rime of dispersal, time of moisture availability in the habitat and seedling survival.

AB We define 48 allozyme loci for a tropical pioneer tree species, Cecropia obtusifolia Bertol, which has high contents of secondary compounds. Our goals were to find the effects of extraction procedures on artifacts and variation in resolution of enzyme banding patterns; to explore the relationship among the variation of the loci sampled and the enzymes' molecular structure, metabolic function and substrate; to obtain estimates of the genetic variation in this species at Los Tuxtlas rain forest (Mexico) and to explore the variation of allelic frequencies in six successive life-history stages of the species.
   The resolution of the isozymes bands and the actual banding pattern varied with the type and age of tissue, the collection and storage procedures, the extraction buffer, and other loading and running procedural derails. However, artifactual variation was eliminated with a new extraction buffer for species with high contents of secondary compounds.
   Of the 26 enzymes resolved for C. obtusifolia, we found that enzymes with a greater number of substrates and an oligomeric quaternary structure tended to be more variable than their counterparts, but the relationship was not statistically significant. The proportion of polymorphic systems varied significantly with the metabolic pathway and the function of the enzymes. Enzymes involved in starch synthesis are significantly more variable (p < 0.05) than all others, except those involved in amino acids metabolism and the proportion of polymorphic enzymes is also significantly associated with the function of the enzyme, the hydrolases and isomerases are significantly more variable than lyases and oxidoreductases enzymes.
   The percentage of polymorphic loci for C. obtusifolia was estimated at P = 27.1%. The effective number of alleles was estimated at ne = 1.3 and ne = 2.4 for all loci and only polymorphic ones respectively and the average heterozygosity (H) for all 48 loci was estimated at H = 0.05. Allele frequencies varied throughout the life-cycle of the species, with significant differences for some alleles and loci among some life-cycle stages. ''Tree seeds'' allele frequencies differ significantly (P < 0.05) from ''rainy dispersed seeds'' in 7 of 8 loci and from ''soil seeds'' in six of eight loci. Allele frequencies of all three seed categories (''tree seeds'', ''rainy dispersed seeds'', and ''soil seeds'') differed strongly from established individuals (seedlings, juveniles and adults), while allele frequencies of established individuals are relatively similar to one another. Seedling allele frequencies at most loci were also significantly different from those found in seeds collected from trees, seed-rain, and soil. Two alleles (at GOT-2 and FE-2) were only found in soil seeds and one allele (at LAP-2) was only found in seedlings.

AB We studied flowering phenology at the level of individual branches within strangler fig trees to determine (1) whether branches bloomed asynchronously within trees and (2) whether asynchrony, if observed, could be ascribed to genetically different branches of mosaic trees (i.e., trees formed by spontaneous grafting of generically different individuals) undergoing individual flowering cycles that were out of phase with each ocher. Although asynchrony was fairly common, it most of reflected individual branches failing to bloom during one flowering episode, chen coming back to bloom in synchrony at the next episode. We detected fewer mosaic trees than expected, and found only a very weak suggestion that mosaic trees may show less within-tree synchrony than simple trees.

AB Palicourea padifolia is a distylous shrub visited primarily by hummingbirds and bees in mid-elevation rain forests in Costa Rica. At Las Cruces Biological Station, the population of P. padifolia is composed of equal numbers of pin and thrum plants and morphs are randomly distributed. Like the majority of distylous species, P. padifolia exhibits a self- and intramorph-incompatible mating system. The analysis of stigmatic pollen loads obtained From emasculated flowers shows that pollen flow between floral morphs is disassortative, which supports the Darwinian hypothesis concerning the adaptive significance of heterostyly. Pins experience greater disassortative pollination than thrums. Pins also sec more seed than thrums, suggesting that the higher frequency of compatible pollen deposited on pin stigmas results in greater fecundity; alternatively, greater seed set in pins could be due to the differential allocation of resources to male and female function between morphs. Overall, seed sec for the Las Cruces population of P. padifolia is much lower than the potential maximum. Factors which could contribute to seed sec limitation include the frequency and/or spatial pattern of pollinator visits, pollen availability, and resource availability.

AB Prestoea schultzeana is a monoecious, protandrous palm in the forest understory of Amazonian Ecuador. We studied its leaf production, population density, sexual expression, phenology, pollination, and the specificity of the Bora visitors. On average, 1.4 leaves and 0.9 inflorescences are produced per individual per year. The number of staminate flowers per inflorescence is relatively constant compared with the number of pistillate flowers which varies greatly. Flowering occurs in staminate and pistillate phases of approximately 19 and 0-7 days duration, respectively. Flowers open in the morning, and staminate flowers abscise in the afternoon of the same day whereas pistillate flowers last for two days. Flowers are whitish-yellow with a sweet odor and produce nectar. They were visited by Coleoptera (Chrysomelidae, Curculionidae, Nitidulidae, Ptiliidae, Staphylinidae), Hemiptera, Diptera (Drosophilidae, Syrphidae, Ceratopogonidae), Lepidoptera (Nymphalidae), and Hymenoptera (Formicidae, Halictidae). All examined individuals of the syrphid fly Copestylum sp. visiting pistillate flowers carried 100-500 grains of P. schultzeana pollen. Pollen occurred on all body parts, but especially on the legs, and this makes Copestylum sp. the most important pollinator. Most floral visitors were also frequent on the Bowers of co-occurring plant species; notably the palm Hyospathe elegan, shared most visitor species with P. schultzeana.

AB Mangroves in disparate families produce viviparous seedlings (propagules) that are attacked by many crab and insect predators both before and after dispersal. While post-dispersal predation is viewed as an important factor in structuring many mangrove communities, pre-dispersal predation rates and agents have been characterized for few species. Ten species of mangrove and 3299 propagules were surveyed for pre-dispersal propagule predation at 42 sites around the world. Pre-dispersal predation rates were variable among sites and species, ranging from 0 to 93 percent within stands, with a global total predation rate of 23.3 percent (across all propagules examined) and a mean level of 28.3 percent across sites. Grapsid crabs, Coleoptera and Lepidoptera were the primary predators identified. Forests near human population centers and stands occurring at high intertidal sites exhibited higher levels of propagule predation than those in unpopulated or low-intertidal sires. Predation rates on a species were weakly, negatively correlated with conspecific seedling density at a sire. To explore temporal variation in, and ramifications of pre-dispersal predation for propagule growth and abscission dynamics, Rhizophora mangle propagules were monitored over two years at three sires in Belize, Central America. Predation did not significantly reduce hypocotylar growth of germinated propagules on the parent tree, but nearly doubled the abscission race of premature propagules. Pre-dispersal propagule predation is a ubiquitous feature of mangrove forests world-wide, and must be accounted for in estimates of reproductive output, stand health, and propagule availability for forestry and restoration efforts.

AB In the extant lemur communities of Madagascar the number of lemur species increases with increasing number of tree species. In forests with few tree species lemurs use patches with higher number of tree species than average. However, in forest plots with high number of tree species, lemurs stay in places with lower number of tree species than average. At low tree species diversity a minimum number of different tree species seems to be required within the animals' home range to assure year-round food availability. At high tree species diversity tree species essential for survival might be ''diluted'' by resources which are of no use for lemurs, thus increasing energetic expenses for traveling between suitable patches. According to the present analyses, structural diversity is of subordinate importance to the number of tree species as a correlate of lemur species richness.
   Within limits of disturbance intensity and on a small geographic scale, disturbances increase forest productivity. Lemurs reach higher species numbers and population densities in slightly disturbed areas compared with undisturbed sites. This peaked curve of the number of lemur species over disturbance, however, may not only be a consequence of ''resource dilution'' in undisturbed sites and higher food abundance in slightly disturbed areas, but also a consequence of selective extinction of lemur species which were unable to cope with the disturbance regime exaggerated by human interference over the last few hundred or thousand years.

AB The selection of optimal basking perches to achieve preferred body temperatures and avoid predation risks is one of the most important behavioral decisions that a lizard makes. We studied perch selection by the spiny-tailed Iguana (Ctenosaura hemilopha) in Baja California Sur where they bask on elevated cacti. The more important factor determining cardon selection by iguanas was the presence of old woodpecker holes which could be used as refuges within the top 50 cm of a branch. Other factors are the height of the cardon, the presence of some other holes and the number of branches of the plant. These data suggest that predation risk is the strongest factor affecting the selection of certain cardons as basking structures by spiny-railed iguanas. Because the holes are mainly old woodpecker nests, the choice of a cardon as a refuge-perching sire has to be related to a prior selection by woodpeckers.

AB Ant communities were surveyed along an elevational gradient in the Philippines extending from lowland dipterocarp forest (250 m elevation) to messy forest (1750 m). Standardized pitfall trapping in arboreal and terrestrial microhabitats at seven sites yielded 51 species. Collecting by hand at five of the sites yielded 48 species. The two methods produced substantially different assemblages, with only 22 species (29%) taken in common. Only a fraction of the total ant community appeared to be sampled at most of the sites. Measures of species richness and relative abundance peaked at mid-elevations and declined sharply with increasing elevation. Ants were extremely rare above 1500 m elevation. Arboreal ants were trapped much less frequently than terrestrial ants at all sites. Ant species that were abundant had broader elevational distributions than those chat were less common, but most species were rare and occurred at only one or two sites. The elevational patterns for ants are largely the inverse of those documented for Philippine small mammals which reach their greatest diversity and abundance at high elevations where ants are rare. This suggests that the two groups may interact competitively. Some of the patterns observed or inferred from this study may apply to tropical ant communities in general, and are presented as series of testable hypotheses as a guide and stimulus for future research.

AB We determined races of decomposition and asymbiotic nitrogen fixation in the leaf litter of Cheirodendron spp. on the Hawaiian Islands. Leaf litter was collected from four sites on a long soil-age gradient (300 yr to 4.1 M yr) and decomposed at two sires that differed widely in substrate age and nutrient availability. Rates of decomposition were higher in litter decomposed at the older site, where nutrient availability was greater. A substantial amount of nitrogen and phosphorus immobilization occurred in litter decomposed at the older sire, with more immobilization occurring in litter with lower initial nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations, suggesting both supply and demand controls on nutrient immobilization. Potential rates of nitrogen fixation were very low in the first 25 d (0-5 nmol acetylene/gdw/h), rose to much higher rates by 70 d (20-45 nmol), and then declined by 140 d. We found no significant difference in rates of potential nitrogen fixation between sites of decomposition, but there was a strong substrate effect, with higher rates in litter with low lignin, low nitrogen, and high phosphorus. Where significant immobilization of nitrogen occurred for decomposing Cheirodendron, nitrogen fixation could have comprised no more than 10 percent of immobilized nitrogen. Overall, rates of nitrogen fixation were dependent on the source of the decomposing substrate but not on the site of decomposition, while short-term decomposition and nutrient immobilization were strongly dependent on the site of decomposition hut not as much on the source of the decomposing substrate.

AB Hawaiian forests are subject to the effects of periodic hurricane conditions. Hurricane Iniki struck the island of Kauai, Hawaii on September 11, 1992 with winds exceeding 200 km/h and caused defoliation, felling of trees by snapping and uprooting, and standing tree mortality due excessive limb and leaf loss. The purpose of this study was to evaluate if measured wood mechanical characteristics could be correlated with stem failure of trees under windstorm conditions. A field survey indicated that pose-hurricane stem condition (snapped, uprooted, or standing) differed among five common canopy species and was significantly correlated with stem apparent elastic modulus (relative flexibility). Species that tended to snap had significantly higher apparent elastic moduli than those that remained standing or were uprooted. Wood density and stem diameter were not significantly related to stem failure mode. Native trees had a higher percentage per species of standing individuals bur also had increased uprooting. Nonnative tree species were more often snapped and fewer were standing after the hurricane. The higher incidence of stem failure for introduced canopy trees may increase the spread of alien understory species following wind disturbance events. These relationships provide a simple means to predict relative differences in stem failure due to high wind conditions and should be considered in planning reforestation efforts on the Hawaiian Islands.

AB Hurricane Joan struck the Caribbean Coast of Nicaragua in October 1988 causing extensive damage ro the lowland rain forest of the zone. Six permanent plots were established in 1990 and the growth rates of all individuals in a total area of 6000 m(2) monitored for six years. Eighteen of the species were abundant enough to measure species-specific growth rates. The post hurricane successional process included a great deal of resprouting of pre-existing individuals and the current stare of the forest includes a low bur very dense canopy, suggesting that competition is entering an intensive phase. Specific growth rates between the rime of the hurricane and the present thus represent establishment or regenerative growth rates and provide an indication of whether or not distinct regeneration niches exist. Three distinct patterns of growth rare seem apparent, fast-growing heliophyles (eight species), slow-growing resprouters (nine species), and Vochysia ferruginea, which seems to have a special pattern.

AB Myrrhinium atropurpureum has unusual floral characteristics: sweet, juicy petals, long vivid stamens, and absence of nectar and odor. This uncommon syndrome is morphologically and anatomically described. Floral phenology is also described, and censuses of flower visitors are provided. The main pollinators are frugivorous passerine birds;which are attracted by the petals. This type of flora reward is very uncommon and seems to be restricted, in South America, to Myrrhinium Feijoa (Myrtaceae) and Calceolaria (Scrophulariaceae). The possible origin of the pollination mechanism is discussed.

AB The goal of this study was to determine whether there exists intersexual differences in the degree of herbivore attack on a tropical, dioecious tree. Neea psychotrioides is a Costa Rican tree that experiences at least two types of attack on its reproductive structures: flower herbivory and gall formation on inflorescences. Although female trees were more common than males in the two study populations (overall sex ratio = 1.5 females/male), male flowers were more likely to be eaten by lepidopteran larvae. Similarly, inflorescence-borne, fly-induced galls were more frequent on males. Ten families of insects from three orders (Diptera, Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera) occupied the gals with varying levels of parasitism and hyperparasitism occurring within. Although the sexes were not significantly different in vegetative size, males had larger flora displays (more inflorescences and larger flowers) that may have acted as attractants to herbivores and gall makers. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that flower damage and the energetic costs of producing gals exert a greater expense to males, ultimately resulting in death, and over rime, a skewing of the sex ratio.

AB We examined the potential for exploitation competition by differential attractiveness in two sympatric species of columnar cacti on Curacao, Netherlands Antilles. Stenocereus griseus and Subpilocereus repandus have temporally over-lapping flowering phenologies and share pollinators. We examined nectar volume, energy contents, and sugar ratios for the entire night and at two-hour intervals in both cactus species. Except for a burst in nectar volume and sugar concentration by Subpilocereus repandus during the first two hours of anthesis, nectar secretion patterns, energy contents, and sugar ratios (70% hexose) were similar for the two species. The standing crops of nectar in both species were kept very low by bar pollinators. We suggest that the potential for exploitation competition between Stenocereus griseus and Subpilocereus repandus is currently very low on Curacao.

AB One hundred and thirty-eight seat (faecal) samples From 17 mammal species native to forests of northeastern Queensland were examined for the presence of spores of both ectomycorrhizal and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Spores of mycorrhizal fungi were found in 57 percent of scar samples representing 12 animal species (Aepyprymnus rufescens, Antechinus godmani, Bettongia tropica, Hypsiprymnodon moschatus, Isoodon macrourus, Melomys crevinipes, Perameles nasuta, Rattus fuscipes, R. tunneyi, Thylogale stigmatica, Trichosurus vulpecula, Uromys caudimaculatus). Spores were absent in seats of Antechinus stuartii, Dasyurus hallucatus, Dendrolagus lumholtzi, Petaurus australis and Mesembriomys gouldii. Spores of ectomycorrhizal fungi occurred in 38 percent of seats, and all hut one of these samples were from Eucalyptus-dominated sclerophyll forests. Based on the frequency and abundance of spores in seats, five mammals were active considered active consumers of hypogeous mycorrhizal sporocarps in sclerophyll Forests (A. rufescens, B. tropica, I. macrourus, P. nasuta, and U. caudimaculattus). Individual seats of these animals generally contained a range of distinctive spore types. Spores of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi were Found in low abundance in almost 40 percent of seat samples collected, from both sclerophyll forest and rainforest habitats. We suggest that the majority of these spores were acquired incidentally through ingestion of soil during foraging activities on the forest floor. Glasshouse inoculation experiments in which seedlings of Eucalyptus grandis and Sorghum bicolor were inoculated with scat material from several species of mammal demonstrated that the spores of ectomycorrhizal and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi retained some viability and colonized the roots of host-plant seedlings. Insufficient information is known of the ecology of mycorrhizal fungi in Australia's tropical forests to speculate as to the implications of these findings for forest conservation and rehabilitation.

AB Whereas ant mosaics have been widely recognized and described in tropical ecosystems, data on space partitioning among arboreal termite colonies are rudimentary. During a long term field study in New Guinea, the distribution of arboreal termite species in coconut plantations as well as the extent and dynamics of competition between them were investigated. The three dominant species, Microcerotermes biroi, Nasutitermes princeps and N. novarumhebridarum, feed on the same items but never exploit the same tree. The resulting distribution pattern is a mosaic with two peculiarities. First, some extended areas around N. princeps colonies appear unexploited, as this species practices interference competition on a wide scale, defending large territories inter- and intra-specifically. Second, interspecific relations are asymmetrical. In some plantations, large colonies of N. princeps expand their territory by destroying colonies of M. biroi, but when the pressure of N. princeps is relaxed, dense populations of colonies of M. biroi can recolonize the trees in a few years' rime. Territorial boundaries may thus change relatively fast. N. novarumhebridarum often colonizes dead trees and interferes less with the other species. These facts are consistent with each species' reproductive investment strategy Hypotheses are proposed to explain how the dominant species can coexist, even in long established plantations.

AB Food habits of jaguar and puma were studied in two regions of the Paraguayan Chaco. Biochemical analysis of 280 seats attributed 106 to jaguar and 35 to puma. Overall dietary overlap was 65 percent and they shared six of seven main prey types. For both cats 43 percent of prey items and 15 percent of prey biomass taken were mammal species <1 kg, 23 percent of items and 29 percent of the biomass were from species 1-15 kg, and 27 percent of items and 53 percent of the biomass were from larger species. Birds, reptiles, and insects made up the remainder. In a developed region no significant differences between their diets were found, while in an undeveloped area more small mammals were taken by both species, and jaguar took more large prey than puma. The potential roles of competition and of differences in habitat structure and prey availability between the two areas on these species' diets are discussed.

AB Two bat species, Leptonycteris curasoae and Glossophaga longirostris, are the principal pollinators of at least two of the three species of columnar cacti that grow on the semiarid island of Curacao, Netherlands, Antilles. I examined the importance of the cacti in the diets of the bars and found that 85-91 percent of their diet samples contained cactus pollen and seeds. Ar least 43 percent of the samples from each species contained cactus pollen and/or seeds exclusively. Leptonycteris curasoae consumes nectar and pollen of Ceiba pentandra and Agave spp. at the beginning of the dry season and G. longirostris also consumes a few other plant products in the wet season, bur both bat species depend nutritionally on cacti. Female bars give birth to one pup per year, and the periods of parturition and lactation in each species correspond to peaks in the reproductive phenology of the two most abundant columnar cactus species. From personal observations and a review of the literature, I determined that bars were unlikely to By to the mainland to feed, although L. curasoae may do so. I conclude that the interdependence of bats and cacti is suggestive of coevolution, and that columnar cacti are critical far the survival and persistence of nectar-feeding bats on Curacao.

AB Tropical cyclones pass over or near American Samoa on average about once every 3 years. Because many trees may be stripped of leaves, flowers, and fruit, cyclones exert a major impact on the feeding ecology of nectivorous and frugivorous living foxes. We examined starch time and in-tree time immediately postcyclone (3-6 weeks) and during a recovery period (15-16 months after the last cyclone). Both Pteropus tonganus and P. samoensis increased search time and decreased tree rime (an indication of less food available per tree) immediately after the passage of cyclone Ofa.

ID COMMUNITIES
AB Mangrove forests of Bahla Las Minas on the Caribbean coast of Panama were affected by large oil spills twice over the last 30 yr. Lethal and sublethal damage to these mangroves by the two spills was evaluated from aerial photographs, and in the field. The first spill occurred in 1968 when the tanker Witwater broke up and sunk, releasing 2.8-3.8 million liters of diesel oil and Bunker C fuel oil, and killing 49 ha of mangroves or 4 percent of the mangroves in the bay. The second was in 1986 when a Land tank at the Refineria Panama ruptured, releasing at least 8 million liters of crude oil, and killing 69 ha of mangroves or 6 percent of those in the bay. In each case, the areas affected most were the low to mid intertidal zone dominated by Rhizophora mangle. The extent and location of deforestation was site- and spill-specific, notably influenced by prevailing wind and tidal conditions. Some areas were deforested twice. Possible sublethal damage to surviving forests was assessed for the 1986 spill, noting that areas of unusually ''open'' canopy exceeded 307 ha. Field studies, reported elsewhere, confirmed that canopy leaf biomass decreased in ''open'' canopy sites where oil concentrations in surrounding sediments increased. Therefore, in 1986, a further 34 percent of mangrove forests in the bay probably suffered damage hem oiling, and the sum of these partially damaged forests plus the deforested areas more closely represents the total area of damage. It appears that only 18 percent of trees oiled in this bay eventually died, and the total area of damaged mangroves after the large 1986 oil spill was 5-6 times greater than the deforested areas alone.

AB We characterized plant regeneration in four old logging roads (700-1000 m long), 12-17 yr after abandonment, in selectively logged forests in lowland Costa Rica. Sets of 4-m(2) plots were laid out at 20-m intervals in three distinct microhabitats: road crack (topsoil eliminated), road edge (where removed topsoil accumulates on the sides after road construction), and adjacent logged forest. Density of stems greater than or equal to 1 m tall and less than or equal to 5 cm DBH (included canopy tree, midstory tree, liana, palm, shrub, and tree fern species) was highest in the road edge plots than either the track or logged forest plots. This ''edge effect'' is presumably due to buried seed germination of light-demanding trees and shrubs after moderate soil disturbance, less compaction, and higher substrate fertility than in road tracks. Species richness was the lowest, but relative dominance the highest, in the crack plots of all roads: 6-9 species comprised alone 50 percent of the Importance Value Index (IVI), in contrast to 11-15 and 16-22 species required to reach 50 percent IVI in edge and forest plots, respectively. We found evidence of soil compaction in tracks of three out of four roads which, in addition to low substrate fertility, and initial lack of on-sire plant propagules, could explain slower recovery of stem density and species richness compared to edge and logged forest plots. For stems >5 cm and less than or equal to 20 cm DBH, density and basal area in the track plots averaged about one-fourth of edge and logged forest plot values. We estimated recovery of basal area in road tracks to take at least 80 yr to reach the status Found in logged forest, and species richness over an even longer period. We suggest that abandoned logging roads serve as long corridors of relatively uniform and long-lasting floristic and structural characteristics that may confer particular ecological roles in selectively logged forests.

AB Many studies demonstrating the high species diversity of old growth tropical rain forest plant communities have focused on tree species while neglecting the composition of understory shrubs. This study addresses whether the floristic composition, species diversity, richness, and density of three common families of understory shrubs (Melastomataceae, Piperaceae, and Rubiaceae) are different between two secondary growth forests of different ages (12 and 25-years old) and an adjacent old growth forest at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. Twenty-two species encountered (47%) occurred only in secondary growth, one species occurred only in old growth forest and 24 species (51%) occurred in both types of forest. Both of the secondary forest understories had higher Shannon-Wiener diversity values, and had higher species richness and density than the old growth forest. Diversity, species richness, and density were not statistically different between several distances from the boundary separating secondary and old growth forests. Understory plant species assemblages may have different patterns of diversity than tree species because of variable responses to different abiotic Factors. Furthermore, the canopies of secondary growth forests may be more open than in old growth Forests, allowing higher levels of light at the shrub layer which may result in shrub assemblages of higher diversity than adjacent old growth forest.

AB Dispersion of individuals and patches of individuals are presented for nine species of epiphytic and lithophytic orchids in the genus Lepanthes. Parches is defined as the group of individuals present on a phorophyte. Mean number and standard error of reproductive individuals per patch range from 11.6 +/- 5.1 in Lepanthes eltoroensis, to 45.5 +/- 5.2 in L. rupestris. Most parches contain few reproductive individuals and usually a few patches had most of the adults. The distribution of patch sizes is skewed and most patches carry fewer individuals than the mean. Therefore means may not be an appropriate measure of central tendency as shown by mean crowding and mean patchiness indices. Mean distances between patches range from 4.8 m in L. rupestris to 95.5 m in L, dodiana. Most species have a mean nearest neighbor patch further than 50 m. A regular pattern of dispersion is often observed at distances of 5 and 10 m while at larger distances patches are more frequently aggregated. Large distances between patches and few individuals per patch suggest that small effective population sizes may be common in these orchids if gene how is restricted.

AB The abundance and distribution of vines were studied in a desert plant community at the Centro Ecologico de Sonora in Mexico. A total of 14 vine species representing eight families were recorded in the sampled area (0.6 ha). Mean vine abundance was 2859 individuals/ha. Overall, Cardiospermum corindum was the most frequent vine species whereas Janusia californica, C. corindum and J. linearis were the most abundant. Vine species richness was highest in streams and poorest in plains; species diversity in streams was more than twice the value found for plains. Several species were more abundant in streams than in plains or hillslopes. Merremia palmeri and Nissolia schottii were almost exclusively found along streams and were virtually absent From plains and hillslopes.
   The most important host species were Olneya tesota, Mimosa laxiflora and Cercidium microphyllum as they supported 60 percent of the vines found in the sampled area. O. tesota was the most important host in plains, M. laxiflora along screams and C. microphyllum on hillslopes. Only two climbing mechanisms were found among vines: twining and tendrils. Mean leaf size among sampled vine species was 13 cm(2) and the average specific leaf mass was 50 g/m(2). The results are compared with surveys of vines from tropical and temperate forest communities. We suggest that trellis and water availability could be major factors controlling the abundance and distribution of vines in desert plant communities.

AB The phenology of 19 species of plants was followed for two years at Serra Talhada, Pernambuco Stare, Northeastern Brazil. Ten plants of each species were monitored biweekly. All plants had a complete canopy cover from February (well established rainy season) until May-June (just after rains ceased), and all but a few individuals, belonging to six species, were leafless in October-November (peak of the dry season). Leaf fall and flush, flowering, and fruiting were almost continuous in the community throughout both the years, but they peaked at different periods. The peak of leaf flush preceded the rainy season, spurred by occasional rains, followed by flowering early in the rainy season, and then fruiting. Leaf fall became more pronounced after the rainy season. The species covered a whole range of deciduousness, from those which retained their leaves throughout both years to those which were leafless during 6-7 months each year. This was mostly due to the capacity of leaf retention after the onset of the dry season. Autochoric and zoochoric species produced fruits mostly during the rainy season and anemochoric species during the dry period. The patterns of flowering and fruiting were complex. One species did not produce flowers or fruits in either year; five produced flowers and fruits in one year only and two others produced flowers in both years but fruits in only one. Most of the other species had high intraspecific synchrony and produced flowers for a shorter period than fruits.

Our work in the Ivory Coast shows that both are active pollinators, and that they may be found together in the same syconia. In our study area, C. silvestrianus is much more abundant than C. flabellatus. We found no competitive effect for oviposition sites on C. silvestrianus, and hypothesize that habitat preferences allow the coexistence of two sympatric active pollinators in the same Ficus host in the Ivory Coast.

AB Byrsonima crassifolia (L.), a Neotropical malpighiaceous tree or treelet, has flowers that produce abundant lipids instead of nectar. Several species of Centris bees collect this oil. The floral oil shows variation between trees and can be separated into two types. One type is most common (11 of 14 samples) and consists of mono- and di-glycerides, some free fatty acids, a small amount of cri-glycerides and a trace of carbohydrate. The composition of the glycerides is predominantly (53-63%) esters of unsaturated 18C-22C fatty acids with the rest made up of 14C-18C saturated fatty acids. The second type of floral oil is similar to type one except that the samples contain large amounts of an unknown lipid more polar than the standards.

AB The foraging activity of the leaf-cutting ant Ana laevigata in an early successional area near Manaus, Brazil, was monitored over a period of 18 mo. Four Cecropia species were growing in that area and all were associated with the ant Azteca alfari. Unoccupied trees (those in which there was no ant response to mechanical disturbance of the stem) were attacked by leaf-cutting ants more often than were trees occupied by A. alfari colonies.
   Cecropia ulei was the most frequently attacked species. However, leaves of C. ulei were the least preferred ones during assays in which detached leaves of the four Cecropia species were placed alongside the foraging trails of leafcutting ant colonies. C. ulei had the largest number of unoccupied trees compared to the other species. In addition, A. alfari colonies associated with C. ulei were smaller than chose associated with C. distachya. These data suggest that A. alfari was influencing the selection of Cecropia species by A. laevigata, which harvested more from species that were less defended by the ants (with a higher proportion of unoccupied trees or trees hosting smaller ant colonies), although these were less preferred.

AB Pitfall traps were used to monitor the activity of ants in a forest floor and a one-year-old fallow plot in Ile-Ife, Nigeria, at monthly intervals between November 1980 and October 1981. Similar studies were carried out between October 1987 and June 1988. These studies also included manual collection of ants from the floor of the experimental plots. Of all the 10 species of ants recorded, Pheidole crassinoda was the most abundant in the forest and fallow plots both in 1980-81 and 1987-88. P. crassinoda accounted for 52 percent and 88 percent of the ant populations collected manually from the forest and fallow plots respectively between December 1987 and June 1988. This species was also significantly higher in the pitfall catches of the fallow than the forest plots. Pitfall traps were not effective in sampling the populations of the belligerent Dorylus nigricans. The data are consistent with the widely accepted notion that forested areas support less ants than unforested areas. Differences in physical habitat characteristics, food availability, nesting habits, predation and microenvironmental factors were considered responsible for the differences in activities and abundance of ants in the forest and fallow plots.

ID SOUTHWESTERN AMAZONIA; BEHAVIOR; COMMUNITY; FOREST
AB Spec-mapping of territories was used to document the restriction of nineteen bird species to thickets of bamboo (Guadua weberbaueri) in lowland forests in southeastern Peru. These species were defined as bamboo specialists. An additional seven species showed a preference for such thickets, but also used other habitats. These results correspond with previous, qualitative descriptions of the habitat preferences of bamboo specialists. At least four specialists are restricted to thickets throughout their entire geographic range (obligate bamboo specialists); another nine specialists may use other habitats sparingly away from southeastern Peru (near-obligate bamboo specialists); the remaining six species are frequent users of habitats lacking bamboo away from southeastern Peru (facultative bamboo specialists). The nonbamboo habitats used by the 13 near-obligate and facultative specialists are predominantly dense habitats with low canopy cover, including treefall gaps and early successional vegetation along rivers. The obligate and near-obligate specialists generally have small geographic ranges centered in southwestern Amazonia; a few have sister taxa in southeastern Brazil that are also bamboo specialists suggesting a common evolutionary history. The facultative specialists are generally mote widespread. Bamboo specialists are more abundant in bamboo habitats than are other bird species in more generalized habitats.

AB We studied water loss in eight insular populations of the lizard Anolis cristatellus wileyae and in one population of A. ernestwilliamsi in the British Virgin Islands. We found a strong negative correlation between habitat aridity and coral and cutaneous water loss rare (ranging from 1.5-10.3 mg g(-1) h(-1)) and a strong positive correlation between habitat aridity and integument resistance to water loss (28.5-199.0 s cm(-1)). Water loss and integumentary resistance of A. ernestwilliamsi were similar to what would be predicted for A. cristatellus living in the same habitat. The Guana Island population of A. cristatellus was significantly different from all other populations. We believe two processes are responsible; phenotypic plasticity explains most of the observed variability, but genetic differentiation may be responsible for the distinction of lizards from Guana.

AB We examined three disturbed, but distinctly different, sires on the historically forested eastern slope of the Sierra de Baoruco, Provincia de Barahona, Republica Dominicana, in order to evaluate the impact of habitat alteration on the composition of anoline lizard communities. Five species of Anolis (A. bahorucoensis, A. barahonae, A. coelestinus, A. cybotes, A. distichus) are known to occur in the immediate area of our study sites. Only three were found in the most substantially altered clear-cut site, whereas all five species occupied the most heterogeneous habitat, a coffee plantation characterized by a three-tiered canopy. Similarly, numbers of individuals of all but one species were greatest in the plot that most closely resembled the natural forests in this area. Calculated niche breadths, based on analysis of stomach contents, of the three species found in all sites increased with the degree of habitat alteration. The higher number of A coelestinus in more heavily altered sites may be attributed to density compensation.

AB The fifteen articles in this special issue describe long-term (greater than or equal to 5 years) responses or perspectives on disturbance in Caribbean ecosystems. Most (11) of the articles describe the responses of Caribbean forests to hurricane disturbance, particularly the effects of Hurricane Hugo on wet forest in the Luquillo Experimental Forest (LEF), Puerto Rico. Ten articles discuss, alone or in addition to hurricanes, the effects of other types of disturbance including that due to humans, treefalls, drought, and landslides. In this introductory article we summarize the post-hurricane trajectories of various ecosystem components in the LEE We also address how responses to other types of disturbance can be brought together to obtain a more thorough understanding of the comparative responses of Caribbean ecosystems to different disturbances. Finally we identify those areas of disturbance ecology in the Caribbean that require further investigation.

AB Five years after Hurricane Hugo reduced the aboveground biomass by 50 percent in two forested watersheds in the Luquillo Experimental Forest of Puerto Rico, regeneration and growth of survivors had increased the aboveground biomass to 86 percent of the pre-hurricane value. Over the 5 yr, the net aboveground productivity averaged 21.6 Mg . ha(-1). yr(-1) and was faster than most plantations and secondary forests in the area. Woodfall and associated nutrient fluxes never attained pre-storm values bur by the fifth yr, mean daily coral litterfall, and N, P, K, Ca, and fluxes in litterfall were 83, 74, 62, 98, 75, and 81 percent of their pre-disturbance values, respectively. Aboveground nutrient pools of these nutrients ranged from 102 to 161 percent of their pre-disturbance values and were larger after 5 yr because of higher nutrient concentrations in the regeneration compared to the older wood that it replaced. The following sequence of ecosystem reorganization during this first 5 yr period is suggested. An initial period of foliage production and crown development occurred as hurricane survivors re-leafed and herbaceous vegetation and woody regeneration became established. During this period, 75 to 92 percent of the nutrient uptake was retained in the aboveground vegetation and there was a relatively low rate of aboveground carbon accumulation per mole of nutrient cycled. This initial period of canopy development was followed by a peak in aboveground productivity that occurred as early successional species entered the sapling and pole stages. This period was followed by the establishment of the litterfall nutrient cycle and an increase in the net productivity per mole of nutrient cycled. During this 5 yr period, the Bisley Forest had some of the lowest within-stand nutrient-use-efficiencies and some of the highest levels of aboveground productivity ever observed in the LEE The study demonstrates char high levels of productivity and rapid rates of aboveground reorganization can be achieved with rapid within-system cycling and inefficient within-stand nutrient use.

AB We monitored the effects of both harvesting aboveground biomass and Hurricane Hugo on soil chemical and physical properties, and live and dead root biomass over 6 yr in a subtropical wet forest in Puerto Rico. Our goal was to determine how belowground processes changed at different temporal scales including the immediate period prior to revegetation (9 wk), the intermediate period of initial regrowth (9 mo), and the longer-term reorganization of the vegetation and biogeochemical cycling (6 yr). Harvesting resulted in temporary increases in the availability of exchangeable nutrients, but forest floor and soil nutrient pools had generally returned to pre-harvest values over a 3 wk period. Significant amounts of K moved through the soil over this time period, amounting to 23-46 kg/ha(-1), and resulting in a reduction in the size of the exchangeable soil K pool. The hurricane deposited approximately 845 kg/ha(-1) of forest floor mass and considerable nutrients on the soil surface, and increased soil NO3-N and exchangeable K pools, but in all cases, pool sizes had returned re pre-hurricane values within 3 mo. Examination of the data on an annual time step over the G yr period revealed an increase in soil cation pools and a significant decrease in soil pH. No change in soil organic matter was detected at any time step following the disturbances. Live fine root biomass was dramatically reduced as a result of the hurricane, and was only beginning to show signs of recovery near the end of the G yr experiment.

AB Litterfall (fine and coarse) due to Hurricane Hugo and subsequent fine annual litterfall inputs (1, 2 and 5 yr after Hugo) were determined for two sites (El Verde and Bisley) in the Luquillo Experimental Forest in Puerto Rico. Litter transfers into streams, riparian and upslope areas were determined within each catchment. The recovery rate of aboveground fine litterfall (leaf, line wood <1 cm diameter, and other miscellaneous inputs) to predisturbance levels were determined 1, 2, and 5 yr after Hurricane Hugo. The amount of total litter transfers and their individual components into the riparian and upslope areas due to Hurricane Hugo varied significantly by catchments within the Luquillo Experimental Forest. Ar El Verde, 26-39 percent, 31-35 percent, 14-35 percent and 7-12 percent of the coral litter transfers were contributed by leaf litter, tine wood, coarse wood and fine roots, respectively. Ar Bisley, 28-31 percent, 26-29 percent, 33-35 percent and 8-10 percent of the litter transfers were contributed by the same categories. Differential decay rates contributed to the relative importance of fine and coarse litter inputs. The recovery of fine aboveground litterfall to pre-hurricane levels after 5 yr varied by topographic location (streams had the slowest recovery, upslope areas the highest) and catchment (El Verde: 55-77%; Bisley: 39-82% of pre-hurricane values).

AB Anthropogenic and natural disturbances play critical roles in affecting the structure and function of Caribbean ecosystems, where hurricanes represent important disturbances superimposed on a landscape modified by human agricultural and forestry practices. Based on the differential catabolism of a suite of 128 carbon sources by soil bacterial communities, we focus on four aspects of functional diversity (coral substrate activity, substrate richness, substrate evenness, substrate diversity) in the tabonuco forest of puerto Rico, and assess the degree to which their spatial variability is a consequence of historical landuse or impacts of Hurricane Hugo. Considerable microspatial heterogeneity characterizes the functional diversity of forest soil communities, but the degree of hurricane damage to aboveground plant communities is positively related to al four indexes of Functional diversity 5yr after the hurricane. No differences in Functional diversity were detected with respect to historical landuse, after controlling for the effects of hurricane damage. However, this lack of significance may be an artifact because the spatial distribution of hurricane damage is not independent of historical landuse. As a consequence, contemporary studies of spatial heterogeneity that do nor account for historical patterns of anthropogenic or natural disturbance may yield spurious or incorrect conclusions. Long-term studies help to rectify this problem and are especially important within the context of evaluating the impacts of increasing human demands on natural ecosystems.

AB Different intensities and frequencies of disturbances can alter spatial and temporal patterns of abundances for coexisting species. We observed the effects of a high-flow event generated by Hurricane Hugo (19 September 1989) and below-normal stream flow during 1934 on freshwater shrimp populations in a tropical, montane scream. To determine if these different hydrologic regimes altered distributions of populations, we compared shrimp densities during three periods: pre-Hurricane Hugo (20 mo), post-Hurricane Hugo (50 mo), and low-flow (12 mo). There were significant differences in the relationships between locations of scream pools along an elevational gradient (300 to 470 m) and the abundances of two species of shrimp (Atya lanipes and Xiphocaris elongata) during these three periods. Atya increased in density with increasing elevation in a consistent fashion during all three periods. Densities also increased during the post-Hugo and low-flow periods relative to the pre-Hugo baseline. Xiphocaris increased in density with increasing elevation during the pre- and post-Hugo periods, but density decreased with elevation during the low-flow period. Palaemonid species of predatory shrimp, Macrobrachium carcinus and Macrobrachium crenulatum, consistently decreased in density with elevation during all three periods of observation.
   Multiple regression analyses demonstrated high predictability of Atya density distributions based on volume, pool depth, and coefficient of variation of pool depth during the pre-Hugo baseline observations. Xiphocaris densities were positively associated with pool width and negatively associated with the coefficient of variation of pool width in the pre-Hugo period. However, physical variables did not predict Atya or Xiphocaris densities during the post-Hugo period. During the dry period, there was a negative association between Atya densities and pool depth and width, and a positive association with the coefficient of variation of pool depth. During the dry period, Xiphocaris densities were best predicted as a function of maximum depth; there was a negative association with the coefficient of variation of pool width. Pre-Hugo Macrobrachium densities were negatively associated with the coefficient of variation of pool width, pool width-to-depth ratio, and elevation; in the post-Hugo and dry periods, Macrobrachium densities were best predicted by elevation. Mechanisms that likely cause these patterns of distribution include avoidance of predators coupled with active preference by prey species for pool habitats with low frequency of washout by storm flows, and with sufficient storage of food resources (microbially conditioned leaf detritus).

AB Population estimates from 1987 to 1995 are reported for the terrestrial anuran, Eleutherodactylus coqui, from four long-term study plots in the Luquillo Experimental Forest of northeastern Puerto Rico. The major factor influencing population size during this time was Hurricane Hugo, which deposited much of the canopy onto the forest floor in 1989. This increase in ground-level structure was in parr responsible for a six-fold increase in the number of adult frogs in 1990 and a large increase in the number of juvenile frogs in 1991. Population densities since Hurricane Hugo have been influenced by succession, with continued high densities associated with thickets of Cecropia and Heliconia. Treefalls, which are similar to hurricanes on a local scale, also were shown to influence population sizes. Years with prolonged dry periods reduced numbers of juvenile frogs, but rainfall patterns alone did not explain most population variation. Population levels of invertebrate predators were related to variation in frog numbers.

AB Despite recent studies of the effect of disturbance on the abundance and distribution of organisms, little research has focused on the legacy of infrequent and large scale disturbances, especially from the perspective of habitat associations of animals. In 1989, Hurricane Hugo caused considerable damage re the Luquillo Experimental Forest of Puerto Rico, with the degree of disturbance strongly affected by topogeographic considerations. We examined the abundance, distribution, and habitat associations of four species of land snail (Caracolus caracolla, Nenia tridens, Gaeotis nigrolineata, Polydantes acutangula) in the tabonuco forest at two sites (El Verde and Bisley) which were differentially damaged by the hurricane. Five years after the impact of Hurricane Hugo, significant differences between sites in density persisted for all snails except P. acutangula. Moreover, significant differences in habitat characteristics (central tendency and dispersion) were detected between El Verde and Bisley based on univariate and multivariate analyses of a suite of 31 abiotic and biotic variables. Despite these differences, the basis of habitat association for each snail did not differ between sites. The factors that affected microspatial differences in snail density within sires accounted for differences in density between sires. Insight derived from research conducted at a single location (e.g., El Verde) adequately accounted for patterns of variation at another site (e.g., Bisley), even though differences between sites in the extent and severity of damage were well-documented. We hypothesize chat the absence of scale-dependence with regard to habitat selection exists because the association among abiotic and biotic variables (character correlation matrix) within sires was nor altered differentially by the hurricane or has recovered to a similar stare as a consequence of secondary succession.

AB We compared forest structure over a 12 yr period (1982-1994) that included measurements before and after a severe hurricane in two forests: a 64 yr old Swietenia macrophylla tree plantation and a paired natural forest of similar age in a subtropical wet Forest life zone at 200 m elevation in Puerto Rico. We measured trees greater than or equal to 4 cm diameter at breast height in a 40 X 50 m plot at each forest type. The natural forest had lower total tree height (8.8 vs. 10.2 m in 1984), and greater basal area (35.7 vs. 28.5 m(2)/ha in 1989) and tree density (1525 vs. 969 trees/ha in 1989) than the plantation. Rates of tree mortality and ingrowth to the greater than or equal to 4 cm diameter class were higher in the plantation than in the natural forest. Both forest types exhibited the same rare of change in these structural parameters before and after Hurricane Hugo. However, Hurricane Hugo caused a greater reduction in the rate of change of tree density and basal area of the plantation than it did in the natural forest. After the hurricane, the plantation experienced a greater fluctuation in tree species composition and tree species abundance than did the natural forest. Tree ingrowth was lower than tree mortality in both stands. By 1994, all measured rates of change were at pre-hurricane levels. The species composition and structural changes required to make the plantation more productive in terms of stemwood biomass appear to make the plantation more vulnerable to hurricane wind effects and this in turn causes greater rates of change in species composition, tree mortality, and tree ingrowth during the initial phase following the disturbance.

AB Anthropogenic alteration of the landscape is a long-term disturbance both in duration and consequences. This study addresses land-cover responses to a history of human land use in northeastern Puerto Rico. Analysis of aerial photographs indicated that the pattern of land use in the municipality of Luquillo changed dramatically between 1936 and 1988. In 1936, sugar cane and pasture were the dominant land uses, occupying about one third of the study area each, while dense forest was rare. Pasture still occupied about a quarter of the area by 1988, but the area of sugar cane had declined to zero. Most sugar cane land was transformed to pasture after abandonment, while much of the pasture at higher elevations reverted to forest. More than half the study area in 1988 was occupied by dense forest, and the degree of forest regeneration was greatest adjacent to the Luquillo Experimental Forest and around parches that were dense forest remnants in 1936. The overall trend was from high-intensity agriculture to dense forest, bur urban areas increased more than 2000 percent between 1936 and 1988 and are presently encroaching on forested areas. It is unclear from one study whether the same pattern would hold true at other sites in the tropics, but our study indicates the importance of preserving remnants of mature forest as sources of forest regeneration. In addition, the nature of the patches in the Luquillo landscape has changed as the land use has changed. In 1936, dense forest was highly fragmented, the patches were small and many of them had linear configurations (riparian corridors and hedgerows). By 1988, the average parch size of dense forest had increased greatly, although with one exception the parches were still small relative to other land-cover types.

AB A major cause of tropical deforestation has been the conversion of lowland forest into pastures for cattle grazing. We studied forest structure and species composition following abandonment of cattle pastures in 23 abandoned pastures 9.5-60 yr old and seven forested sites > 60 yr old. Sires were chosen along an elevational gradient from 10-450 m and represented subtropical wet and moist forest life zones. Age since abandonment was the best predictor of stand characteristics. Woody plant density, basal area, species number, and diversity were low 10 yr after abandonment, but increased rapidly after 10 to 15 yr pose-abandonment. Although distance to nearest seed source and hurricane exposure are factors char could affect forest recovery there was little variation among sires and no effects were detected. Elevation and age were significant determinants of species composition. At higher elevations (> 100 m), the shrub Miconia prasina (Melastomataceae) was the dominant pioneer species, bur in the low elevation, a larger group of shrubs and small trees colonized abandoned pastures. At higher elevations, the species composition of recovering sires did nor include many mature forest species. After 40 yr of recovery, secondary forest stands cannot be distinguished from undisturbed sites in terms of density, basal area, species number, or diversity, but it appears that it will require centuries for these sires to return to a species composition similar to undisturbed forests.

AB We review historical, current, and projected future impacts of four classes of anthropogenic disturbance-extraction, pollution, reclamation, and changing climate-on Caribbean mangrove ecosystems (mangal). These disturbances occur, respectively, at increasing spatial and temporal scales, and require increasing recovery rime. Small-scale selective extraction has little system-wide effect, but regeneration is slow even on single hectare clear-cuts due to rapid soil acidification. Petroleum is the primary pollutant of Caribbean mangal, and results in tree defoliation, stand death, and loss of associated sessile and mobile animal species. Hydrocarbons persist in mangrove sediments for decades, and are correlated with increasing seedling mutation rates. Chemical, industrial, and urban wastes are associated with increased heavy metal content of seedlings, stand die-back, reduced system-wide species richness, and higher incidence of Vibrio spp. (shellfish poisoning). Mangal has been reclaimed for urbanization, industrialization, and increasingly, for tourism. Overall, the region is losing mangrove forests at approximate to 1 percent per yr, although the rate is much faster on the Caribbean mainland (approximate to 1.7% yr(-1)) than it is on the islands (approximate to 0.2% yr(-1)). The region's fisheries are declining at a similar rate, as most commercial shellfish and finfish use mangal for nurseries and/or refugia. Few Caribbean states have legislation or enforcement capabilities to protect or manage mangal, although at least 11 international treaties and conventions could be applied to conserve or sustainably use these forests. These treaties may protect riverine and basin mangal, but are likely to be moot with respect to fringing mangal, which may vanish as a consequence of global climate change. Growth enhancements of mangroves resulting from increasing atmospheric CO2 probably will not compensate for negative effects of concomitant rises in regional sea level.

AB Landslides are common in mountainous regions of the Caribbean and are triggered by heavy rains and earthquakes, and often occur in association with human disturbances (e.g., roads). Spatially heterogeneous removal of both substrate and vegetation is responsible for a variety of patterns of ecosystem development and plant successional trajectories within Caribbean landslides. Soil nutrient pools in exposed mineral soils reach levels comparable to mature forest soils within 55 yr bur soil organic matter recovers more slowly. Plant colonization of landslides depends on the availability of propagules and suitable sites for germination, soil stability, and the presence of residual or newly deposited soil organic matter and associated nutrients. Once initial colonization occurs, the rate and trajectory of plane succession on landslides is strongly affected by plant/plane interactions. We present two conceptual models of landslide succession that summarize the major processes and pathways of ecosystem development and plant succession on landslides. Additional work is needed to characterize interactions between spacially heterogeneous zones, control over soil development, impacts of key plant species, and the role of animals on Caribbean landslides.

AB The long-term response of shallow groundwater chemistry to the canopy disturbance and defoliation associated with Hurricane Hugo was studied at two sites in the Luquillo Experimental Forest, Puerto Rico. The sites differed in bedrock type, dominant vegetation, and availability of pre-hurricane data. At the primary study site, the Bisley catchment, hurricane disturbance resulted in increased concentrations of NO3-, NH4+, dissolved organic N, base cations, Cl-, and SiO2 in groundwater within 5 mo of the hurricane. The largest relative change in concentration occurred for K+, which increased from 0.7 to as high as 13 mg/L; concentrations were still 1.3 mg/L 5.5 yr after the hurricane. Most other solutes had returned to background levels within 1-2 yr of the hurricane. At the secondary study sire, the Icacos catchment, NO3- concentrations peaked at 1.1 mg/L one yr after the hurricane and decreased to nearly zero 5.5 yr after the hurricane. Ar both sires, NO concentrations were higher in upslope wells than in those closer to the stream. Overall, riparian processes appear to reduce but not eliminate hydrologic losses of N following catastrophic disturbance. The nature of the long-term biogeochemical response to disturbance in this tropical rain forest ecosystem is similar to that observed in some montane temperate forests, and the time course of recovery appears to be associated with the speed with which vegetation regrows following disturbance.

AB The process of tree mortality has dimensions of intensity spatial, and temporal scales that reflect the characteristics of endogenic processes (i.e., senescence) and exogenic disturbances (i.e., severity, frequency, duration, spatial scale, and points of interaction with the ecosystem. Tree mortality events expressed as percent of stems or biomass per unit area, range in intensity from background (<5% yr(-1)) to catastrophic (>5% yr-l), in spatial scale from local to massive, and in temporal scale from gradual to sudden (hours to weeks). Absolute annual rates of background tree mortality (biomass or stem ha(-1) yr(-1)) can vary several fold depending on stand conditions and tend to increase with stem density. The ecological effects of a catastrophic, massive, and sudden tree mortality event contrast with those of background, local, and gradual tree mortality in terms of the direction of succession after the event, community dynamics, nutrient cycling, and possibly selection on trees. When standardized for the return frequency of disturbance events, area, and topography, the ranking of tree mortality events (trees ha(-1) century(-1)) in the Luquillo Experimental Forest is: background > hurricanes > individual tree fall gaps > landslides. Estimates of vegetation turnover rates require long-term and spatial analysis to yield accurate results.

AB The theory of competition is modified to include the effects of disturbance as a force that can set back the process of competitive exclusion. Disturbance may be of three Forms, density dependent, density independent and quasi-dependent. It is shown analytically that the quasi-dependent form is incapable of setting back the competitive process to avoid competitive exclusion, while either the density dependent form or the density independent form can. The basic theor is tested with data on changes in tree population densities since the landfall of Hurricane Joan in Nicaragua. It is found that this catastrophic event indeed did have the effect of reducing competitive dominance and thus preserving species diversity Furthermore, the effect was density independent.

However, it is unclear whether these short-stature forests result from edaphic properties that limit the development of taller-stature dry forest or result from the repeated harvest of wood. To investigate the influence of edaphic properties on forest composition and structure, we sampled 21 stands within the dry forest life zone of St. Lucia. Mean canopy height in the scrub forest was 4 m and stands contained an average of 39,407 stems ha(-1); 96 percent of those stems were less than or equal to 5 cm in diameter. Mean basal area in the scrub forest (stems greater than or equal to 1.0 cm DBH) was 15 m(2) ha(-1), 62 percent of which consisted of stems less than or equal to 5 cm in diameter Guettarda scabra (Rubiaceae) and Croton spp. (Euphorbiaceae) were the most common species. Soil organic C averaged 3.2 percent, potential net N mineralization was 1.49 mu g N g(-1) d(-1), and potential net nitrification was 1.61 mu g NO3--N g(-1) d(-1). Concentrations of available P ranged from 1 to 3 mg kg(-1). We found no relationship between vegetation and soil properties in the scrub forest of St. Lucia. Moreover, most soil properties in the short-stature scrub forest did not significantly differ from those of relatively undisturbed tropical dry forest in our study area, even though overstory composition and structure differed dramatically. Rates of net N mineralization in the scrub forest were 57 percent of those in a relatively undisturbed dry forest; chat difference was significant. The similarity of soil properties between short-stature scrub forest and relatively undisturbed dry forest suggest that repeated disturbance, rather than edaphic properties, is a major influence on forest composition and structure within the dry forest zone of St. Lucia.

AB We studied during 9 months the diversity, abundance, and richness of Myxomycetes growing on fallen logs in a ravine covered with tropical humid forest in Mexico. We collected and described 951 specimens ascribed to 33 species and one variety Corresponding, and 1 and 2 months shifted-back correlations, were done between diversity, abundance and richness, and the climatic variables. We found significant correlations between diversity and precipitation in corresponding form, and between diversity and temperature at 1 month shift-back. Abundance and richness were only significantly correlated with precipitation at 2 months shift-back. The results suggest a general induction of spore germination of the dominant species with the onset of rains coupled with the increase of environmental temperatures. Finally, we suggest that the scarcity of fruiting bodies in this type of ecosystem is due to the capacity of these organisms to stay for longer periods in a plasmodia etcher than in the sporangia stage.

AB Seedlings of three tree species of lowland tropical rain forest in Singapore grown in pots of forest soil at low irradiance were subjected to simulated drought and nutrient addition treatments. The gravimetric soil water contents applied during drought simulations were within the range found during an eight-month survey of soil moisture content at 10 understory sites in primary forest in Singapore. Aspects of plant growth and dry mass allocation were influenced strongly by simulated drought for all three species. Morphological responses to the low-frequency watering regime were similar to those described for herbaceous crop plants subjected to water shortage, and suggest chat the tree seedlings used are capable of withstanding substantial periods of low soil water availability. In addition, analysis of covariance showed that height and leaf area growth of seedlings of Antidesma cuspidatum were limited by Mg and height growth of seedlings of Vatica maingayi by one or more macro-nutrients. These results suggest that tree seedlings of tropical lowland rain forests may be limited by the availability of soil resources, as well as irradiance, when growing in deep shade.

AB Litterfall was measured monthly during three years in a lower montane forest at 1225 m in central Veracruz, Mexico. The focus was to determine litterfall inputs by dominant tree species from different phytogeographical affinities, and their relation to precipitation and temperature. Total annual litterfall was 8.45 +/- 0.18 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) (mean +/- 1 SE), of which 70 percent were leaves, 15 percent woody pans, 3 percent reproductive pans, and 12 percent unclassified. Leaf liner was separated into holarctic and tropical species. Holarctic species (Carpinus caroliniana, Liquidambar macrophylla and Quercus spp.) leaf litter was 4.86 +/- 0.31 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1), and tropical species (Turpinia insignis, Clethra mexicana, Ocotea psychotrioides and Eugenia xalapensis) was 1.03 +/- 0.11 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1). No significant differences were found among years. Significant differences were found among months, and pronounced seasonal patterns in litterfall were observed. Tora litterfall and leaf litter of holarctic species showed strong negative correlations with precipitation and minimum temperatures. In contrast, a significant positive correlation of litterfall with maximum temperature was found for tropical species. Litterfall production by individual tree species is related to their phytogeographical origin.

AB Leaf decomposition in five common species was studied in the Los Tuxtlas tropical rain forest, Veracruz state, Mexico. The species were: Nectandra ambigens (Blake) C. K. Allen, Pseudolmedia oxyphyllaria Donn. Sm, Dussia mexicana (Standl.) Harms, Ficus yoponensis Desvaux and Poulsenia armata (Mig.) Standl. Two experimental studies were done using litter bags, one comparing hat and slope conditions, and the second one in closed canopy and gap conditions. In addition, decomposition was compared between the dry and rainy season.
   There were significant differences in decomposition rates between species and seasons, but not between zones (flat and gentle slope, and dosed forest and gap conditions). The highest decomposition rates were observed for species with high nutrient contents, and also during the rainy season. The data were hued to three mathematical models derived from the negative simple exponential; the double exponential model for decay was significant. Also, the negative, simple, exponential model which assumes that k is nor constant, turned out to be significant for the experiment in dosed canopy and gap conditions.

AB The phenology of 568 trees of 49 species producing fleshy fruits was studied in a montane forest in Rwanda between January 1991 and January 1993. Fruiting peaked during the major wet season in March-May, bur remained high during the major dry season in July-August. A period of reduced fruiting occurred in the beginning of each calendar year during the minor dry period.
   Leaf flushing peaked during the major dry season in July-August, whereas flowering peaked in the beginning of each calendar year. These observations were inconsistent with the general pattern predicted by an ''insolation-limitation hypothesis'' that community-wide flowering and leaf flushing in tropical forests should be closely related in time and that both phenophases reach their peaks during the period of the most intense insolation.
   When species were grouped by seed size, the large-seeded group displayed a greater temporal variation in fruit abundance (greater fruiting seasonality) than the small-seeded group. When species were examined individually however, seed size was not related to either fruiting duration or within-species fruiting synchrony, two attributes determining the degree of fruiting seasonality of a species. Fruiting patterns manifested by a group rhus could not be explained by attributes from species constituting the group. Different degrees of fruiting seasonality displayed by different seed-sized groups may be due to different degrees of within-group interspecific fruiting synchrony.

AB We studied the inflorescence phenology, floral biology,, insect visitation, and pollen transport of the vegetable ivory palm Phytelephas seemannii in tropical rain forest at the Pacific coast of Colombia. Inflorescences warm up before and during anthesis. Male inflorescences open mostly by day and females at night. Visitors include Coleoptera (Staphylinidae, Nitidulidae, Curculionidae, Scarabaeidae), Diptera (Drosophilidae, Sphaeroceridae), Hymenoptera (Apidae, Vespidae), and Acarina, which are attracted to the male inflorescences by pollen and breeding opportunities. Female inflorescences apparently offer no reward, and they attract visitors by odor mimicry. Pollination rakes place from dawn and throughout the daytime, and is mostly carried our by three species of pollen-eating Amazoncharis (Staphylinidae: Aleocharinae) and by their predators, Xanthopygus (Staphylinidae: Staphylininae). Amazoncharis reproduces in the male inflorescences by constructing egg chambers in the fleshy receptacle of the flowers. This reproductive behavior resembles that of beetles in the closely related subtribe Gyrophaenina that reproduce in fleshy mushrooms, whose spores they eat. We suggest that the fleshy structure of the male flowers' receptacle in this species is an adaptation to the pollination by egg chamber constructing Alaeocharinae.

AB Seed dispersal of C. priscus was studied in a semideciduous forest in S.E. Brazil. C. priscus is a pioneer tree, with abundant capsules containing three elaiosome-bearing seeds. The seeds are explosively dispersed and the mean ballistic dispersal distance for two trees were 3.2 and 3.4 m. The explosive ejection of seeds is followed by ant exploitation. Eleven ant species were attracted to the elaiosomes of the seeds, bur only two species regularly removed seeds. On average, Atta sexdens and Pheidole sp. 1 move seeds 2.5 and 1.0 m, respectively. The ants usually deposit the seeds in the nest. The seed removal rate was 88 percent: (N = 100) over the first 24 hr of exposure. Our results indicate that elaiosome removal by ants probably does not improve germination rates in C. priscus. Seeds without elaiosomes and seedlings of C. priscus were frequent on refuse piles of ant nest in the study area, suggesting that transport of the seeds by Attini and Pheidolini may provide beneficial effects in the Croton system.

AB We hypothetized that termitaries of Cubitermes with their alveolate structure might constitute good shelters for ant colonies. We tested this hypothesis in 10 forests of southern Cameroon where we assessed a density of 124.48 +/- 13.6 Cubitermes fungifaber and C. banksi termitaries (both active and abandoned) per ha. Our work was undertaken on 725 termitaries among which we distinguished three groups: active, vertical (358); abandoned, vertical (220); and fallen abandoned (147). The rate of termitaries sheltering ant societies is higher for those which are abandoned (92.5% for fallen ones; 83.6% for vertical ones) than for chose which are active (43.8%). We recorded 799 ant societies belonging to 37 genera and 151 species, of which 11 are undescribed. We found up to six ant colonies per termitary. These termitaries, which are frequent in the understory, thus proved to be good shelters for ant societies. Moreover, this represents one of the highest levels of diversity of ants ever recorded, although these termitaries correspond to a limited area in comparison co that represented by the soil and leaf litter, rotten wood lying on the ground, or trees trunks and canopy.
   These results imply that in the rain forest the scarcity of nesting sites is one of the principal factors limiting the populations of ground-dwelling ants. The termitaries sampled also sheltered 103 incipient ant colonies (12.9% of the total number of societies) which belong principally to the Formicinae (71.7% of the societies of Formicinae recorded were incipient; 4.3% for the Ponerinae; 5.9% for the Myrmicinae and 0% for the Cerapachyinae and the Dolichoderinae). Depending on the subfamily, the Cubitennes termitaries are used as shelter only during foundation (Formicinae) or during che entire life cycle (ocher subfamilies).

The area is isolated from the surrounding forest and has reduced trophic resources and few potential predators of lizards. The population is characterized by the small size of the lizards and by low density (22.1 indv/ha). Probably the special characteristics of the habitat make possible the lengthened daily activity pattern in both juvenile and adult individuals, but this pattern is also related to relative humidity. The juveniles showed a unimodal pattern with maximum frequency of sightings at midday, while the adults preferred the morning and afternoon hours. Both age groups used open, sunny areas and spent most of their time in foraging and basking behaviors.

AB The diet and feeding habits of the Resplendent Quetzal (Pharomachrus m. mocinno) were studied in the cloud forest of the ''El Triunfo'' Biosphere Reserve, Chiapas, Mexico. Adults fed on fruits of 15 plant species, six of which (40%) are members of the family Lauraceae; 63 percent of the fruit items consumed were from these species. Other fruit items consumed were from species belong to the families Theaceae (8.3%) and, with 4.2 percent each: Myrsinaceae, Araliaceae, Verbenaceae, Solanaceae, Myrtaceae, Melasomataceae, Moraceae and Clusiaceae. Quetzals took fruits on the wing from distal branches of trees. Feeding activity was highest in the late afternoon hours. Average sex ratio in feeding groups was 1:1. The diet of chicks consisted of fruits (24%) and insects and small vertebrates (76%) during their first 10 d, and 72 percent fruits and 28 percent animal food from then until hedging. Large fruits increased and soft bodied animals decreased significantly in the chick's diet between these two periods. Of the plant species fed to the chick 37.5 percent belonged co the family Lauraceae. Of the coral fruit items, 50 percent belonged to this family, in contrast to higher proportions reported for P. m. costaricensis. In the overall chick's diet, Lauraceous fruit made up 19 percent, close to that reported for P. m. costaricensis. Other bird species that took fruit From the same trees as the quetzals fed from the inner branches while perching and fed mainly on non-lauraceous fruits, with small seeds. Our results support the view that che quetzal is a specialized frugivore, feeding mainly on fruits of the family Lauraceae. Quetzals may play an important role as seed dispersal agents especially during the non-breeding season, when they move up to 3 km/d, adding up co several dozen km in a season.

AB Stem density, basal area, the vertical distribution (0-25 cm) of roots (<2 mm and <5 mm) and its biomass were studied in a 10-year-old, a 20-year-old and a mature forest at La Planada cloud forest. There was an increase in canopy height (5-6 m to 20-22 m) and basal area (8.3 to 21.1 m(2) ha(-1)) with increasing forest age, and a decrease in stem density (17,466 to 651 stems >2.5 cm ha(-1)). In all three forests, there was an exponential reduction in root biomass with increasing depth. Root biomass (<5 mm) in the first 10 cm of the soil, measured with soil cores on flat terrain, was not significantly different among the three successional stages (3.46, 3.71, 4.00 Mg ha(-1), respectively). In contrast, the microtopography of the forest floor becomes more variable with increasing forest age. This increase in the surface roughness seems co be the result of increasing accumulation of dead logs and large branches that provide space for the expansion of root systems. Indeed, the aboveground root biomass (<5 mm) was higher in the mature forest (6.03 Mg ha(-1)) than in the 10-year-old successional forest (2.85 Mg ha(-1)). If changes in microtopography represent such an important resource for root growth, dead logs may be a key controlling factor in the succession of the aboveground biomass and structure of montane rain forests.

AB The reproductive biology of the threatened, endemic and economically important palm species (Neodypsis decaryi) of Madagascar was studied in order to understand its interaction with pollinators. Inflorescences were monoecious, protandrous, and primarily insect pollinated. The honey bee Apis mellifera was the most effective pollinator although there were other insect visitors. None of these visitors were specialists restricted to N. decaryi.
   The Neodypsis decaryi populations examined in this study produced staminate flowers continuously all year long, but fruit production was highly seasonal. Our hypothesis is that continuous staminate flower production throughout the year may provide a reliable food resource for flower visitors and habituate the pollinators to the system. Fruit set is low and appears to be associated with both water resource and pollen limitation.

AB We measured che diameter at breast height of all trees and shrubs greater than or equal to 5 meters in height, including standing dead trees, on 68 0.04-hectare study plots in a montane, subtropical rain forest on Mauna Loa, Hawai'i. The canopy species consisted of 88 percent Metrosideros polymorpha (ohia) and 12 percent Acacia koa (koa). Negative associations were found between the densities of koa and ohia, the density of koa and the total basal area of ohia, and the total basal areas of koa and ohia. The two-species lottery competition model, a stochastic model in which the coexistence of two species in a space-limited community results from temporal variation in recruitment and death rates, predicts a quadratic-beta distribution for the proportion of space occupied by each species. A discrete version of the quadratic-beta distribution, the quadratic-beta binomial distribution, was fit to the live koa and ohia densities and assessed with goodness-of-fit tests. Likelihood ratio tests provided evidence that the mean adult death races of the two species were equal but that the relative competitive abilities of che two species favored ohia. These tests were corroborated by a contingency table analysis of death rates based on standing dead trees and growth rate studies which report that koa grows much faster than ohia. The lottery model predicts a positive covariance between death rates and ohia recruitment when mean death rates are equal and koa has a higher growth race than ohia. We argue that the competitive advantage of ohia is due to its superior dispersal ability into large gaps, which would yield the positive covariance described above, and ic is this positive covariance term chat skews the occupation of space in favor of ohia.

AB Global concern over rising atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide is stimulating development and implementation of policies aimed at reducing net greenhouse gas emissions by enhancing carbon sinks. One option for reducing net emissions is to lessen damage to residual forests during selective logging, thereby retaining additional carbon in biomass. A pilot carbon offset project was initiated in Sabah, Malaysia, in 1992 in which a power company provided funds to a timber concessionaire to implement guidelines aimed at reducing logging damage; in doing so, the utility gained potential credit towards future emissions reduction requirements. To quantify the carbon retained due to this effort we compared dipterocarp, forests logged according to reduced-impact logging guidelines with forests logged by conventional methods in terms of the above- and below-ground biomass both before and after logging. Prior to logging, the forest stored approximately 400 Mg biomass ha(-1), 17 percent of which was belowground. High volumes of timber were removed from both of the logging areas (mean CNV = 154, Rn = 104 m(3)ha(-1)). Ferry-one percent of the unharvested trees <60 M DBH were severely damaged (uprooted and crushed) from logging in conventional logging areas in contrast to 15 percent in reduced-impact logging areas. Approximately 18 and 12 percent, respectively, of the remaining residual trees in conventional and reduced-impact logging areas suffered less severe damage (e.g., crown or bark damage). Mortality rates of the less severely damaged trees in all DBH classes were higher during the first year in conventional logging areas than in reduced-impact logging areas. One yr post harvest, conventional and reduced-impact logging areas contained biomass equivalent to about 44 percent and 67 percent of pre-logging levels, respectively. Approximately 62 percent of the difference in carbon retention was due to fewer trees killed in the reduced-impact logging areas; the remaining 38 percent was due to a lower mass of branches, stumps and waste wood from felled trees in reduced-impact logging areas. Mortality of damaged trees in both areas may contribute to net decreases in biomass for several years after logging. More and larger trees remained undamaged where reduced-impact logging was practiced, hence future biomass increment and yields of marketable timber are expected to be greater in the reduced-impact logging areas than in conventional logging areas.

AB This paper examines the impact of selective logging and two silvicultural treatments (enrichment strips and vine cutting) on understory birds in southern Venezuela. Birds were sampled using mist nets from 1932-93. Assemblages in each forest type were compared with reference plots in primary forest. While selective logging significantly affected understory bird assemblages, the effects were even greater when enrichment strips (Linear plantations) were created following harvesting. Bird assemblages changed in proportion to the magnitude of the forestry disturbances. With increasing disturbance, nectarivores increased in abundance while the responses of frugivores were mixed. Insectivores dominated the understory avifauna and generally declined in abundance. The most diverse family of understory birds, the antbirds (Formicariidae), was typical of insectivores. Of the 22 species which occur in primary forest, a few (two spp.) became abundant following selective logging, but most (16 spp.) declined and several (four spp.) were not recorded in logged forest. Compositional changes and the frequency of extirpations were even greater following the creation of enrichment strips. Eliminating this silvicultural practice, or replacing it with a less damaging alternative, would better conserve the forest avifauna. Cutting vines, which did not greatly alter the structure of the forest understory, had little effect on understory birds.

AB We assessed effects of selective logging of rain forest upon a diverse assemblage of folivorous (leaf-eating) marsupials in tropical Queensland, Australia. Spotlighting censuses of mammal populations were conducted for I-yr periods before logging (1886/87) and 3 yr after logging (1993/94), on a 150-ha sire in which an average of 8-10 trees/ha (50-55 m(3)/ha) were extracted. Two formerly logged ''reference sites'' were censused concurrently to assess effects of sampling variation and between-year population fluctuations on census results.
   Lemuroid ringtail possums (Hemibelideus lemuroides) declined markedly in logged forest, while three other possums (Pseudocheirops archeri, Trichosuras vulpecula, Pseudocheirus herbertensis) and a tree-kangaroo (Dendrolagus lumholtzi) did not differ significantly between pre- and pen-logging censuses. Folivores char are highly dependent upon primary forest clearly are most vulnerable to logging. The magnitude and duration of logging impacts on arboreal mammal populations is probably strongly affected by the level of forest structural damage incurred during logging operations. We suggest that ecological and behavioral traits such as the degree of arboreality, diet, denning requirements and territorial behavior influenced the responses of these marsupials to logging.

AB Ecological certification of forest products is a rapidly developing market-based incentive for better forest management. Improved forest management can be an important component of tropical conservation and development strategies. To provide a solid biophysical basis for certification programs, however, research is needed on the ecological and silvicultural consequences of different forest management practices. The current criteria for certification are generally based on sustainability of timber harvest volumes, protection of hydrological functions, maintenance of soil productivity and forest structure, and minimization of the deleterious impacts of forest management on non-commercial plants and animals. Some criteria and the field indicators used in their assessment apply equally well to most forests, whereas others are only appropriate for certain forest types, stands, or species. Tropical biologists can contribute to the processes of refining eco-certification criteria and selecting ecologically meaningful indicators of good forest management that can be readily assessed and monitored. participation of tropical biologists in the design of ecological certification protocols will improve credibility of the process and promote better forest stewardship.

AB Morphology and mineral levels of leaves of 19 secondary and 22 primary tree species were studied in Querrus-dominated upper montane 10-year-old Early Secondary Forest (ESF), 30-year-old Late Secondary Forest (LSF) and undisturbed Primary Forest (PF) in the Costa Rican Cordillera de Talamanca. In general, the predominant leaf is simple, elliptic, ent ire, and pinnately veined. Notophyllous and microphyllous-sized leaves dominate all spectra. During secondary succession the mean leaf area of secondary species tends to reduce 30 to 65 percent, while the average leaf area of primary species doubles. Primary species exhibit a greater mean leaf dry weight per unit area than secondary species. As succession proceeds, the mean leaf water content drops among secondary species and rises among primary species. During forest recovery levels of foliar nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium decline significantly. In leaves of species in ESF nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium are significantly correlated. Values for leaf characteristics recorded in Costa Rican montane ESF, LSF, and PF fall mainly within the ranges known from other tropical montane forests.

AB The distribution of vascular epiphytes was analyzed on three emergent trees (Hura crepitans, Ceiba pentandra, and Couratari stellata). A total number of 77 species, including 46 orchids, in 17 families was recorded. Number of species was highest in the center of the tree crowns while cover was highest in the middle third of the crown or equally distributed. This leads to the assumption that succession does not always reach equilibrium on old branches towards crown center. Distribution patterns of single species do not necessarily correspond to that of the total epiphyte mass. The entire epiphyte cover is highest on the top of branches while certain species, that could be discussed as specialists on the basis of particular life-form characteristics, are equally abundant on the bottom. There was no clear distribution pattern with respect to branch inclination. Distribution patterns are partly explained by the life-form of the plants.

AB The abundance of adventitious-root-climbing vines, predominantly Freycinetia excelsa and Piper caninum, on potential host trees was investigated in a north Queensland tropical rain forest. All trees 10 cm DBH and greater were measured and assessed For adventitious-root-climber presence. Additional trees of the 17 most abundant species were examined giving a total of 833 trees. Some 1694 adventitious-root climbing vines were recorded from the study area. Distribution over the rain forest trees was not homogeneous, bur exhibited host associations. Interspecific differences between potential host trees were analyzed in terms of allelopathy, bark characteristics, and gross morphological features. Bark characteristics are proposed.as the main factor for the relative absence of adventitious-root-climbing vines on trees of Syzgium papyraceum and Austromyrtus shepherdii. Thin, peeling, sloughable bark characterize these members of the Myrtaceae. Trees heavily infested by adventitious-root climbers include Beilschmiedia collina with non-descript (though slightly rough) bark providing a good, stable climbing surface with little phytotoxicity, and Citronella smythii, with thick, corky, fissured bark, also lacking allelopathic materials. Allelopathic effects of bark phytochemicals seem to be predominantly responsible for the absence of infestation of Alphitonia petriei by adventitious-root climbers.

AB The processing of leaf fitter in temperate streams has been the subject of numerous studies but equivalent tropical ecosystems have received little attention. The decomposition and macroinvertebrate colonisation of leaf litter was investigated using litter bags placed in a first-order rainforest stream over a 48 day period. Changes in leaf chemistry were also studied. Decay of the fresh, mixed-species litter was rapid (2.5% day(-1)) in comparison to char typically observed in temperate streams. The high water temperatures (21 degrees C) at the study sire are considered an important factor in the decay rate observed. Initially, average nitrogen content was high (3.5%). Content decreased to 3.1 percent after six days immersion and, thereafter, remained relatively constant. The consequent lack of evidence for microbial conditioning was attributed to species-specific differences in decay rare, giving rise to an overlapping sequence of conditioning and mineralisation of each leaf species within individual litter bags. Soluble polyphenols were largely leached from litter during the initial period of immersion. Constancy in remaining polyphenol content may be due to complexing with proteins and/or lignin compounds. The invertebrate community which colonised litter bags was dominated by insect groups and species richness was lower than that typical of many temperate streams. Colonisation dynamics differed among functional feeding groups: collector abundance increased on a linear basis whereas shredder and predator groups increased logarithmically. Despite differences in decay rate and taxonomic composition of the invertebrate community, the pattern of leaf litter utilisation and decay in the tropical stream studied was similar to that typically observed in temperate streams.

AB Allozyme and morphological variation among populations of an Amazonian frog were analyzed to test for a riverine effect on population differentiation. High levels of genetic diversity within populations and genetic diversification among populations were Found. Although correlations between generic and geographic distances of population pairs were positive, they were nor significant and indicated that sires that mere dose geographically were nor genetically more similar. Only one of the 15 polymorphic loci showed any variation in allozyme frequency attributable to the presence of the river, but none of the overall among-population component of allozyme frequency variation (F-ST = 0.368) can be attributed to the river (F-RT = 0.000). Significant differences in morphology (corrected for sire differences) were Found among the 11 populations in canonical variate space. In univariate Nested ANOVAs, five of the 12 morphological variables showed significant differences due to the presence of the river. However, cluster analysis performed on all morphological variables failed to detect obvious groups based on river bank locality. We could detect no congruence of pattern between morphological and generic variation among populations. These results suggest that morphological characters may evolve at different rates than detectable allozyme differentiation.

AB Anolis lizards (Iguanidae) were surveyed for malarial parasites on 14 islands in the eastern Lesser Antilles, St. John in the Virgin Islands, and Curacao and Aruba in the southern Caribbean. Two species of malaria were identified in 4859 lizards sampled from the 17 islands, Plasmodium floridense and P. azurophilum. There was no relationship between island size, elevation, or rainfall and the presence or absence of malaria. Some of the largest islands had no malaria, some large and small islands had one species, and some, including tiny Saba, had both species of Plasmodium. P. azurophilum was found throughout the Lesser Antilles from Se. Martin to Grenada; P. floridense was restricted to the northern islands, not further south than Montserrat. Our results, combined with surveys from other areas of the Caribbean basin, show both species of malaria infect anoles from distantly related taxonomic groups, suggesting that the parasites have had an ancient association with their lizard hosts.

AB Forest structure and the use of feeding and nest trees by Ratufa indica were assessed at a disturbed and an undisturbed riverine habitat in Bori Wildlife Sanctuary, central India. There were differences in the availability of large trees between the sites. However, despite these differences in forest structure, R. indica at both sites showed similar preferences for feeding in trees greater than 150 cm in girth at breast height (GBH) and with heights greater than 15 m. A preference for larger trees was also observed in the use of nest trees. Though the species may be able to adapt to disturbed forests, there is preferential use of tall mature trees and dependence on canopy continuity. The assessment of forest structure is essential in determining habitat suitability for giant squirrel.

AB Tree species, genus, and family richness (DBH greater than or equal to 10 cm) is recorded in 95 plots of 0.1 ha, situated in most physiographic units in the middle Caqueta area, east of Araracuara, in the Amazon lowlands of Colombia.
   A positive correlation is present between forest canopy height and tree species density. Highest tree taxon density is recorded in upland (non-flooded) plots with well-drained soils. Lowest tree taxon density is found in poorly drained swamps, while plots on podzolized (''white sand'') soils show intermediate levels. In well-drained flood plains tree taxon density is lower in comparison with well-drained uplands, but this difference becomes smaller when stem densities are taken into account. Patterns of cumulative numbers of tree taxa in series of plots combined are similar. The results suggest that general patterns of tree taxon richness are mostly related to habitat hostility and environmental stress factors.
   Fluvial dynamics, between plot soil heterogeneity and beta diversity, play only a subordinate role in the maintenance of the high tree species diversity in the well-drained uplands. Here, tree species density in Proportion to stem density is slightly higher in forests on the less nutrient poor, more clayey and reddish soils with thinner humus forms compared to forests on very poor, loamy, and yellowish soils with thicker humus forms. These results may be explained in terms of habitat hostility (stress) or forest dynamics. Gap phase dynamics could be important in maintaining high levels of tree species alpha diversity in well-drained upland forests. Extinction of tree species related to cyclic forest disappearances on a regional scale has probably been relatively unimportant.

   particle size; sand; soil
AB Measurements of driptips of understory plants in three different communities of the central Amazon-the ''campina'' (an open scrub) and the ''campinarana'' (a low foresc), both occurring on sandy soils, and the high forest occurring on a clay soil-revealed that driptips were significantly more evident in high forest than in the other two communities, which were not different from each other. As these communities are located in the same region and exposed to the same climate, selection for driptips may have been more intense on clay soils than on sandy soils because the former are more susceptible to erosion. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that driptips provide a natural mechanism to reduce soil erosion by decreasing the drop size of leaf runoff. Soils exhibiting different sensitivities to erosion would then be associated with the degree of driptip development in understory plants.

ID TROPICAL FOREST; CONSEQUENCES; PHENOLOGIES; REGULARITY; COMMUNITY
AB We studied the phenology of leaf production and loss, flowering, and fruiting on Henderson Island, a raised limestone island situated at 24 degrees S in the Central South Pacific. The one-year study encompassed 19 of the 22 wide-spread indigenous tree and shrub species found in the plateau forest. Of 11 species showing significant annual variation in leaf production, all grew most new leaves immediately after the solar zenith between January and March, when temperatures were highest. Thirteen species showed significant annual variation in leafless, with peaks in October/ November or January/February. In most species, January-June saw net leaf gain, while the converse was true from July-December. Only one species, Premna serratifolia, was deciduous, shedding leaves and then remaining leafless for approximately two months until new shoots grew leaves. Flowering and fruiting were more evenly distributed through the year than leaf production. This could be related to the scarcity of pollinating insects and/or of fruit dispersers on this exceptionally remote island.

AB The reproductive phenology of the entire climber community (96 species of lianas and 40 species of vines) in a semideciduous forest in Southeastern Brazil (22 degrees 49'45''S; 47 degrees 06'33''W and 670 m altitude) was observed from March 1988 to February 1991. Phenological observations were made weekly by walking along a 10.5 km trail in the interior and at the forest edges of the Santa Genebra Reserve (SGR). The most species-rich families of climbers were Bignoniaceae (22), Malpighiaceae (17), Sapindaceae (12) and Asteraceae (12). Flowering patterns for woody lianas and herbaceous vines differed. Lianas had two flowering peaks: a minor peak in March in the transition from wet to dry season, and a major peak in October during the transition from dry to wet season. The flowering peak for herbaceous vines was in April. Fruiting of lianas was highly seasonal, with one peak in the late dry season (July-August). Fruiting for vines was less seasonal with a slight peak in March. These differences were consistent with the predominance of wind-dispersed fruits among lianas (72% of species) versus vines (52%). Low rainfall, high leaf fall, and strong winds during the dry season favor wind dispersal. More species of vines (40%) have animal-dispersed seeds than lianas (19%), and most vines fruited during the wet season. Phenological patterns of climbers and trees and treelets at SGR differed. The life form of lianas and their system of reserve economy may allow them to reproduce during periods unfavorable to trees. Displacement of peak flowering periods of trees and climbers pollinated by bees and small generalist insects may decrease competition for pollen vectors among species of these two groups of plants. Whereas the fruiting patterns of wind-dispersed trees and climbers at SGR were similar (most species fruiting during the dry season), animal-dispersed trees and treelets fruited throughout the year while animal-dispersed climbers exhibited a pronounced peak in late wet season. The distinct phenological patterns of climbers, generally complementary to those presented by trees, resulted in constant availability of Bowers and fruits throughout the year and enhances the importance of this plant group in Neotropical forests.

AB The traditional milpa agriculture system (slash-burn) of the Lacandon Maya people in eastern Chiapas, Mexico has created and uses a variety of habitat patches including the whole range of seral stages during forest development. This study examines seed bank attributes in habitats associated with slash-burn agriculture and with the more recent expansion of grasslands. We estimated the abundance and floristic composition of seeds in the soil from induced grasslands, milpa fields neighboring early and mature forests, and from secondary forest and mature tropical rain forest (15 samples by site, 2-3 replicated sites per successional stage). A total of 130 species germinated from the soil samples. The seeds of late successional tree species were scarce in all the seed soil samples (<2% of che species). Twenty-five early successional species accounted for ca. 70 percent of all individuals. Soil seed density (but not species richness) increased as milpas and fallows dominated the landscape. Affinity analysis based on presence/absence and abundance data showed a different soil seed bank composition for the grasslands when compared to that of all other successional communities. Our results suggest that current expansion of pastures and agricultural fields modifies seed deposition and storage patterns in the soil that may alter the process of secondary succession. This compromises both the regenerating potential of tropical rain forest in the region, and the sustainability of traditional practices and economic relationships of the Lacandon Maya.

AB The effects of fire on growth of Palicourea rigida (Rubiaceae) were significant in a comparison between adjacent burned and unburned sites in cerrado savanna vegetation near Brasilia, Brazil. Many more small and young leaves appeared after the fire in the early part of the wet season, and leaves after che burn were much less tough for a given leaf length class than in che unburned area (unburned area leaves were 150% cougher). Growth of host plants after fire resulted in higher colonization of a leaf-galling midge in the genus Contarinia (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae) as yet unnamed at the species level. On the highest intensity of attack per leaf length class, galls were over five times more abundant per leaf in the burn than in the unburned area. Within the galls larvae survived better in the burned site, and numbers of surviving larvae at the end of the first generation were 5.4 times higher per leaf than in the unburned area. An even stronger effect of fire was observed in the second generation of gallers after the fire, when no living larvae could be found in the unburned area, but 17 living larvae per 100 leaves occurred in the burned site. These results supported che Plant Vigor Hypothesis, because regrowth after fire produced younger more tender leaves favorable for herbivore attack. The importance of fire in a landscape as a disturbance factor in cerrado, which rejuvenates plant growth, increasing favorability for many insect herbivores, deserves more attention and study.
