AB Making generalizations about the impact of commercial selective logging on biodiversity has so far remained elusive. Species responses to logging depend on a number of factors, many of which have not been studied in detail. These factors may include the natural forest conditions (forest types) under which logging impacts are investigated; but this question has so far remained unexamined. In a large-scale replicate study we aimed at clarifying the relationship between logging and forest types on leaf litter frogs. We contrast three distinct and naturally occurring forest types, including wet evergreen, moist evergreen and semi-deciduous forests. Selectively logged sites were compared with primary forest sites for each forest type. We found that the response of frog communities to logging varies in different forest types. In the wet evergreen forest, richness was higher in logged forest than primary forest, while diversity measures were not different between logged and primary forest habitats. In the moist evergreen, richness and diversity were higher in selectively logged areas compared with primary forest habitats. In the semi-deciduous, logged forests were characterized by drastic loss of forest specialists, reduced richness, and diversity. These results indicate that the net effect of logging varies with respect to forest type. Forest types that are characterized by adverse climatic conditions (i.e., low rainfall and protracted dry seasons) are more likely to produce negative effects on leaf litter anuran communities. For comparisons of the impact of logging on species to be effective, future research must endeavor to include details of forest type.

AB As the global demand for the reliable provision of virtually all ecosystem services increases, it is imperative to conduct experimental research that tests specific mechanisms or drivers of the ecological processes that link to services, and whether these management actions can affect biodiversity and processes synergistically. Agroforestry systems are ideal for such experiments due to their increased uniformity and the relative ease with which factors can be manipulated and isolated. Manipulating the availability of food resources, we carried out an experimental test of this potential driver on bird diversity measures and the predatory services provided by birds in coffee agroforests. We constructed exclosures over coffee plants to measure arthropod removal intensity by birds comparing coffee agroforests with and without food resource (fruit) enrichment (the driver). Fruit enrichment agroforests had significantly greater bird species density (50%), overall abundance (55%), and abundance of understory insectivore specialists (89%) compared with control agroforests. Although 48 percent more arthropods were aspirated from coffee plants inside exclosures compared to coffee plants outside exclosures, fruit resource enrichment did not influence predatory activity by birds in the agroforests. The results of this study highlight the difficulties associated with managing lands for ecosystem services in complex ecosystems-management actions aimed at increasing numbers of the organisms involved in the interactions of ecological processes is not always equivalent to managing for an increase in the process itself.

AB Unraveling the mechanisms facilitating species coexistence in communities is a central theme in ecology. Species-rich tropical mammal communities provide excellent settings to explore such mechanisms as they often harbor numerous congeneric species with close phylogenetic relationships. Explicit tests for the mechanisms that allow syntopic occurrence in these assemblages, however, is often hampered because of the difficulty in obtaining detailed ecological data on the organisms making up the community. Using stable nitrogen and carbon ratios of hair samples, we examine whether trophic niche differentiation and microhabitat segregation explain the coexistence of 21 small mammal species at a montane humid forest site in eastern Madagascar. Overall, the community was trophically diverse and covered wide isotopic space. This diversity was based on: (1) a multi-layered trophic community structure with mainly frugivorous-granivorous rodents (subfamily Nesomyinae) as primary consumers and insectivorous tenrecs (family Tenrecidae) as secondary and tertiary consumers; (2) trophic segregation of rodents and tenrecs with the latter occupying different microhabitats; and (3) a dense and regular packing of species in the community. The 12 locally occurring Microgale shrew tenrecs (subfamily Oryzorictinae) showed high trophic redundancy, but were maximally spaced from each other within the trophic space covered by the genus. Results of stable isotope analysis suggest that in combination the differentiation of microhabitats and trophic niches explain the coexistence of small mammals in this community. Congeneric species appeared to be under more intense competition compared with non-congeneric species and their coexistence can only partly be explained by trophic and microhabitat niche segregation.

AB Secondary forests that develop following land abandonment could compensate for the losses of diversity and structure that accompany deforestation of old-growth forests in tropical regions. Whether secondary forests can harbor similar species richness, density, and composition of old-growth forests for vascular epiphytes remains largely unknown for secondary forests older than 50 yr. We examined community structure (species richness, density, and species composition) of vascular epiphytes in older secondary forests between 35 and 115 yr after land abandonment and nearby old-growth forests to determine if the community structure of epiphytes in secondary forests approaches that of old-growth forests over time. The recovery of epiphyte species richness was rapid with 55-year-old forests containing 65 percent of old-growth epiphyte species richness. Secondary forest epiphyte communities were found to be statistically nested within secondary forests older in age and within old-growth forests. Similarity of epiphyte communities to old-growth forests increased to 75 percent, 115 yr after abandonment. This study suggests that secondary forests will likely recover old-growth epiphyte richness and composition given enough time. Epiphyte densities did not recover quickly with 55-year-old forests having 14 percent and 115-year-old forests having only 49 percent of the density of old-growth forest epiphytes. The low density of epiphytes in secondary forests could impact rainforest diversity and function. We conclude that in less than 115 yr, although secondary moist forests have high conservation value for some aspects of community structure, they are unlikely to compensate biologically for the loss of diversity and ecosystem function that high epiphyte densities provide.

AB Mutualisms between invasive ants and honeydew-producing insects can have widespread negative effects on natural ecosystems. This is becoming an increasingly serious problem worldwide, causing certain ecosystems to change radically. Management of these abundant and influential mutualistic species is essential if the host ecosystem is to recover to its former non-invaded status. This negative effect is particularly prevalent on some tropical islands, including Cousine Island, Seychelles. On this island, the invasive ant Pheidole megacephala has caused serious indirect damage to the threatened native Pisonia grandis trees via a mutualism with an invasive scale insect, Pulvinaria urbicola. We aimed to suppress the ant, thereby decoupling the mutualism and enabling recovery of the Pisonia trees. We treated all areas where ant pressure was high with a selective formicidal bait, which was deployed in custom-made bait stations designed to avoid risk of treatment to endemic fauna. In the treated area, ant foraging activity was reduced by 93 percent and was followed by a 100 percent reduction in scale insect density. Abundance of endemic herbivorous insects and herbivorous activity increased significantly, however, after the decline in mutualistic species densities. Despite the native herbivore increase, there was considerable overall improvement in Pisonia shoot condition and an observed increase in foliage density. Our results demonstrate the benefit of strategic management of highly mutualistic alien species to the native Pisonia trees. It also supports the idea that area-wide suppression is a feasible alternative to eradication for achieving positive conservation management at the level of the forest ecosystem.

AB Tropical secondary forests form an important part of the landscape. Understanding functional traits of species that colonize at different points in succession can provide insight into community assembly. Although studies on functional traits during forest succession have focused on trees, lianas (woody vines) also contribute strongly to forest biomass, species richness, and dynamics. We examined life history traits of lianas in a forest chronosequence in Costa Rica to determine which traits vary consistently over succession. We conducted 0.1 ha vegetation inventories in 30 sites. To examine the establishment of young individuals, we only included small lianas (0.51.5 cm diameter at 1.3 m height). For each species, we identified seed size, dispersal mode, climbing mode, and whether or not the seedling is self-supporting. We found a strong axis of variation determined by seed size and seedling growth habit, with early successional communities dominated by small-seeded species with abiotic dispersal and climbing seedlings, while large-seeded, animal-dispersed species with free-standing seedlings increased in abundance with stand age. Contrary to previous research and theory, we found a decrease in the abundance of stem twiners and no decrease in the abundance of tendril-climbers during succession. Seed size appears to be a better indicator of liana successional stage than climbing mode. Liana life history traits change predictably over succession, particularly traits related to seedling establishment. Identifying whether these trait differences persist into the growth strategies of mature lianas is an important research goal, with potential ramifications for understanding the impact of lianas during tropical forest succession.

AB Drip-tips are a common feature of the leaves of rain forest trees, but their functional significance remains contested. The most widely accepted hypothesis is that drip-tips assist drainage of the lamina thereby aiding drying of the leaf surface and reducing the rate of colonization and abundance of epiphyllic organisms. The drying action of drip-tips may also enhance transpiration and reduce the need for investment in support structures. Furthermore, drip-tips may help prevent splash erosion around the base of the tree. Data from 130 forest Amazonian plots are used to investigate the abundance and distribution of drip-tips and, through regression methods that incorporate spatial autocorrelation, seek to identify associations between the frequency of drip-tips and a range of climatic variables. The average frequency of species and trees with drip-tips across all plots was 32 and 33 percent, respectively. Trees and species with drip-tips were significantly more prevalent in the Central-East Amazon than the other regions. Drip-tips were also associated with tree species that have smaller maximum heights and with trees with smaller trunk diameters. The proportion of species and individuals with drip-tips was more strongly correlated with precipitation of the wettest trimester than with total annual precipitation or length of the dry season. Our results extend and provide support for both existing hypotheses for the functional benefit of possessing a drip-tip. Moreover, the currently unrecognized macrogeographic association between the frequency of drip-tips in trees of the tropical forest understory and areas of heavy precipitation suggests a new function for this trait.

AB While fleshy-fruited invasive alien plants are recognized as some of the worst invaders on a global scale, until recently, little consideration has been given to the frugivores that feed on these fruits and, more specifically, the fruit traits, which may influence this. We investigated a series of morphological and nutritive fruit traits for ca 30 species of fleshy-fruited invasive alien and exotic species in South Africa. Invasive alien fruit traits were compared with comparable traits of a similar sample size of indigenous fleshy fruits, which occur in the same area. Finally, the similarity of traits for the same invasive alien species was compared with those fruits in Australia. Invasive alien fleshy fruits were similar in morphology, but greater in some nutritive aspects when compared with indigenous fruits. Furthermore, they were very similar in all aspects to their counterparts in Australia. Most seeds of invasive fleshy fruits were small and light, which may explain some of their invasive success, as benefits associated with small seededness may promote invasive potential. Nutritionally, most invasive alien fleshy-fruits were hexose-dominant, containing low lipid and nitrogen content. While frugivore preference trends remain to be formally investigated, this study provides insights into fruit traits, which may tentatively outline why invasive fruits are universally fed on and thus successfully spread.

AB Indigenous woody species are important natural resources in West African savannas. Information about their population structures and response to human impact, particularly land use, however, is scarce. In this study, we explored (1) the effect of land use on the population structure of woody savanna species; and (2) searched for species with similar population structures related to comparable ecological preferences. Using generalized linear models, we separately analyzed the size-class distribution (SCD) of 30 species to reveal the influence of three land cover types (non-arable land, fallows, and protected areas) on population structures. Generalized linear models were applied to identify comparable population structures of species with similar ecological preferences. We were able to identify five groups for shrub species and four groups for tree species with different population structures and comparable ecological preferences. In terms of human impact, we detected four groups of species responding similarly to land use. Especially for trees, we found a strong influence of local land use on SCD and hence, population structures. The SCD of shrub species tends to be more related to species' ecological preferences. Some of the shrub species may be characterized as ubiquitous species as their SCD is neither related to land use nor ecological preferences, indicating a high tolerance to disturbance. The observed results have implications on local woody species composition in relation to land use. According to this, we propose focusing on trees when developing appropriate local land use management strategies.

AB Establishing which factors determine species distributions is of major relevance for practical applications such as conservation planning. The Amazonian lowlands exhibit considerable internal heterogeneity that is not apparent in existing vegetation maps. We used ferns as a model group to study patterns in plant species distributions and community composition at regional and landscape scales. Fern species composition and environmental data were collected in 109 plots of 250 x 2 m distributed among four sites in Brazilian Amazonia. Interplot distances varied from 1 to ca 670 km. When floristically heterogeneous datasets were analyzed, the use of an extended Sorensen dissimilarity index rather than the traditional Sorensen index improved model fit and made interpretation of the results easier. Major factors associated with species composition varied among sites, difference in cation concentration was a strong predictor of floristic dissimilarity in those sites with pronounced heterogeneity in cation concentration. Difference in clay content was the most relevant variable in sites with uniform cation concentrations. In every case, environmental differences were invariably better than geographic distances in predicting species compositional differences. Our results are consistent with the ideas that: (1) the relative predictive capacity of the explanatory variables depend on the relative lengths of the observed gradients; and (2) environmental gradients can be hierarchically structured such that gradients occur inside gradients. Therefore, site-specific relationships among variables can mask the bigger picture and make it more difficult to unravel the factors structuring plant communities in Amazonia.

AB The introduced tree species Spathodea campanulata (Bignoniaceae) forms novel forests in Puerto Rico, these having emerged after the abandonment of fields in the mid-20th century and resulting in forests with a new species composition. We assessed bryophyte species richness in these novel forests and sought correlations with geological substrate, past land use, forest edge and patch area, forest structure, elevation, microhabitat diversity, tree species richness, and microclimatic conditions. Transects were established (edge and forest interior) in nine moist forest patches dominated by Spathodea in north-central Puerto Rico. These Spathodea forest patches ranged from 0.6 to 9 ha. ANOVA, Chi-square, correlation, and cluster analyses were used in data analyses. We found 57 bryophyte species. There was a significant difference in bryophyte richness among patches. Those on karst exhibited highest bryophyte richness due to microhabitat diversity, past land use, and shorter hydroperiods. Alluvial sites scored lowest in bryophyte species richness, and forest structure was important for bryophyte communities on these sites. Significant differences in temperature, relative humidity, and light intensity were observed between edge and forest interior. These appeared important for establishing bryophyte species cover but not richness and composition. Microhabitat diversity, patch area, and forest age were more related to bryophyte species richness than elevation, exposed edge, and tree species richness, regardless of geologic substrate. Collectively, Spathodea patches were similar to mature forests on the Island with respect to bryophyte species richness and composition. Novel Spathodea forests have conservation value due to their habitat suitability for bryophyte communities.

AB Although tropical forests have been rapidly converted into human-modified landscapes, tree species response to forest edges remains poorly examined. In this study, we addressed four pioneer tree species to document demographic shifts experienced by this key ecological group and make inferences about pioneer response to forest edges. All individuals with dbh = 1 cm of two short-lived (Bellucia grossularioides and Cecropia sciadophylla) and two long-lived species (Goupia glabra and Laetia procera) were sampled in 20 1-ha forest edge plots and 20 1-ha forest interior plots in Oiapoque and Manaus, Northeast and Central Amazon, respectively. As expected, pioneer stem density with dbh = 1 cm increased by around 1017-fold along forest edges regardless of species, lifespan, and study site. Edge populations of long-lived pioneers presented 8494 percent of their individuals in sapling/subadult size classes, whereas edge populations of short-lived pioneers showed 5697 percent of their individuals in adult size classes. These demographic biases were associated with negative and positive net adult recruitment of long- and short-lived pioneers, respectively. Our population-level analyses support three general statements: (1) native pioneer tree species proliferate along forest edges (i.e., increased density), at least in terms of non-reproductive individuals; (2) pioneer response to edge establishment is not homogeneous as species differ in terms of demographic structure and net adult recruitment; and (3) some pioneer species, particularly long-lived ones, may experience population decline due to adult sensitivity to edge-affected habitats.

AB The emerging infectious disease chytridiomycosis, caused by the amphibian chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), is implicated in widespread population declines, extirpations, and extinctions of amphibians throughout the world. In the Neotropics, most amphibian declines have occurred in cool mid- to high-elevation sites (> 400 m asl), and it is hypothesized that high temperatures limit the growth of Bd in lowland tropical sites, despite few data available on the distribution of Bd in lowland forests. Here, we report the results of a 12-mo pathogen surveillance program for three common species of frogs at a warm lowland site in northeastern Costa Rica. We combine standard non-invasive skin swabbing techniques with a quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay to analyze the infection prevalence and Bd load across a 1-yr period. Our data indicate an overall Bd infection rate of 6.1 percent, but prevalence varies from < 5 percent in warmer months to a peak of 34.7 percent in the coolest months of the year. Despite very little seasonal variation in temperature (< 4 degrees C), our data indicate strong seasonal variation in the prevalence of Bd, with highest prevalence of infection in months with coolest air temperatures. While it has been suggested that Bd is primarily a riparian fungus, we find no difference in prevalence of infection among our species despite considerable differences in affiliation of these species with water. Our study provides further evidence that infection by Bd is regulated by temperature and shows that warm temperatures in lowland forests may restrict, but not prevent, infection by Bd.

AB Most megadiversity regions lack basic wild animal diversity information such as species lists. This absence of basic knowledge restricts the development and effectiveness of conservation action plans, which are urgently needed for animal groups such as amphibians, the most threatened vertebrate group in the world. In this study, we estimated Brazilian anuran diversity based on species range distribution shapes and evaluated factors that likely affect species lists, such as current taxonomy knowledge, current number of specimens collected in each region, biome characteristics, and anuran size (snoutvent length). We were able to demonstrate differences among the distributional patterns of species within each biome and each Brazilian federative state and among certain factors that influence their diversity, such as latitudinal variation. In this integrative study, we provide zoogeographic information about the richest (in terms of anuran biodiversity) country in the world (at least 849 described species, about 60% of which are endemic), which may be fundamental to future conservation actions in Brazil.

AB Predators significantly affect ecosystem functions, but our understanding of to what extent findings can be transferred from experiments and low-diversity systems to highly diverse, natural ecosystems is limited. With a particular threat of biodiversity loss at higher trophic levels, however, knowledge of spatial and temporal patterns in predator assemblages and their interrelations with lower trophic levels is essential for assessing effects of trophic interactions and advancing biodiversity conservation in these ecosystems. We analyzed spatial and temporal variability of spider assemblages in tree species-rich subtropical forests in China, across 27 study plots varying in woody plant diversity and stand age. Despite effects of woody plant richness on spider assemblage structure, neither habitat specificity nor temporal variability of spider richness and abundance were influenced. Rather, variability increased with forest age, probably related to successional changes in spider assemblages. Our results indicate that woody plant richness and theory predicting increasing predator diversity with increasing plant diversity do not necessarily play a major role for spatial and temporal dynamics of predator assemblages in such plant species-rich forests. Diversity effects on biotic or abiotic habitat conditions might be less pronounced across our gradient from medium to high plant diversity than in previously studied less diverse systems, and bottom-up effects might level out at high plant diversity. Instead, our study highlights the importance of overall (diversity-independent) environmental heterogeneity in shaping spider assemblages and, as indicated by a high species turnover between plots, as a crucial factor for biodiversity conservation at a regional scale in these subtropical forests.

AB Tropical ecosystems are globally important for bird diversity. In many tropical regions, land-use intensification has caused conversion of natural forests into human-modified habitats, such as secondary forests and heterogeneous agricultural landscapes. Despite previous research, the distribution of bird communities in these forest-farmland mosaics is not well understood. To achieve a comprehensive understanding of bird diversity and community turnover in a human-modified Kenyan landscape, we recorded bird communities at 20 sites covering the complete habitat gradient from forest (near natural forest, secondary forest) to farmland (subsistence farmland, sugarcane plantation) using point counts and distance sampling. Bird density and species richness were on average higher in farmland than in forest habitats. Within forest and farmland, bird density and species richness increased with vegetation structural diversity, i.e., were higher in near natural than in secondary forest and in subsistence farmland than in sugarcane plantations. Bird communities in forest and farmland habitats were very distinct and very few forest specialists occurred in farmland habitats. Moreover, insectivorous bird species declined in farmland habitats whereas carnivores and herbivores increased. Our study confirms that tropical farmlands can hardly accommodate forest specialist species. Contrary to most previous studies, our findings show that structurally rich tropical farmlands hold a surprisingly rich and distinct bird community that is threatened by conversion of subsistence farmland into sugarcane plantations. We conclude that conservation strategies in the tropics must go beyond rain forest protection and should integrate structurally heterogeneous agroecosystems into conservation plans that aim at maintaining the diverse bird communities of tropical forest-farmland mosaics.

AB Clouded Leopard, Leopard, and Tiger are threatened felids in Southeast Asia, but little is known about the factors influencing their distributions. Using logistic regression, we assessed how habitat variables, prey detection patterns, and presence of intraguild predators affect the occurrence of these felids across 13 protected areas within Thailand. Our analysis is based on data from 1108 camera-trap locations (47,613 trap-nights). Clouded Leopard and Leopard are associated with habitat where Red Muntjac and Eurasian Wild Pig were most likely to be present. Tiger are associated with habitat with a higher likelihood for the presence of Gaur, Eurasian Wild Pig, and Sambar. Clouded Leopard and Tiger were both weakly associated with areas with mature evergreen forest. Besides availability of prey, associations with potential competitors also appear to influence the distribution of these felids, although the strength of these effects requires further investigation. Occurrence rates for Clouded Leopard were no different in protected areas with Leopard versus without Leopards. Leopard had similar occurrence rates regardless of the presence of Tiger, but Leopards were less likely to be detected at the same camera-trap points with the larger felid. Our results suggest that the two most commonly photographed prey species in the study areas serve as key prey species, Eurasian Wild Pig for all three carnivores and Red Muntjac for Leopard and Clouded Leopard.

AB The forest-like characteristics of agroforestry systems create a unique opportunity to combine agricultural production with biodiversity conservation in human-modified tropical landscapes. The cacao-growing region in southern Bahia, Brazil, encompasses Atlantic forest remnants and large extensions of agroforests, locally known as cabrucas, and harbors several endemic large mammals. Based on the differences between cabrucas and forests, we hypothesized that: (1) non-native and non-arboreal mammals are more frequent, whereas exclusively arboreal and hunted mammals are less frequent in cabrucas than forests; (2) the two systems differ in mammal assemblage structure, but not in species richness; and (3) mammal assemblage structure is more variable among cabrucas than forests. We used camera-traps to sample mammals in nine pairs of cabruca-forest sites. The high conservation value of agroforests was supported by the presence of species of conservation concern in cabrucas, and similar species richness and composition between forests and cabrucas. Arboreal species were less frequently recorded, however, and a non-native and a terrestrial species adapted to open environments (Cerdocyon thous) were more frequently recorded in cabrucas. Factors that may overestimate the conservation value of cabrucas are: the high proportion of total forest cover in the study landscape, the impoverishment of large mammal fauna in forest, and uncertainty about the long-term maintenance of agroforestry systems. Our results highlight the importance of agroforests and forest remnants for providing connectivity in human-modified tropical forest landscapes, and the importance of controlling hunting and dogs to increase the value of agroforestry mosaics.

AB As protected areas become more accessible via transportation networks, fragmentation, and encroachment from the borders, carnivores in these areas frequently decline. To counter these pressures, patrolling and active wildlife enforcement are widely accepted as fundamental conservation strategies. Using the case example of Khao Yai National Park (KYNP) and data from a camera trap survey, we modeled and evaluated the effectiveness of ranger stations in reducing human access and illegal activities, and in increasing prey and predator presence. This type of data and analysis is needed to monitor and evaluate enforcement effectiveness and develop adaptive management strategies. At KYNP, we used camera-trapping data as a proxy to evaluate whether or not a positive impact of ranger stations on wildlife distribution could outweigh edge effects from human disturbance. We assessed factors affecting the distribution of poachers and wildlife using Maxent. Our analysis was based on 217 camera trap locations (6260 trap nights) and suggests that ungulates and poachers persist nearby ranger stations. Rangers should increase patrolling efforts of border areas; however, increasing wildlife patrolling in inaccessible areas with mobile range units may be more effective than establishing more ranger stations along park boundaries.

AB Large areas of the Rio Negro basin in Amazonia are covered by continuous tracts of tropical forest, but have few primate species. This is anomalous considering the general relationship between area and number of species. One possibility is that much of the forest is unsuitable habitat for most primates and the area of suitable habitat is much less than the forested area. This has important consequences for the design of reserves and predictions of the consequences of climate change, which tend to be based on broad categories based on satellite images, and not on information of species distributions within those broad categories. The study was conducted through diurnal and nocturnal line-transect surveys in the Biodiversity Research Program 25-km2 permanent grid in Virua National Park, which has vegetation associations typical of much of northern Amazonia. The highest primate diversity and abundances occurred in tall terra firme forests (58%), whereas inundated forests and scrublands, which cover 42 percent of the survey grid and 90.8 percent of the Virua National Park, have virtually no primates. This suggests that parks and reserves in northwestern Amazonia will have to be very large to maintain viable populations of most primates and their ecological interactions, and that very broad habitat categories are not sufficient to make predictions about actual and future suitability of areas for primate conservation.

AB Pericopsis elata (Fabaceae) is a tall tree of high commercial value of the moist semi-deciduous African forests. As a result of decades of logging it is now considered as threatened and listed on the IUCN Red List and CITES Appendix II, even though essential biological parameters controlling its population dynamics remain unknown. This study aims at improving the knowledge of the species' ecological parameters, and at assessing the impact of selective logging on its populations in an 118,052 ha forest in Cameroon. After inventorying the species in 1432 ha, mortality and growth were assessed over continuous 5- and 2-yr periods in unlogged and logged areas, respectively. Phenology was monitored in the unlogged forest during 5 yr. The population structure shows high relative abundance of trees in medium size categories. Mean annual diameter increments in both environments did not differ significantly between unlogged and logged areas. P. elata is a deciduous species that flowers at the end of the main dry season. The minimum reproduction and effective flowering diameters were 32 and 37 cm, respectively. Fruit maturation took place during 7 mo. With a minimum logging diameter of 90 cm, the recovery rate computed over a 30-yr period was > 100 percent. Selective logging harvested only 12.1 percent of the total number of seed trees and had little influence on the species' biological parameters. Securing sufficient regeneration as a post-logging action is probably the most important consideration for achieving long-term sustainability.

AB The dipterocarps are dominant trees across a large part of lowland Southeast Asia. These forests provide a valuable timber resource, are rich in biodiversity, and are among the most important terrestrial carbon sinks in the world. Yet, these forests are fast disappearing, often unsustainably managed and are rapidly being replaced by agricultural crops such as oil palm and other commercial plantations. Here, we provide a brief overview to this family, outline its significance, and introduce the articles of this Special Section which provides a collection of the recent advances in our understanding of the biology of this important family of tropical trees.

AB We assessed the variability of chloroplast DNA sequences in populations of the dipterocarp forest tree, Shorea curtisii. This species is widely distributed in hill and coastal hill dipterocarp forests of the Malay Peninsula, whereas isolated populations are found in the coastal hills of north Borneo. Two chloroplast DNA regions (1555 similar to bp of trnH-psbA-trnK and 925 similar to bp of trnL-trnF) were sequenced from 123 individuals collected from six Malay Peninsula and two Bornean populations. There were 15 chloroplast haplotypes derived from 16 polymorphic sites. A haplotype network revealed two distinct haplogroups that correlate with two geographic regions, the Malay Peninsula and Borneo. These two haplogroups differed by a number of mutations, and no haplotypes were shared between populations from the different geographic regions. This suggests an ancient diversification of these haplogroups, and that long-distance seed dispersal was unlikely to have occurred during the Pleistocene when the Sunda Shelf was a contiguous landmass. Phylogenetic analysis of the haplotypes together with those found in other Shorea species showed that two haplogroups in S. curtisii appear in different positions of the phylogenetic tree. This could be explained by the persistence of ancestral polymorphisms or by ancient chloroplast capture. Low levels of genetic differentiation were found between populations within each geographic region. Signature of a bottleneck followed by demographic expansion was detected in the Malay Peninsula haplogroup. The presence of two distinct evolutionary lineages in the different regions suggests that they should be managed independently to conserve the major sources of genetic diversity in S. curtisii.

AB Fine-scale spatial genetic structure is increasingly recognized as an important factor in the studies of tropical forest trees as it influences genetic diversity of local populations. The biologic mechanisms that generate fine-scale spatial genetic structure are not fully understood. We studied fine-scale spatial genetic structure in ten coexisting dipterocarp tree species in a Bornean rain forest using microsatellite markers. Six of the ten species showed statistically significant fine-scale spatial genetic structure. Fine-scale spatial genetic structure was stronger at smaller spatial scales (=similar to 100 similar to m) than at larger spatial scales (>similar to 100 similar to m) for each species. Multiple regression analysis suggested that seed dispersal distance was important at the smaller spatial scale. At the larger scale (>similar to 100 similar to m) and over the entire sample range (01000 similar to m), pollinators and spatial distribution of adult trees were more important determinants of fine-scale spatial genetic structure. Fine-scale spatial genetic structure was stronger in species pollinated by less mobile small beetles than in species pollinated by the more mobile giant honeybee (Apis dorsata). It was also stronger in species where adult tree distributions were more clumped. The hypothesized mechanisms underlying the negative correlation between clump size and fine-scale spatial genetic structure were a large overlap among seed shadows and genetic drift within clumped species.

AB Plant habitat associations are well documented in Bornean lowland tropical forests, but few studies contrast the prevalence of associations across sites. We examined habitat associations and community composition of Dipterocarpaceae trees in two contrasting Bornean lowland mixed dipterocarp forests separated by approximately 100 similar to km: Andulau (uniform topography, lower altitudinal range, sandy soils) and Belalong (highly dissected topography, higher altitudinal range, clay-rich soils). Dipterocarpaceae trees =similar to 1 similar to cm diameter at breast height (dbh) were censused in 20-m wide belt transects established along topographic gradients at each site. Dipterocarp density, evenness, species richness, and diversity were significantly higher at Andulau than Belalong. Significant site associations (with either Andulau or Belalong) were detected for 19 (52%) of the 37 dipterocarp species tested. Dipterocarpaceae community composition at Belalong correlated with soil nutrient concentrations as well as measures of vegetation and topographic structure, but community composition at Andulau correlated with fewer habitat variables. Within each site, dipterocarp density, species richness, and diversity were consistently higher on ridges than in slopes and valleys. Significant within-site associations to topographic habitats were less common at Andulau (10% of species tested) than at Belalong (15%). We conclude that edaphic and other environmental factors influence dipterocarp community composition at a local scale, and are more important drivers of community structure in the more variable environment at Belalong. Species richness and diversity of dipterocarps on small plots, however, were higher at Andulau, suggesting that factors other than environmental heterogeneity contribute to contrasts in dipterocarp tree species richness at small scales.

AB The effects of El Nino-induced droughts on dipterocarp forests must be quantified to evaluate the implications of future global climatic changes for the tropical forests of Southeast Asia. We studied the mortality of trees =1cm in diameter in a lowland dipterocarp forest in Borneo before, during, and after the 1997/1998 El Nino drought. The annual mortality rates were 1.30, 1.75, and 1.66percent/yr for the pre-drought, drought, and post-drought periods, respectively. The effect of drought was tree size-dependent being greater for larger trees. Modified logistic regression analysis revealed a significant interaction effect between species' habitat association and edaphic condition on mortality rates in all periods. For species associated with wet habitat, drought effect was greater in dry conditions than in wet conditions, in both the drought and post-drought periods. The mortality rates of dry-habitat species were less affected by the drought both in dry and wet conditions. A similar pattern was also found in common Dipterocarpaceae species; mortality rates increased more in species associated with wet-habitat in the drought and post-drought periods. Species and families with higher mortality in the pre-drought period tended to experience greater mortality increases during the drought and post-drought periods. These results suggest that changes in drought regimes alter the species composition and spatial distribution of dipterocarp forests.

AB Continuous leaf phenology, with sequential production of metamers, is usually found in pioneer species, but is rare in shade-tolerant species. Because of the nature of continuous growth, continuous phenology has seldom been related to meteorological factors. We studied the leaf demography of seedlings and tall trees of a shade-tolerant emergent species, Dipterocarpus sublamellatus (Dipterocarpaceae), in Malaysia. Although leaf phenology of D. sublamellatus was classified as continuous, the rates of leaf production and leaf fall were not constant and greatly fluctuated during the census period. Seasonal patterns of leaf production and fall were not synchronized across tall trees in most combinations or between seedlings and tall trees. Mean number of leaves produced per month and its seasonal fluctuation were greater in tall trees than in seedlings. Moreover, relationships between leaf phenology and meteorological factors (monthly rainfall, net radiation, maximum and minimum temperature, and minimum relative humidity) differed among trees. This suggests that endogenous rhythms, i.e., differences in allocation of resources to growth and storage among trees, are important to fluctuations in leaf phenology. These patterns are in contrast to patterns found in various pioneer species with continuous phenology, in which rates of leaf production and fall are generally constant. Different patterns might be caused by differences in allocation to growth and storage between pioneer and shade-tolerant species, and might be related to their regeneration strategies.

AB A continuing challenge in tropical ecology is to explain the coexistence of large numbers of rain forest tree species. One possible coexistence mechanism is partitioning of the highly variable and dynamic forest light environment, in which species that grow better in one light treatment grow worse in another. To test whether species respond differently to the light environment, we estimated growth rates of 21 Dipterocarpaceae species from Malaysian Borneo grown in shade houses for 2 similar to yr in three light treatments (0.3%, 3%, and 18% full sunlight). We made regular measurements of height, diameter, and aboveground biomass, enabling us to calculate growth rates for each response. We estimated size-specific growth rates using nonlinear mixed-effects models, as average relative growth rate was strongly size dependent. For all species, the greatest diameter growth rate was achieved in 18 percent full sunlight, whereas for five of the twenty-one species, the greatest height growth rate was achieved in three percent full sunlight. We investigated correlations among growth rates in different light treatments, but no negative correlations were found, indicating that species growing well in one light treatment did not grow poorly in the others. There were substantial crossovers, however, in species ranks among the three light treatments, indicating that there was no single growth rate hierarchy common to all light treatments. The lack of a single consistent growth hierarchy across light treatments indicates that heterogeneity in the forest light environment could contribute to the maintenance of the diversity of Dipterocarpaceae found in lowland Bornean rain forests via light-based regeneration niches.

AB Dipterocarps are one of the most important tree families in the lowland forests of Southeast Asia and are somewhat unusual among tropical trees in that they form ectomycorrhizal (EcM) symbiotic root-inhabiting fungal associations. It has been hypothesized that dipterocarps have been partnered in this mutualistic association prior to the separation of Gondwana. Under many conditions EcMs form rapidly on dipterocarp seedlings through inocula present in the soil, although few studies have been conducted to provide evidence that they improve seedling establishment and performance. There are hundreds of EcM species associated with dipterocarps. Fungal fruit body surveys suggest that the most important families are Amanitaceae, Boletaceae, and Russulaceae, although Thelephoraceae also become numerically important when root tips are examined. EcM communities are affected by various biotic and abiotic factors, as well as anthropogenic perturbations, and the importance of these in structuring EcM communities is examined herein.

AB Borneo has experienced a rapid decline in the extent of forest cover, which has reduced the amount of habitat available for many plant and animal species. The precise impact of habitat loss on the conservation status of dipterocarp trees is uncertain. We use three contrasting techniques, the extent of occurrence, area of occupancy and ecological niche models derived using maxent, in conjunction with a current land-use map of Sabah, to derive estimates of habitat loss and infer a regional IUCN Red List conservation status for 33 Sabah dipterocarp species. Estimates of habitat loss differed significantly according to the methods employed and between species on different habitat types. Proportion of habitat loss determined from the ecological niche models varied from 21 percent for Shorea micans to 99.5 percent for Dipterocarpus lamellatus. Thirty-two of the 33 dipterocarp species analyzed in this study would have their Sabah populations classified as Threatened (equal to a habitat loss of >similar to 30%) under the A2 IUCN Red List criterion. Dipterocarps that occur in lowland forests have experienced greater habitat loss than upland/lower montane or ultramafic species. In addition, species with the lowest predicted area within their historic distributions had the highest proportion of habitat lost, which provides a rationale for targeting conservation effort on the species with narrow distributions. We recommend the ecological niche modeling approach as a rapid assessment tool for reconstructing species historic distributions during conservation assessments of tropical trees.

In this article, we synthesize the contributions to our understanding of the population genetics, ecology, and conservation of the family presented in this Special Section, and discuss their implications for mechanisms of dipterocarp species coexistence in natural and disturbed forests. We highlight the need for research to address how the processes that give rise to dipterocarp diversity are maintained in landscapes modified by anthropogenic activity.

AB We assessed the effects of deforestation on soil carbon (C) and nutrient stocks in the premontane landscape near Las Cruces Biological Station in southern Costa Rica, where forests were cleared for pasture in the mid-1960s. We excavated six soil pits to a depth of 1 similar to m in both pasture and primary forest, and found that C stocks were similar to 20 similar to kg similar to C/m2 in both settings. Nevertheless, soil d13C suggests similar to 50 percent of the forest-derived soil C above 40 similar to cm depth has turned over since deforestation. Soil nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) stocks derived from the soil pits were not significantly different between land uses (P similar to=similar to 0.43 and 0.61, respectively). At a larger spatial scale, however, the ubiquity of ruts produced by cattle-induced erosion indicates that there are substantial soil effects of grazing in this steep landscape. Ruts averaged 13 similar to cm deep and covered similar to 45 percent of the landscape, and thus are evidence of the removal of 0.7 similar to Mg similar to C/ha/yr, and 70, 9 and 40 similar to kg/ha/yr of N, P and potassium (K), respectively. Subsoils in this region are similar to 10 times less C- and N-rich, and similar to 2 times less P- and K-rich than the topsoil. Thus, rapid topsoil loss may lead to a decline in pasture productivity in the coming decades. These data also suggest that the soil C footprint of deforestation in this landscape may be determined by the fate of soil C as it is transported downstream, rather than C turnover in situ.

AB To compare community assemblage patterns in tropical northeastern and subtropical central eastern Australia across selected gradients and scales, we tested the relationship of species traits with phylogenetic structure, and niche breadth. We considered phylogenetic relationships across current-day species in assemblages in relation to rain forest species pool sizes, and trait values along gradients including elevation and latitude. Trait values were quantified across scales for seed size, leaf area, wood density and maximum height at maturity for 1137 species and 596 assemblages using trait gradient analysis (TGA). Local assemblages of subtropical species had narrower trait ranges, and higher niche breadth values than corresponding assemblages of tropical species. Leaf size and seed size increased at low latitudes, and community phylogenetic structure was most strongly correlated with seed traits in the subtropics, reflecting dispersal and re-colonization processes. Elevation accounted for little of the variance in community phylogenetic structure or trait variation across local and regional scales. Stable moist forest areas retained many species from ancestral rain forest lineages across a range of temporally conserved habitats; species within assemblages were less related; and rain forest assemblages had higher functional diversity, but lower niche breadth. This suggests that on average, assemblages of species in stable areas had greater trait variation and narrower distributions. Historic and recent rain forest contraction and re-expansion can result in recolonized areas that are dominated by species that are more related (phylogenetically) than by chance, have smaller, widely dispersed seeds, and greater niche breadth (broader distributions).

AB Density dependent processes are known to influence reproduction and establishment of plant populations. In this study, we evaluated the effects of local density and sexual expression on the reproductive success of the rare palm species Geonoma epetiolata in Costa Rica. We classified individuals in two density categories based on distances to the two nearest neighbors and recorded the occurrence of sexual overlap on each individual. Overlap between pistillate and staminate flowers in monoecious plants allows geitonogamous pollination, potentially reducing dependence on mates for reproduction. We measured plant size and light availability, and evaluated the influence of these variables on pollination success, fruit production, fruit abortion and seed mass. Pollination success significantly increased with density but there was no effect of sexual overlap. In contrast, there was no effect of density on the probability of initiated fruit, and a negative effect on fruit set. Fruit abortion was lowest in isolated plants with no sexual overlap. Plant size and light did not contribute to variation in reproductive success. In conclusion, the pollination advantage of plants in dense neighborhoods does not compensate reproductive losses incurred by fruit abortion, possibly due to mating among genetically related individuals. Geonoma epetiolata is threatened by habitat loss and poaching of seeds for the horticultural market. High fruit abortion rates associated with density in G. epetiolata suggest that seed collections from the remnant wild populations of this palm species may cause bottlenecks that further threaten population viability.

AB Frugivores exhibit considerable variation in the seed dispersal services they provide. Understanding what drives these differences is a key goal for ecologists because of the central role seed dispersal plays in shaping ecological and genetic diversity in plant populations. The lek-mating system of the Long-wattled Umbrellabird (Cephalopterus penduliger) provides a powerful lens to examine how mating behavior may impact seed dispersal outcomes. As in all lek-breeding species, male Umbrellabirds congregate in traditional sites (leks) to display, whereas females are solitary and visit leks only rarely. This study demonstrates how differences in mating behavior between the sexes drive distinctive seed movement and deposition patterns by male vs. female Umbrellabirds. Using radio tracking and gut retention trials, we documented divergent movement patterns between the sexes that are directly attributable to mating behavior differences. These movement differences led males to disperse seeds long distances from source trees and to deposit the majority of seeds they ingested within the lek; females dispersed seeds shorter distances and more evenly across the landscape. We empirically confirmed that the density of dispersed seeds was higher in leks than in control areas outside the lek, yet found no evidence that this higher density of seeds in leks reduced probability of seedling establishment. This research not only provides a mechanistic explanation for long dispersal distances and high levels of genetic diversity previously reported for seeds in Umbrellabird leks, but also highlights the importance of explicitly considering behavior in studies of animal-mediated seed dispersal.

AB Successful regeneration of bamboos from seed is a key issue in the ecology of many tropical regions and the livelihoods of their inhabitants. The gregarious monocarpy of many bamboos may be driven by a need to satiate seed predators by seeding in abundance at infrequent intervals. In long-lived clonal monocarps, seed production is expected to be positively related to the success of the clone in generating more and larger ramets during its lifetime. Ramification may be constrained by harvesting of culms, but it is unclear whether the reduction in productivity is proportional to the loss of reproductive biomass. We counted the seed produced by 661 culms (ramet stems) sampled from 90 clumps of the gregariously monocarpic bamboo Schizostachyum dullooa that is intensively harvested by villagers in northeastern India. The smallest clumps had fewer culms and few or no culms more than one year old. Seed production was indeed positively related to culm size and the number of culms in a clump. First-year culms were markedly more productive than older culms after controlling for culm diameter and clump size. There was a negative effect of clump size on productivity per culm which may occur because clumps that had been harvested heavily were able to exploit resources retained in rhizomes from harvested culms. Nevertheless, small clumps produced much less seed than larger clumps, generating a risk of unknown magnitude that heavily harvested stands of monocarpic bamboos may be unable to satiate seed predators during their single opportunity for reproduction.

TI The Ranging Costs of a Fallback Food: Liana Consumption Supplements Diet

AB Lianas are important components in the dynamics of tropical forests and represent fallback foods for some primates, yet little is known about their impact on primate ecology, behavior or fitness. Using 2 similar to yr of field data, we investigated liana consumption and foraging effort in four groups of howler monkeys (two in bigger, more conserved forest fragments and two in smaller, less conserved fragments) to assess whether howler monkeys use lianas when and where food availability is scarce, and how liana consumption is related to foraging effort. Howler monkeys in smaller fragments spent more time consuming lianas and liana consumption was negatively related to the consumption of preferred food resources (fruit and Ficus spp.). Further, travel time was positively related to liana feeding time, but not to tree feeding time, and howler monkeys visited a greater number of food patches when feeding from liana leaves than when feeding from tree leaves. Our results suggest that these increases in foraging effort were related to the fact that lianas are mainly a source of leaves, and that liana patch size was probably smaller than tree patch size. While these results were clear when analyzing all four groups combined, however, they were not always significant in each of the groups individually. We suggest that this may be related to the differences in group size, patch size and the availability of resources among groups. Further studies are necessary to assess whether these dietary and behavioral adjustments negatively impact on the fitness and conservation of primates in fragments.

AB Crepidorhopalon perennis is a metallophyte critically endangered by mining activities and currently known from only one site on copper-rich soils in Katanga (Dem. Rep. Congo). It is closely related to the annual C. tenuis, also a rare metallophyte, but with a broader geographical range. We investigated the variation in morphometric traits and ecological niches (based on edaphic conditions and pollinator assemblages) of C. perennis and C. tenuis, to evaluate the risk of inter-specific competition, and their potential for hybridization to ascertain if C. perennis might be at risk of genetic swamping by its more widespread congener. We examined whether species were found under sympatric or parapatric settings with opportunity for hybridization (or gene exchange). Such knowledge is essential for implementing restoration management protocols, including the introduction of C. perennis into substitution sites where C. tenuis might be already present. Fourteen morphological characters and 11 soil variables were measured and visiting pollinator species were identified at the site where the two species co-occur. Our results show that the two species can be distinguished based on their morphological traits, show niche overlap based on edaphic properties, and share the same pollinator assemblage. In addition, no morphologically intermediate individuals could be detected, suggesting no hybridization, and that the two species may be reproductively isolated. We conclude that C. perennis conservation and restoration operations can be realized in substitution sites where C. tenuis may be present, with the need, however, to evaluate the potential effect of sharing a pollinator assemblage on reproductive success of both species.

AB Nonnative ungulates can alter the structure and function of forest ecosystems. Feral pigs in particular pose a substantial threat to native plant communities throughout their global range. Hawaiian forests are exceptionally vulnerable to feral pig activity because native vegetation evolved in the absence of large mammalian herbivores. A common approach for conserving and restoring forests in Hawaii is fencing and removal of feral pigs. The extent of native plant community recovery and nonnative plant invasion following pig removal, however, is largely unknown. Our objective was to quantify changes in native and nonnative understory vegetation over a 16 yr period in adjacent fenced (pig-free) vs. unfenced (pig-present) Hawaiian montane wet forest. Native and nonnative understory vegetation responded strongly to feral pig removal. Density of native woody plants rooted in mineral soil increased sixfold in pig-free sites over 16 yr, whereas establishment was almost exclusively restricted to epiphytes in pig-present sites. Stem density of young tree ferns increased significantly (51.2%) in pig-free, but not pig-present sites. Herbaceous cover decreased over time in pig-present sites (67.9%). In both treatments, number of species remained constant and native woody plant establishment was limited to commonly occurring species. The nonnative invasive shrub, Psidium cattleianum, responded positively to release from pig disturbance with a fivefold increase in density in pig-free sites. These results suggest that while common native understory plants recover within 16 yr of pig removal, control of nonnative plants and outplanting of rarer native species are necessary components of sustainable conservation and restoration efforts in these forests.

AB The study of gap dynamics and the effects of gaps on diversity has been at the center of tropical ecology for decades. While most studies have focused on the responses of plant species and communities to gap formation, in this study, we consider the effects of treefall gap disturbances on leaf litter ant assemblages in a Neotropical montane cloud forest. We sampled leaf litter ant assemblages and estimated a suite of abiotic parameters in 12 large (>80-m2) treefall gaps across a chronosequence and in 12 paired adjacent intact forest sites in the Monteverde Cloud Forest Preserve in Costa Rica. No species were more common in gaps than in intact forests, and in fact, species that were common in gaps were also among the most common in forests. The Chao2 estimate of species richness, however, was higher in gap sites than in intact forest sites. In addition, ant assemblages in gap sites did not become more similar to those in adjacent intact sites as gaps aged. In contrast to other studies, our work demonstrates that ant assemblages in the Monteverde Cloud Forest Preserve are weakly affected by the formation of treefall gaps. Together, these results indicate that treefall gap dynamics probably play little role in promoting ant diversity at more regional scales, or coexistence among species at more local scales.

AB In the Ankarafantsika tropical dry forest (northwestern Madagascar), the common brown lemur (Eulemur fulvus fulvus) is the largest frugivore and probably the sole disperser of large-seeded plants (seed diameter > 10 mm). To investigate seed dispersal by this primate, I recorded the feeding activities of a troop; also conducted fecal analyses, germination trials on defecated seeds, and a vegetation survey over 1 yr (beginning Dec 2006). Brown lemurs mostly consumed fruit (68%). The fruit of Vitex beraviensis was the most exploited resource (21% of total feeding time). Among dung samples, 1126 contained intact seeds of 70 plant species, with a median of six seeds and two species per sample. These data indicate that the brown lemur population dispersed approximately 9854 seeds/km2/d. Although the number of annually defecated seeds was overwhelmingly the largest in Grewia triflora, many of the small seeds were often clumped in dung piles. In contrast, large seeds of V. beraviensis occurred in the largest number of dung samples. The rate and time of seed germination in V. beraviensis were improved by passage through brown lemur guts. Therefore, V. beraviensis may readily establish seedlings in sites of brown lemur fecal deposition. Vitex beraviensis and brown lemurs are probably involved in a strong mutualism. Twenty-three large-seeded plants were probably dependent on brown lemurs for seed dispersal and some of these species were common trees in the forest. Maintenance of these key plantanimal interactions will probably contribute to the conservation of species diversity and intact regeneration of the Ankarafantsika forest.

AB The movement of frugivores between remnant forests and successional areas is vital for tropical forest tree species to colonize successional habitats. The response of these species to the spatial structure of pasture tree cover is largely unknown. We studied avian frugivores that were found in primary forest edges and large pastures in eastern Amazonia, Brazil. We determined how the small-scale spatial structure of pasture trees at forest edges affects five response variables: bird presence, visitation rate, duration of visit, species richness, and an index accounting for species level of frugivory and abundance in forests. We used hierarchical linear models to estimate the effect of four predictor variables on response variables: (1) clustering of pasture trees; (2) percent canopy cover of pasture trees; (3) distance of pasture tree to forest edge; and (4) tree crown area. The study species, many of which are widely distributed in the Neotropics, were generally insensitive to percent cover and clustering of trees. Frugivore visitation to individual trees remained constant as cover increased. Visitation was positively correlated with focal tree distance to forest edge and crown area. The positive relationship between distance and visitation rates may be due to the increased abundance of some resource further from forests. If pastures were abandoned the distance from forest edges would not likely limit frugivore visitation and seed deposition under large pasture trees in our study (i.e., up to 200 m distant).

AB Multiple predators often have effects on their common prey populations that cannot be predicted by summing the effects of each predator at a time. When predators forage on the same vegetation substrate, intraguild interactions might cause emergent outcomes for the plants on which the predators co-occur. We experimentally evaluated the effects of spiders and ants on herbivory and reproduction in the extrafloral nectary-bearing tree Qualea multiflora (Vochysiaceae). Plants were divided in four experimental groups, depending on the presence or absence of ants and spiders. We compared the effects of each treatment on richness and abundance of chewing and sucking herbivores and on herbivory (leaf area loss). We also evaluated the impact of predators on the production of buds, fruits and seeds, and weight of the fruits. The presence of ants reduced the abundance and richness of spiders, but spiders did not affect the abundance and richness of ants. Only the removal of ants resulted in a significant increase in the abundance of herbivores and herbivore richness. Herbivory, however, was also affected by spiders. In addition, we found a significant interaction effect of ants and spiders on herbivory, indicating an emergent multiple predator effect. Neither ants nor spiders had an impact on the number of buds produced, number of fruits per bud, and seeds per fruits or fruit weight. This study highlights the importance of evaluating the effect of the predator fauna as a whole and not only one specific group on herbivory.

AB Darwin and Wallace, in the mid-nineteenth century, were the first to document examples of natural selection acting on island dwellers. A century later a pattern of morphological differences among organisms on islands was coined the island rule, which states that on islands species with small individuals tend toward gigantism and large individuals tend toward dwarfism. Selective pressures such as limited resources and increased intraspecific competition modulate the size of organisms in these environments. Of the several works that have tested vertebrates for adherence to the island rule only two have addressed amphibians. This work is the third record of body size variation of island amphibian populations, and the first for the Southern Hemisphere. The islands investigated were once continuous with mainland, and now are isolated as a result of sea level fluctuations that took place in the Pleistocene and Holocene. This study compared morphometric variation in populations of Rhinella ornata (Bufonidae) occurring on three islands of the Costa Verde to populations on five continental areas in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. We measured 18 morphometric variables of 177 individuals. There was a shift toward smaller body size (dwarfism) in two of the three island populations studied. We attribute this general pattern to geographic factors, verifying the expression of the island rule in tropical frogs populations (insular dwarfism) operating inversely in relation to those of temperate environments (island gigantism).

AB The breathing behavior of the jeju fish Hoplerythrinus unitaeniatus has been the focus of several studies in recent decades. Few of these studies, however, have described how the fish's air breathing functions in natural environments. We examined changes in the behavior of H. unitaeniatus during daily variations in the dissolved-oxygen (DO) content of the water in Amazonian streams. We recorded the mean time intervals between instances when the fish breached the water surface to take in atmospheric air and the variation in the DO concentrations. We also observed the number of individual fish that breached the surface together as well as their territory-forming behavior. We recorded the individual and collective anti-predator strategies in the presence of a potential predator, experimentally testing the capacity of H. unitaeniatus to recognize the shape of a predator. The results indicated that as the DO concentration decreased, the individuals of H. unitaeniatus tended to breach the water surface at shorter time intervals, which increased their exposure to predators. To minimize the risks from this longer exposure time, the species tends to adopt anti-predator strategies individually or as a group. In well-lit locations, the fish recognized the predator's silhouette, left their territory and took a longer time to return. We provide an original contribution to the understanding of the anti-predatory tactics of the species by describing the behavior of group formation and territory definition as a tool to maximize efficiency in the defense against predators, a behavior that until now was an unknown strategy for this species.

AB The Gambia River of West Africa is a large unobstructed river, characterized by a natural flow regime and lateral connectivity across its floodplain. Construction of a major dam, however, is planned. We compared patterns of fish diversity, habitat use, assemblage structure, and the distribution of trophic position and body morphology in riverine and floodplain habitats in Niokolo Koba National Park, located downstream of the planned dam site. A total of 49 fish species were captured, revealing a lognormal distribution as expected for species-rich assemblages. Fish species exhibited a range of habitat use patterns, from generalist to highly habitat-specific, and appeared to migrate laterally among habitats between seasons. Species richness was homogenous among habitats in the wet season yet appeared to increase with isolation from the main river in the dry season. Fish assemblage structure was best explained by the interaction between habitat type and season, underlining the importance of the natural flow regime and lateral connectivity among floodplain habitats. The abundance of fishes having elongate bodies increased with isolation from the main channel in the wet season only. The distribution of fishes having compressed cross-sectional morphology decreased with isolation from the main channel in the dry season only. These patterns of trait distribution support the conclusion that variation in hydrologic connectivity structures the fish assemblage. Our results suggest that altered flow regimes and loss of floodplain habitats after damming could lead to both decreased taxonomic and functional diversity of the fish assemblage.

AB Studying large mammal species in tropical forests is a conservation challenge with species behavior and ecology often increasing the probability of non-detection during surveys. Consequently, knowledge of the distribution, status, and natural history of many large mammal species in Southeast Asia is limited. I developed occupancy models from camera-trapping data, thereby accounting for imperfect detection at sampling sites, to clarify the status and habitat requirements of four globally threatened or near threatened large mammals (banteng Bos javanicus, gaur Bos gaurus, dhole Cuon alpinus, and leopard Panthera pardus) in Mondulkiri Protected Forest, eastern Cambodia. Camera traps were operational for >3500 trap nights with 202 photographic encounters of the four study species. Model averaged occupancy estimates were between 5 percent (leopard) and 140 percent (gaur) higher than naive estimates (i.e., proportion of camera-trap sites species recorded from) thus highlighting the importance of accounting for detectability during conservation surveys. I recommend the use of an occupancy framework when using camera-trap data to study the status, ecology, and habitat preferences of poorly known and elusive species. The results highlight the importance of mixed deciduous and semi-evergreen forest for wild cattle in eastern Cambodia and I emphasize that these habitats must be considered in conservation planning across the Lower Mekong Dry Forest Ecoregion.

AB The Amazon basin holds very high parrot species richness but almost nothing is known of parrot population densities in the region or how these vary between species, habitats, sites, and seasons. Such data are becoming important as humans impact on increasing areas of the region. Seventeen parrot species were surveyed using a line transect distance sampling method over 3 yr in floodplain and terra firme forests at two sites in the Tambopata region of southeast Peru. Density estimates for most species were in the range of 3.37.8/km2, with Brotogeris cyanoptera and Amazona farinosa reaching densities of 22 and 23/km2 in floodplain forest during the dry season. Parrot densities were higher in floodplain forest than in terra firme forest at both sites. The parrot communities of terra firme forests were similar across sites and seasons, but those in floodplain forests differed widely across sites and across seasons. Upper canopy birds are notoriously difficult to survey. We introduce a procedure to correct for the likely violation of the assumption that all birds on the transect line are detected (distance sampling assumption g(0) = 1). We correct g(0) based on calling rates of birds using a cue-counting technique. Multipliers for g(0) differ across species and site, but not season. This method yielded density estimates on average 22 percent higher (640% higher in individual species) than those from the standard method.

AB Spatial heterogeneity in the plant species composition of tropical forests is expected to influence animal species abundance and composition because vegetation constitutes the primary habitat feature for forest animals. Floristic variation is tied to variation in soils, so edaphic properties should ultimately influence animal species composition as well. The study of covariation in floristic and faunistic turnover has been hindered by the difficulty of completing coordinated surveys in hyperdiverse tropical communities, but this can be overcome with the use of a few plant taxa that function as surrogates for general floristic turnover. We used avian and plant transect surveys and soil sampling in a western Amazonian upland (terra firme) forest landscape to test whether spatial variation in bird community composition is associated with floristic turnover and corresponding edaphic gradients. Partial Mantel tests and Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling showed floristic distinctiveness between two forest types closely associated with differences in soil cation concentrations, and differences in both floristic composition and cation concentrations were further linked to compositional differences in avian species, independent of geographic distances among sites. Ten percent of bird species included in Indicator Species Analyses showed significant associations with one of the two forest types. The upland forest types that we sampled, each corresponding to a different geological formation, are intermediate relative to edaphically extreme environments in the region. Models of avian diversification should take into account this environmental heterogeneity, as should conservation planning approaches that aim to represent faunal diversity. Abstract in Spanish is available in the online version of this article.

AB Most animals have well established diel activity patterns (e.g., diurnal, crepuscular, or nocturnal), and changes in behavior from diurnal to nocturnal are rare in single species. We radio tracked 50 keelback snakes in a single population, locating them up to four times a day, over five periods of the year in the Australian dry tropics to describe temporal variation in diel movement patterns. Snake body temperatures were also recorded to determine the relationship between activity patterns and body temperatures. Season influenced diel activity patterns significantly. Keelbacks were more likely to move, and moved further in the daytime in the mid-dry (JuneJuly), and late dry (AugSep) seasons. In the mid-dry season, 87 percent of movements were diurnal, whereas in the mid-wet (FebMarch) season, although snakes were much more likely to move, only 43 percent of movements were diurnal. In the late dry season, snakes were slightly more likely to move at night than at any other time of day, and so at this time of the year, snakes could be classified as nocturnal. Thus, overall increased movements in the mid-wet season (austral summer) were associated with more crepuscular and nocturnal movement. There was a significant relationship between individual snake body temperatures and movement rates in all seasons. Changes in movement patterns may be related to body temperature, and this diurnal species becomes cathemeral in the tropics in summer, when it is possible to maintain high body temperatures both day and night.

AB Forest loss and fragmentation threaten many primates globally, and often leads to a reduction in food resources. During a 22-mo period, the foraging ecology of the critically endangered kipunji Rungwecebus kipunji was studied in the heterogeneous RungweLivingstone forests, southwest Tanzania, to identify periods of possible ecological stress, fallback foods used by the species, and the impact of forest disturbance on feeding resources. The studied group had a wide diet and was predominantly frugivorous. Fruit consumption was driven by fruit availability which peaked during the wet season, and dipped during the driest months. During this period, two fallback foods: mature leaves and pith were widely consumed, with Macaranga capensis an essential fallback species. a diversity and evenness of diet was remarkably similar across months, but there was high beta diversity in diets at the cusp of wet and dry seasons, and during periods of low fruit availability. This suggests considerable dietary adaptability to fluctuating resources, which may act to buffer against further forest disturbance. Tree species associated with relatively undisturbed forest were significantly more important in the diet, especially in the dry season, than those of disturbed forests. Regeneration of key trees (determined through counting of seedlings and saplings in plots) appeared healthy except in two important Ficus species. Conservation management, while focusing on promoting old growth forest, should also consider populations of some important pioneer tree species such as Macaranga capensis both inside the forest and in any reforestation schemes outside the species current area of occupancy.

AB Pythons are harvested for the international leather industry and pet trade. We analyzed the CITES export records (1999-2008) of the most intensively commercialized wild pythons (Python regius, Python sebae, Python reticulatus, Python molurus, Python curtus species complex) from African and Asian countries where reliable data on trade rates and ecology are available. Mean declared annual numbers of exported pythons were 30,000 in five African countries and 164,000 in Indonesia. Trade intensity tripled in Indonesia over the last decade, but declined in Africa. African international trade is exclusively associated with the pet market (mainly United States and Europe), whereas Asian pythons are sold mostly for luxury leather, albeit more recently also for the pet trade. A negative correlation between the annual numbers of pythons traded in Africa vs. Asia suggests a rapid and recent shift of the pressure exerted on wild populations in the two main exporting continents. We also found a strong effect of the currency exchange rate (i.e., U.S.$/epsilon, the currencies used by the major importing countries) on African python exports: when the cost per African python increased, importers relied increasingly on Asian providers for pet trade. Overall, our data indicate that Asian pythons (especially P. reticulatus) might be threatened due to the rapidly increasing pressure, whereas the decreasing international trade in African pythons is likely more sustainable.

AB Soil characteristics are important drivers of variation in wet tropical forest structure and diversity, but few studies have evaluated these relationships in drier forest types. Using tree and soil data from 48 and 32 1 ha plots, respectively, in a Bolivian moist and dry forest, we asked how soil conditions affect forest structure and diversity within each of the two forest types. After correcting for spatial effects, soil-vegetation relationships differed between the dry and the moist forest, being strongest in the dry forest. Furthermore, we hypothesized that soil nutrients would play a more important role in the moist forest than in the dry forest because vegetation in the moist forest is less constrained by water availability and thus can show its full potential response to soil fertility. However, contrary to our expectations, we found that soil fertility explained a larger number of forest variables in the dry forest (50 percent) than in the moist forest (17 percent). Shannon diversity declined with soil fertility at both sites, probably because the most dominant, shade-tolerant species strongly increased in abundance as soil fertility increased.

AB The realized species richness of tropical forests cannot yet be reliably mapped at a regional scale due to lack of systematically collected data. An estimate of the potential species richness (PSR), however, can be produced through the use of species distribution modelling. PSR is interpretable as a climatically determined upper limit to observed species richness. We mapped current PSR and future PSR under climate change scenarios for Mesoamerica by combining the spatial distributions of 2000 tree species as predicted by generalized additive models built from herbaria records and climate layers. An explanatory regression tree was used to extract conditional rules describing the relationship between PSR and climate. The results were summarized by country, ecoregion and protected area status in order to investigate current and possible future variability in PSR in the context of regional biodiversity conservation. Length of the dry season was found to be the key determinant of PSR. Protected areas were found to have higher median PSR values than unprotected areas in most of the countries within the study area. Areas with exceptionally high PSR, however, remain unprotected throughout the region. Neither changes in realized species richness nor extinctions will necessarily follow changes in modelled PSR under climate change. However model output suggests that an increase in temperature of around 3 degrees C, combined with a 20 percent decrease in rainfall could lead to a widespread reduction of around 15 percent of current PSR, with values of up to 40 percent in some moist lower montane tropical forests. The modelled PSR of dry forest ecoregions was found to be relatively stable. Some cooler upper montane forests in northern Mesoamerica, where few species of tropical origin are currently found, may gain PSR if species are free to migrate.

AB Spatially separated ecosystems are often linked by nutrient fluxes. Nutrient inputs may be transferred by physical vectors (i.e., wind and water) or by biotic vectors. In this study, we examine the role of green turtles (Chelonia mydas) as biotic transporters of nutrients from marine to terrestrial ecosystems, where they deposit eggs. We compare low and high nest density sites at Tortuguero, Costa Rica, the largest green turtle rookery in the western hemisphere. Four plant species (Costus woodsonii, Hibiscus pernanbucensis, Hymenocallis littoralis, Ipomoea pes-caprae) were analyzed at both nest density sites for N-15, total carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus, and vegetation cover. Sand was analyzed for N-15 and total nitrogen. Vegetation at high nest density sites had higher total nitrogen, which was correlated with higher delta N-15 values, suggesting nutrient input from a marine source. The dominant plant species changed between low and high nest density sites, indicating that turtle-derived nutrients may alter the plant community composition. The trend in delta N-15 values of sand was similar, although less pronounced than that of the vegetation. Sand may be a poor integrator of nutrient input due to low nutrient adsorption and high rate of leaching. Sea turtles have previously been shown to deposit considerable amounts of nutrients and energy on nesting beaches. In this study, we estimate annual nitrogen and phosphorus contributions at Tortuguero are 507 and 45 kg/km, respectively, and we demonstrate that beach vegetation likely assimilates a portion of these marine-derived nutrients.

AB Scant information is available on how soil phosphorus (P) availability responds to atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition, especially in the tropical zones. This study examined the effect of N addition on soil P availability, and compared this effect between forest sites of contrasting land-use history. Effects of N addition on soil properties, litterfall production, P release from decomposing litter, and soil P availability were studied in a disturbed (reforested pine forest with previous understory vegetation and litter harvesting) and a rehabilitated (reforested mixed pine/broadleaf forest with no understory vegetation and litter harvesting) tropical forest in southern China. Experimental N-treatments (above ambient) were the following: Control (no N addition), N50 (50 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)), and N100 (100 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)). Results indicated that N addition significantly decreased soil P availability in the disturbed forest. In the rehabilitated forest, however, soil P availability was significantly increased by N addition. Decreases in soil P availability may be correlated with decreases in rates of P release from decomposing litter in the N-treated plots, whereas the increase in soil P availability was correlated with an increase in litterfall production. Our results suggest that response of soil P availability to N deposition in the reforested tropical forests in southern China may vary greatly with temporal changes in tree species composition and soil nutrient status, caused by different land-use practices.

AB We evaluated growth responses to gap formation for juvenile individuals of three canopy rain forest species: Peltogyne cf. heterophylla, Clarisia racemosa and Cedrelinga catenaeformis. Gaps were formed during selective logging operations 7 yr before sampling in a Bolivian rain forest. We collected wood samples for tree-ring analyses at different distances to the stump (<10, 1040 and >40 m) and from trees with different diameters (530 cm diameter at breast height [dbh]). Tree-rings width was measured in at least two radii and converted to average diameter growth. Changes in 7-yr median diameter growth before and after selective logging were analyzed. Diameter growth rates significantly increased by 0.70.8 mm/yr after gap formation for P. heterophylla and C. catenaeformis, but not for C. racemosa. We applied a multiple regression analysis to explain variation in growth responses of P. heterophylla and C. catenaeformis by distance to logging gap and tree size. For P. heterophylla we found that growth increase occurring close to logging gaps was strongest for large juvenile trees (2025 cm dbh) and almost absent in small juveniles. For C. catenaeformis, variation in growth responses was not related to tree size or distance to gaps. Our results show that growth responses to gap formation strongly differ across species and tree sizes. This finding calls for caution in the interpretation of growth releases in tree-ring series, as gap formation does not necessarily invoke growth responses and if such growth responses occur, their strength is species- and size specific. Foreign language abstract is available in the online version of this article.

AB Habitat loss and fragmentation are considered major threats to biodiversity, especially in tropical mountain ecosystems. Most studies focus on the relationships between biodiversity and patch characteristics such as patch size, connectivity or degree of contrast with the surrounding matrix, but leave the rate of change within these variables little explored. We analyzed the importance of changes in patch characteristics over time on species diversity and species composition in the paramo of northern Peru, a tropical grassland ecosystem, locally known as jalca. We obtained land use/cover maps for 1987 and 2007 spanning an area of 6300 km(2), and quantified land use change, jalca patch characteristics and their proportional changes over 20 yr. In 2009, 371 vascular plant species were recorded in 92 plots, each plot representative of single patches. Between 1987 and 2007, jalca cover decreased from 47 to 35 percent due to encroaching agriculture. This activity showed an upward shift probably favored by climate change. The number of jalca patches increased, mean patch size decreased, and the patches showed a higher contrast with the surrounding matrix. Multiple linear regression failed to show that species diversity relates to changes in patch characteristics. Canonical correspondence analysis indicated that species composition relates to the degree of contrast between the patch and its surrounding matrix and its changes through time. We concluded that changes in patch characteristics are important only for species composition. This study highlights the importance of considering matrix management with a long term perspective for conservation efforts.

AB Understanding tree growth in response to rainfall distribution is critical to predicting forest and species population responses to climate change. We investigated inter-annual and seasonal variation in stem diameter by three emergent tree species in a seasonally dry tropical forest in southeast Para, Brazil. Annual diameter growth rates by Swietenia macrophylla demonstrated strong positive correlation with annual rainfall totals during 19972009; Hymenaea courbaril growth rates demonstrated weak positive correlation, whereas Parkia pendula exhibited weak negative correlation. For both Swietenia and Hymenaea, annual diameter growth rates correlated positively and significantly with rainfall totals during the first 6 mo of the growing year (July to December). Vernier dendrometer bands monitored at 4-wk intervals during 35 yr confirmed strong seasonal effects on stem diameter expansion. Individuals of all three species expanded in unison during wet season months and were static or even contracted during dry season months. Stems of the deciduous Swietenia contracted as crowns were shed during the early dry season, expanded slightly as new crowns were flushed, and then contracted further during 35 wk flowering periods in the late dry season by newly mature crowns. The three species physiographic distribution patterns at the study site may partially underlie observed differences in annual and seasonal growth. With most global circulation models predicting conditions becoming gradually drier in southeast Amazonia over the coming decades, species such as Swietenia that perform best on the wet end of current conditions may experience reduced growth rates. However, population viability will not necessarily be threatened if life history and ecophysiological responses to changing conditions are compensatory.

AB Shade coffee plantations can be important refuges for epiphytes, but are not suitable for all species. To test if the performance of early life stages, often the most sensitive phase, is responsible for the species ability to colonize coffee plantations, we compared growth and mortality rates of three epiphytic bromeliad species that differ in their ability to colonize secondary arboreal vegetation by transplanting juveniles to trees in forests, and shade trees in old and young coffee plantations in Central Veracruz, Mexico. Growth rates of Tillandsia viridiflora, generally restricted to forests, and Tillandsia juncea, an early colonizer, were related to the pattern of the species occurrence among habitats with growth rates of T. viridiflora being generally higher in forests and growth of T. juncea higher in coffee plantations. Performance of the third species, Tillandsia heterophylla, which is intermediate in habitat preference, was not clearly related to habitat. No difference in growth rates was found between plants transplanted in wet or dry season. In general, mortality in transplanted bromeliads was relatively low (mostly < 5% per month). In coffee plantations herbivory had a severe effect during part of the wet season, when mortality in young coffee plantations reached between 15 and 24 percent per month. Given the substantial contribution of herbivory to the mortality of juvenile plants and the significant differences between habitats, herbivory may be co-limiting the colonization of young coffee plantations by some epiphytic bromeliads.

AB An important question for tropical forest restoration is whether degraded lands can be actively managed to attract birds. We censused birds and measured vegetation structure at 27 stations in young (69-yr old) actively and passively restored pasture and old growth forest at Las Cruces Biological Station in southern Costa Rica. During 481 10-min point counts, we detected a high diversity186 speciesof birds using the restoration area. Surprisingly, species richness and detection frequency did not differ among habitats, and proportional similarity of bird assemblages to old growth forest did not differ between restoration treatments. Bird detection frequency was instead explained by exotic grass cover and understory stem densityvegetation structures that were not strongly impacted by active restoration. The similarity of bird assemblages in actively and passively restored forest may be attributed to differential habitat preferences within and among feeding guilds, low structural contrast between treatments, or the effect of nucleation from actively restored plots into passively restored areas. Rapid recovery of vegetation in this recently restored site is likely due to its proximity to old growth forest and the lack of barriers to effective seed dispersal. Previous restoration studies in highly binary environments (i.e., open pasture vs. tree plantation) have found strong differences in bird abundance and richness. Our data contradict this trend, and suggest that tropical restoration ecologists should carefully consider: (1) when the benefits of active restoration outweigh the cost of implementation; and (2) which avian guilds should be used to measure restoration success given differential responses to habitat structure. Foreign language abstract is available in the online version of this article.

AB Ants frequently interact with fleshy fallen diaspores (fruits or seeds) not adapted for ant-dispersal. Such interactions are usually considered as opportunistic, but recent evidence has indicated that these ants may differ in their effects on diaspore survival and plant recruitment. We investigated if partner choices are recognizable among genera of ants and plants, and if ant and plant traits may influence such preferences in cerrado (savanna-like vegetation) from southeast Brazil. During a 2-yr period, 521 antdiaspore interactions were recorded through various methods, yielding 71 ant species and 38 plant species. Exploitation of fallen diaspores was common among several ant genera, and included carnivorous, omnivorous, and fungivorous ants. Contrary to others areas around the world, where true myrmecochory (seed dispersal by ants) is common among shrubs, ants also exploited diaspores from several cerrado trees. Plant life form, diaspore size, and ant body size did not seem to explain the pattern of interactions observed. Two subsets of preferential interactions, however, segregated fungivorous ants from another group composed of carnivorous and omnivorous ants, probably influenced by the chemical composition of the plant diaspores. Omnivorous ants usually remove the fleshy portion of diaspores on spot and probably provide limited benefits to plants. Carnivorous and fungivorous ants usually remove the whole diaspore to the nest. As each of these ant groups may influence the fitness of diaspores in different ways, there are possible subtle pathways for the evolution of partner choices between ants and these non-myrmecochorous diaspores.

AB Conversion of natural forest to oil palm plantations is a major threat to biodiversity in Southeast Asia. The retention of natural forest habitats within plantations has been proposed as a method to reduce biodiversity losses in agricultural areas, and we examined whether forest areas resulted in spillover of species into adjacent oil palm plantations. We sampled ants and butterflies along two 2-km transects across an ecotone from plantation into adjacent forest in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. Species richness of both taxa was reduced in plantations, but to a greater extent in butterflies (54% reduction) than in ants (25% reduction). Butterfly diversity increased in plantations with increasing proximity to forest primarily due to spillover of vagrant forest species (whose larval host plants do not occur in plantations), although richness of species that could potentially breed in plantations also increased near to forest. By contrast, ants showed no spillover effects and were less sensitive to land-use changes, with much higher levels of similarity in species assemblages across habitats than for butterflies. Our results for butterflies suggest that despite the negative impacts of plantations on diversity, proximity to forest could improve diversity in adjacent plantations for some taxa. Spillover of forest species implies that retaining forest areas within plantations may be important for facilitating dispersal of some species through the landscape.

AB Within-site variability in species detectability is a problem common to many biodiversity assessments and can strongly bias the results. Such variability can be caused by many factors, including simple counting inaccuracies, which can be solved by increasing sample size, or by temporal changes in species behavior, meaning that the way the temporal sampling protocol is designed is also very important. Here we use the example of mist-netted tropical birds to determine how design decisions in the temporal sampling protocol can alter the data collected and how these changes might affect the detection of ecological patterns, such as the species-area relationship (SAR). Using data from almost 3400 birds captured from 21,000 net-hours at 31 sites in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, we found that the magnitude of ecological trends remained fairly stable, but the probability of detecting statistically significant ecological patterns varied depending on sampling effort, time of day and season in which sampling was conducted. For example, more species were detected in the wet season, but the SAR was strongest in the dry season. We found that the temporal distribution of sampling effort was more important than its total amount, discovering that similar ecological results could have been obtained with one-third of the total effort, as long as each site had been equally sampled over 2 yr. We discuss that projects with the same sampling effort and spatial design, but with different temporal sampling protocol are likely to report different ecological patterns, which may ultimately lead to inappropriate conservation strategies.

AB Frugivorous are one of the main diaspore dispersers in tropical ecosystems, particularly in open areas and sites in the early stages of ecological succession. Frugivorous bat species respond differentially to habitat modification, and in the context of their diaspore dispersal functions it is important to understand species' ecological requirements. We compared the diversity of diaspores, obtained from fecal samples and from fruits carried by frugivorous bats, among five shaded coffee plantations under different management regimes and a montane rain forest in southeastern Chiapas, Mexico. At each site, bats were captured every 2 mo from March 2004 to July 2005, using six mist-nets, during two consecutive nights. We captured 2589 individuals from 18 frugivorous species, from which we collected 969 fecal samples, containing 42 diaspore species associated with early and late successional plants. Although, we captured more frugivorous bat species in montane rain forest, the number of diaspore species in this site (N=14) was not significantly different from the coffee plantations under different management regimes (1624). In montane rain forest, Sturnira ludovici fed mainly on Piper auritum, but in coffee plantations ate Peperomia sp., Saurauia madrensis, Solanum chrysotrichum and Solanum diphyllum. Artibeus jamaicensis and Artibeus intermedius feed mostly Cecropia obtusifolia and Ficus cookii in all coffee plantations. We suggest that the presence of frugivorous bats in shaded coffee plantations is favored by trees and shrubs associated with secondary and introduced vegetation that farmers have allowed to grow within or around the plantations.

AB We assessed the effects of a high-intensity hurricane on the abundance of nine game species in the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico. We sampled 370 km of linear transects in the 3 yr before the hurricane (i.e., 20032005), and 315 km in 3 yr after the hurricane (20082010). Relative track abundances of all species declined by two-thirds of their prehurricane values. Abundances of Central American agouti Dasyprocta punctata, white-tailed deer Odocoileus virginianus, paca Cuniculus paca, and Great Curassow Crax rubra declined significantly after the hurricane swept the area. Relative track abundances showed a negative, but nonsignificant trend for Ocellated Turkey Meleagris ocellata, white-nosed coati Nasua narica, brocket deer Mazama sp., and collared peccary Pecari tajacu. Only nine-banded armadillo Dasypus novemcinctus showed a significant increase in abundance. Strictly frugivore and habitat specialist species were more affected than omnivores and habitat generalist species. These latter characteristics, or their combination, seemed advantageous to withstand the stress of habitat disturbance. The trend of posthurricane recovery was incipient for affected species, and it was significant for five species after the impact. Overall, most frugivores and habitat specialists did not reach their prehurricane relative track abundances, and Great Curassow showed no recovery trend. The future expectation of increased frequency and intensity of hurricanes might have severe effects on such species.

AB Traditional approaches to the study of species persistence in fragmented landscapes generally consider a binary classification of habitat being suitable or unsuitable; however, the range of human-modified habitats within a region may offer a gradient of habitat suitability (or conservation value) for species. We identified such a gradient by comparing bird assemblages among contrasting land uses (pine plantations of different age, annual crops, clear cuts and cattle pastures) in the Upper Parana Atlantic forest. Bird assemblages and vegetation structure were characterized in an extensive area of 4400 km(2) in Argentina and Paraguay during the breeding seasons of 2005-2010. Similarity of bird assemblages between anthropogenic habitats and the native forest and the proportion of forest species increased with vegetation vertical structure, while the proportion of open-area species decreased. As a consequence, mature tree plantations were the most suitable habitats for forest species and were mainly used by frugivores and bark insectivores. In contrast, open habitats were the least suitable habitat for forest species and were used primarily by insectivores. Human-created habitats that are structurally complex can be used by a subset of forest species, and may improve functional connectivity and mitigate edge effects. The conservation of large tracks of native forests, however, is critical for the long-term persistence of the entire bird assemblage, especially for native forest dependent species.

AB Atelopus is among the most threatened of all amphibian genera. Most species of harlequin frogs disappeared more than two decades ago and only a few still exist. From ten critically endangered Atelopus species endemic to Venezuela, Atelopus cruciger is the only one that can be located at present. To assess the status of remnant populations of A. cruciger and to provide the demographic data for designing in situ management programs, we estimated: (1) the population size; (2) the apparent survival; and (3) the recruitment rates of one remnant population using mark-recapture data. The adult population size varied (69117), and this variation was not related to that of abundance indices based on visual counts at the river margins. Thus, caution is recommended when using visual counts as an index of abundance in Atelopus, because capture rates differ significantly among months and between seasons. Despite the observed variations, this population appears to be stable. Previous reports suggest that species of Atelopus are long-lived. For populations of long-lived species to remain approximately constant, recruitment must be low. Our mark-recapture study, however, showed that adults tend to remain in the population for approximately 15 mo, but an average of 165 new frogs are recruited every year. Although immigration and emigration are possibilities, the site fidelity and the absence of nearby streams suggests that movement in and out of the study area is less important than births and deaths. Under the proposed hypothesis of a short life expectancy/high recruitment, the risk of extinction must be lower than previously thought.

AB Forests worldwide are experiencing rapid environmental change due to human activity. We aimed to increase understanding of anthropogenic impacts on community composition and species interactions. In a natural experiment, we asked whether subsistence human land use has altered the community composition of a Neotropical rain forest on the island of Tobago, in the West Indies. We surveyed fruiting plants and birds in three adjacent habitat types that varied in level of disturbance, and used multivariate analyses to determine whether changes in the plant community were associated with differences in avifauna composition. The three forest habitats had similar plant and bird diversities, yet markedly different species compositions and abundances. Primary forest had the most diverse plant community, while disturbed habitats had a more homogeneous plant composition. Primary and disturbed forest had distinct community compositions, with canopy cover and the relative abundance of plant types explaining 83 percent of the variation in bird species assemblages. Seemingly moderate human disturbance has led to substantial changes in the plant and bird assemblages of Tobago's rain forest, outside of a protected reserve. Our study highlights the direct links between human disturbance and the structure of rain forests, underscoring the impact of even moderate activity on community composition. Foreign language abstract is available in the online version of this article.

AB The recovery of giant otter populations after the hunting prohibition and restriction of the pelt trade resulted in more frequent conflicts with fishermen. In this study, fishermangiant otter conflicts were analyzed in the Uacari Sustainable Development Reserve, where giant otters are accused of interfering with fisheries by eating the fish (predation), frightening the fish away (local interference), and damaging fishing equipment (direct interference). Interference by predation was analyzed by evaluating overlap in fish species consumption between humans (measured by subsistence and commercial catches) and giant otters. The giant otter diet was assessed from fecal samples, and the human diet through questionnaires. Local and direct interferences were analyzed through fish samples using gillnets and comparing capture efficiency with and without giant otters presence. The overlap between human and giant otter diets was low (0.37), varied seasonally, and was smaller in the low water (0.24) than in the high water period (0.60), when both species tend to be more generalists. Overlap between fish species consumed by giant otters and those exploited by commercial fisheries was small (0.34). Giant otter presence during the experimental fishing was low (9.5%), restricted to the high water period, and did not significantly reduce the captures (U = 13, P = 0.61). The low overlap in diet may be a result of differences in preferences and fishing strategies. The conflict between giant otters and fishermen is greater in the high water period, when the income of the fisheries decreases; however, the conflict seems to be mainly motivated by the resident's prejudice against giant otters.

AB Gape morphology has been linked to feeding and breeding ecology in raptors, according to the ingestion rate hypothesis. Mammal feeding raptors have larger gapes, allowing them to ingest prey more rapidly than bird feeders, which have evolved smaller average body sizes and gapes to capture more agile prey. One highly derived raptor, however, the Bat Hawk (Macheiramphus alcinus), specializes on colonial bats and swiftlets concentrated daily in a limited temporal window by capturing and swallowing them whole in flight. We hypothesized that the gape of the Bat Hawk evolved to feed rapidly on agile vertebrates limited temporally. We predicted that the gape of the Bat Hawk would be significantly larger than the gape of other raptors, more closely resembling the gapes of swifts (Apodidae), swallows (Hirundinidae), and goatsuckers (Caprimulgiformes). We measured gape area of the lower mandible in museum specimens representing 138 bird species in six orders. We also compared gape area by prey type in over 100 raptor species in three orders. We predicted that insectivorous raptors would exhibit gapes similar to mammal feeders but would differ from bird feeders because insects are not agile prey. The Bat Hawk had the largest gape of any raptor and more closely resembled the gape of insectivorous birds, which also swallow prey whole in flight. The evolution of an enlarged gape may have permitted the Bat Hawk to exploit a previously unrealized ecological niche. Gapes of bird feeding raptors were smaller than in mammal and insect feeders, supporting the ingestion rate hypothesis.

AB Cyclones, which change tree communities and alter forest structure, are thought to have had a significant selective pressure on the flora and fauna of Madagascar. Very little information, however, is available on the actual impact of cyclones on Malagasy ecosystems. On 21 January 2009, Cyclone Fanele made landfall on the western coast of Madagascar with sustained winds of 185 km/h. We examined the immediate effects of the cyclone on tropical dry forest structure in the Kirindy Mitea National Park. In July and August 2009, we measured the height, diameter at breast height (dbh), and damage for 1361 trees in nine 25 x 25 m plots. We found that: (1) over 95 percent of trees experienced some sort of damage, including 8.8 percent mortality; (2) understory and emergent trees experienced significantly higher mortality than canopy trees; and (3) stem density was reduced 9.2 +/- 4.5 percent and biomass was reduced 13.4 +/- 8.1 percent after the cyclone. Dbh was the best predictor of trunk damage and mortality. This extensive alteration of forest structure will have a substantial short- and long-term impact on the biotic communities of western Madagascar.

AB The functional groups of plants that characterize different phases of succession are expected to show differences in root distribution, fine-root traits and degrees of association with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. The relationship involving fine-root traits and AM fungi that regulate the nutrient acquisition potential among different plant functional groups are still not well understood. We assessed fine-root morphology, AM fungal variables and soil fertility in grassland, secondary forest and mature forest in Atlantic, Araucaria and Pantanal ecosystems in Brazil. Soil cores were collected at 010 and 1020 cm depths. Fine roots were extracted from soil by sieving and root morphological traits and AM colonization were determined. The AM spores were extracted from soil and counted. In all ecosystems, soil fertility, fine-root mass and root diameter increased with the succession, while root length, specific root length, root-hair length, root-hair incidence, AM colonization and AM spore density decreased. These results suggest that plant species from early stages of tropical succession with inherent rapid growth invest in fine roots and maintain a high degree of AM colonization in order to increase the capacity for nutrient acquisition. Conversely, fine root morphological characteristics and low degree of AM colonization exhibited by plants of the later stages of succession lead toward a low nutrient uptake capacity that combine with their typical low growth rates.

AB Research on tropical dry forest (TDF) succession i0s needed for effective conservation and management of this threatened and understudied ecosystem. We used a highly replicated chronosequence within a 37,242-ha TDF landscape to investigate successional patterns by plant size class and to evaluate the influence of stand age, topographic position, soil properties and spatial autocorrelation on forest structure and composition. We used a SPOT5 satellite image to obtain a land-cover thematic map, and sampled woody vegetation (adults: >5 cm diam; saplings: 15 cm) and soil properties in 168 plots distributed among four vegetation classes: VC1 (38-yr-old forest), VC2 (915-yr-old forest), VC3 (>15-yr-old forest on flat areas), VC4 (>15-yr-old forest on hills). Stem density decreased with stand age and was lowest in VC3, while height, basal area and species density increased with age and were higher in older than in younger forests. Topographic position also influenced forest structure and composition. Basal area and height were largely determined by stand age, whereas stem and species density, and composition were influenced mostly by soil variables associated with fertility, and by spatial autocorrelation. Adults and saplings showed contrasting patterns and correlates of community structure, but similar patterns and correlates of composition, possibly due to the prevalence of coppicing. Our results show that our sampling approach can overcome several limitations of chronosequence studies, and provide insights in the patterns and drivers of succession, as well as guidelines for forest management and conservation.

AB Suppression of tree seedlings by the understory is an important ecological filter with implications for tree diversity and dynamics. In a greenhouse competition experiment, we used seedlings of four canopy species from coastal dune forest (Diospyros natalensis, Euclea racemosa, Sideroxylon inerme and Apodytes dimidiata) to examine the relative competitive effects of the dominant understory herb Isoglossa woodii on seedling performance. We manipulated I. woodii density, light and nutrient levels and measured growth responses. Total seedling biomass decreased with density of I. woodii. The magnitude of biomass suppression with competitor density was similar among tree species. Consequently there was no discernable hierarchy of competitive ranking among tree species. The relative growth rate of seedlings decreased at higher densities of I. woodii and increased at higher nutrient levels but was unaffected by variation in light conditions. Aboveground biomass decreased at higher densities of I. woodii and at higher light levels but increased at higher nutrient levels. Size asymmetric competition for light and nutrients may be the major driver of aboveground interactions between tree seedling and I. woodii. While tree species showed no hierarchy of competitive ability their seedlings exhibited equivalent responses to competition from an understory dominant, permitting species coexistence and the maintenance of species diversity.

AB Antagonistic interactions between host plants and mistletoes often form complex networks of interacting species. Adequate characterization of network organization requires a combination of qualitative and quantitative data. Therefore, we assessed the distribution of interactions between mistletoes and hosts in the Brazilian Pantanal and characterized the network structure in relation to nestedness and modularity. Interactions were highly asymmetric, with mistletoes presenting low host specificity (i.e., weak dependence) and with hosts being highly susceptible to mistletoe-specific infections. We found a non-nested and modular pattern of interactions, wherein each mistletoe species interacted with a particular set of host species. Psittacanthus spp. infected more species and individuals and also caused a high number of infections per individual, whereas the other mistletoes showed a more specialized pattern of infection. For this reason, Psittacanthus spp. were regarded as module hubs while the other mistletoe species showed a peripheral role. We hypothesize that this pattern is primarily the result of different seed dispersal systems. Although all mistletoe species in our study are bird dispersed, the frugivorous assemblage of Psittacanthus spp. is composed of a larger suite of birds, whereas Phoradendron are mainly dispersed by Euphonia species. The larger assemblage of bird species dispersing Psittacanthus seeds may also increase the number of hosts colonized and, consequently, its dominance in the study area. Nevertheless, other restrictions on the interactions among species, such as the differential capacity of mistletoe infections, defense strategies of hosts and habitat types, can also generate or enhance the observed pattern.

AB In Costa Rica, dioecious Carica papaya has been observed growing in disturbed areas and within secondary lowland forests. Such populations can serve as a reservoir of genetic and morphological diversity for this tropical fruit crop. We quantify the levels and patterns of the diversity of naturally occurring populations of C. papaya and address the demographic history of these populations. We measured 29 vegetative and reproductive morphological traits in situ from 252 plants and found significant heterogeneity among regional populations in the majority of these traits. Significant variation was found among regional populations with respect to fruit size and shape, with plants in the Nicoya Peninsula possessing smaller, less fleshy fruit, a characteristic of previously described wild populations of papaya. We then assessed the levels and patterns of genetic diversity in 164 plants from natural populations and 20 cultivars. Natural populations exhibit a deficiency of heterozygotes; however, this is much more pronounced within the cultivars. Although there is little genetic differentiation among natural populations, we did find evidence of cryptic genetic population structure. Analyses of population demography indicate that these natural populations have undergone a recent genetic bottleneck, followed by recent population expansion, possibly promoted by the transformation of the Costa Rican landscape for agricultural use.

AB This paper examines the feasibility of applying self-thinning concepts to savannas and how competition with herbaceous vegetation may modify self-thinning patterns among woody plants in these ecosystems. Competition among woody plants has seldom been invoked as a major explanation for the persistence of herbaceous vegetation in mixed treegrass ecosystems. On the contrary, the primary resource-based explanations for treegrass coexistence are based on treegrass competition (niche-separation) that assumes that trees are inferior competitors unless deeper rooting depths provide them exclusive access to water. Alternative nonresource-based hypotheses postulate that trees are the better competitors, but that tree populations are suppressed by mortality related to fire, herbivores, and other disturbances. If self-thinning of woody plants can be detected in savannas, stronger evidence for resource-limitation and competitive interactions among woody plants would suggest that the primary models of savannas need to be adjusted. We present data from savanna sites in South Africa to suggest that self-thinning among woody plants can be detected in low-disturbance situations, while also showing signs that juvenile trees, more so than adults, are suppressed when growing with herbaceous vegetation in these ecosystems. This finding we suggest is evidence for size-asymmetric competition in savannas.

AB This study explores whether differences in germination ability shape habitat distributions among closely related epiphytic species, particularly in the context of the ability to colonize disturbed habitats. We compared the germination of three epiphytic bromeliad species differing in their ability to colonize secondary arboreal vegetation in natural forests, and in old and young coffee plantations. We asked if germination is related to their distribution within the canopy and between habitats, and the extent to which the substrate (branch) or microclimate affects germination success. Tillandsia viridiflora, a species that is largely restricted to closed forests, had highest germination success in natural forests, Tillandsia juncea, a pioneer species, germinated best in young coffee plantations, and Tillandsia heterophylla, an intermediate species, equally in forests and young plantations. Surprisingly germination rates of all three species were lowest in old plantations. Bryophyte cover on branches had a positive effect on germination of T. viridiflora and T. heterophylla, but T. juncea germination rates were largely independent of climate and substrate. These results show that germination can limit the ability of species to colonize disturbed habitats and also contributes to within-canopy distribution.

AB Experimental approaches to study seed dispersal of the Brazil nut tree have hitherto relied on exposed seeds deposited on the forest floor. Here we use a new method to study the natural dispersal by large rodents such as agoutis; tracking experimentally manipulated and tagged fruits containing individually marked seeds. Fruit manipulation did not deter agoutis from handling fruits. We found that agoutis usually moved intact fruits away from their original location below the parent tree before either hiding them or gnawing through the pericarp to access the seeds inside. Most fruits were moved to distances of 1530 m from their original position, but some fruits could be taken as far as 60 m. A large number of seeds extracted from manipulated fruits appeared to be eaten immediately. Only 27 out of 1740 experimental seeds were found buried in shallow caches, generally within 5 m of the opened fruit. Fruit removal distance accounted for a disproportionate amount of total seed movement and seeds in the current study were dispersed significantly farther than in a previous experiment using exposed seeds, suggesting that classic dispersal experiments of this character may severely underestimate seed dispersal distances. We therefore conclude that the new method provides a more realistic and accurate approach to investigate natural seed dispersal of Brazil nuts and that the removal of fruits from underneath parent trees before being opened is the key to the significantly increased distances at which seeds are dispersed.

AB Species composition, number of emerging seedlings, species diversity and functional group of the soil seed banks, and the influence of grazing on the similarity between the soil seed banks and aboveground vegetation, were studied in 2008 and 2009 in a semi-arid savanna of Ethiopia. We tested whether the availability of persistent seeds in the soil could drive the transition from a degraded system under heavy grazing to healthy vegetation with ample perennial grasses. A total of 77 species emerged from the soil seed bank samples: 21 annual grasses, 12 perennial grasses, 4 herbaceous legumes, 39 forbs, and 1 woody species. Perennial grass species dominated the lightly grazed sites, whereas the heavily grazed sites were dominated by annual forbs. Heavy grazing reduced the number of seeds that can germinate in the seed bank. Species richness in the seed bank was, however, not affected by grazing. With increasing soil depth, the seed density and its species richness declined. There was a higher similarity in species composition between the soil seed bank and aboveground vegetation at the lightly grazed sites compared with the heavily grazed sites. The mean similarity between the seed banks and aboveground vegetation was relatively low, indicating the effect of heavy grazing. Moreover, seeds of perennial grasses were less abundant in the soil seed banks under heavy grazing. We concluded that restoration of grass and woody species from the soil seed banks in the heavily grazed areas could not be successful in semi-arid savannas of Ethiopia.

AB The elimination of the largest herbivores (elephants and rhinoceroses) from many forests in tropical East Asia may have severe consequences for plant species that depend on them for seed dispersal. We assessed the capacity of Malayan tapirs Tapirus indicusthe next largest nonruminant herbivore in the regionas a substitute for the lost megafauna in this role by studying their ability to disperse the seeds of nine fleshy-fruited plants with seeds 597 mm in length. We combined information from feeding trials, germination tests, and field telemetry to assess the effect of tapir consumption on seed viability and to estimate how far the seeds would be dispersed. The tapirs (N=8) ingested few seeds. Seed survival through gut passage was moderately high for small-seeded plants (e.g., 36.9% for Dillenia indica) but very low for medium- (e.g., 7.6% for Tamarindus indica) and large-seeded (e.g., 2.8% for Artocarpus integer) plants. Mean seed gut passage times were long (63236 h) and only the smallest seeds germinated afterwards. Using movement data from four wild tapirs in Peninsular Malaysia we estimated mean dispersal distances of 9171287 m (range=223289 m) for small-seeded plants. Malayan tapirs effectively dispersed small-seeded plants but acted as seed predators for the large-seeded plants included in our study, suggesting that they cannot replace larger herbivores in seed dispersal. With the absence of elephants and rhinos many megafaunal-syndrome plants in tropical East Asia are expected to face severe dispersal limitation problems.

AB The consequences of habitat alteration on the role of understory insectivorous birds as predators of herbivorous insects in tropical forests are poorly understood. To examine whether fragmentation may affect the topdown controls of herbivory, we compared the number of species, individuals, and the community structure of insectivorous birds between fragments and continuous tropical moist forest in Mexico. We also registered insect herbivore abundances and conducted a larvae predation experiment to evaluate the potential role of insectivorous birds as predators of herbivorous insects. We recorded 63 bird species from 22 families, 43 percent of which were insectivorous birds. Species richness, abundance, and diversity of the avian community were higher in continuous forest compared with forest fragments. For insectivorous birds in particular, there was low similarity in avian insectivore communities between forest types, and forest fragments had more heavily dominated communities of avian insectivores. During the dry season, forest fragments presented significantly higher predation rates on artificial caterpillars, and lower abundance of herbivorous Lepidoptera larvae, compared with continuous forest. Furthermore, there was a significant negative correlation between artificial caterpillar predation rate and larval Lepidoptera abundance, with higher rates of predation in sample sites of low Lepidoptera abundance. Hence, the potentially greater light in the dry season combined with a more dominated avian insectivore community in forest fragments may facilitate increased predation by avian insectivores, resulting in a decline in abundance of larval Lepidoptera, with implications for the process of insect-driven herbivory in forest fragments.

AB Large-seeded plants are especially vulnerable to the loss of seed dispersers in small forest fragments. The palm Attalea humilis goes against this trend by reaching high abundances in small remnants. Productivity, seed dispersal and seed predation of A. humilis were investigated in two large (2400 and 3500 ha) and three small (19, 26 and 57 ha) Atlantic Forest fragments in southeastern Brazil. Palms in the small fragments produced more female inflorescences, resulting in a higher fruit production in these places. Seed dispersal rates were higher in the large fragments, where scatter hoarding was more frequent. Scolytine beetles were the main seed predators and damaged a larger number of seeds in small fragments, but predation by rodents and bruchine beetles was low irrespective of fragment size. As scolytines do not necessarily kill the seeds, low predation by bruchines and rodents, together with its own high productivity, allow A. humilis to be more abundant in small fragments despite the scarcity of its main dispersers. This increased abundance, by its turn, can increase competitive interactions between A. humilis and other plants in small fragments. Thus, abundance patterns of A. humilis are a good example of fragmentation affecting the balance of ecological interactions in a complex way, emphasizing the role of preserving ecological processes for conserving biodiversity in fragmented tropical landscapes.

AB The Neotropical ant Pseudomyrmex triplarinus is involved in an obligate and complex symbiotic association with Triplaris americana trees. The ants inhabit trunk and branch domatia and respond aggressively to foreign invaders. Their degree of host specificity and basis for recognition of host trees has not been studied. We determined that, in contrast to T. americana seedlings, heterospecific seedlings set around the host trees suffered continuous pruning. Ants also removed 80100 percent of heterospecific leaves attached to the trunk in contrast to only 1030 percent of conspecific leaves. True species specificity was demonstrated by the selective removal of leaves from Triplaris poeppigiana pinned to host trees. This selectivity was also observed in a matrix-independent bioassay using leaf cuticular extracts on glass microfiber strips. Strips treated with leaf wax extracts from host trees and pinned to the trunk of host trees received only 42 percent of the number of ant visits recorded on solvent-treated controls by the end of the experiment. Strips treated with extracts of a related species, T. poeppigiana, received 64 percent of the number of ant visits compared with solvent-treated controls. These experiments also suggest that P. triplarinus recognizes surface chemicals of their host tree, independent of the texture or architecture of the carrier material; although these factors may still play some role in recognition. This is the first study that we are aware of to investigate the mechanism of host discrimination related to pruning behavior.

AB Ants are a dominant group in tropical savannas and here we examined the responses of the arboreal and ground-dwelling ant fauna to a fire in a Neotropical savanna (cerrado) reserve in Central Brazil. Ants were collected using pitfall traps and baits placed in trees and on the ground beneath each tree. Of the 36 trees marked along two transects, half (from each transect) were burned and half not. The same trees were sampled 1 wk before and again 3 and 12 mo after the fire. Rarefaction curves and ordination analyses using data from all trees from each side of each transect indicated that overall ant species richness and composition did not change after fire. Fire, however, reduced the mean number of ant species per tree, and increased the mean number of species on the ground. Fire increased the average abundance of specialist predators, Camponotini, and opportunistic species, and decreased that of arboreal specialists. Changes in the ground-dwelling fauna were only detected 12 mo after the fire, while those in the arboreal fauna occurred earlier and were no longer apparent 12 mo after the fire. We suggest that these contrasting results represent mainly an indirect response of the ant communities to fire-induced changes in vegetation. Given the temporary and small scale nature of the effects detected and the overall resilience of the ant fauna, our results indicate that a single fire in the cerrado vegetation does not greatly impact the structure of ant communities in the short term.

AB We investigated the mechanism of coexistence of the rare Amani Sunbird (Hedydipna pallidigastra) and the widespread Collared Sunbird (H. collaris), within Brachystegia woodland in the Arabuko-Sokoke Forest, Kenya. We compared how prey abundance and search strategies affect resource exploitation by the two species. We used foraging theory to direct our measures of feeding activities as influenced by sunbird species, tree species and foraging height. We evaluated invertebrate abundance among tree species at different heights within trees. The Collared Sunbird primarily used the understory, and the Amani Sunbird primarily used the upper-canopy. Overall, the rate of prey attacks per flight of the Amani Sunbird was 2.8 times greater than that of the Collared Sunbird. The Amani Sunbird, however, used increased search and attack rates in the understory compared with the mid- and upper-canopies, but the Collared Sunbird foraged similarly throughout all strata. We hypothesize that the increased foraging rate of the Amani in the understory reflects increased foraging costs due to interference from the Collared Sunbird in that stratum. Furthermore, the Collared Sunbird exploits rich patches by moving frequently from place to place. The Amani Sunbird forages slowly, with reduced travel rates, and with a greater number of prey captures within a patch. Arthropod density did not differ among the vegetative strata, but was higher in Brachystegia spiciformis and Hymenaea verrucosa than in six other tree species. We hypothesize that the Amani Sunbird appears dependent upon continued tall B. spiciformis trees within the canopy of the Arabuko-Sokoke Forest.

We compared the amount of nectar after 712 removals with the accumulated nectar in non-manipulated flowers after 12 h. In all, but one species, removals increased volume by 1.54.6 times and sugar content by 1.64 times, which may affect flower visitation by bats, pollen flow, and reproduction.

AB Although the use of mineral licks by diverse Amazonian birds and mammals is well-known, the ultimate motivation for such behavior remains unclear. As aerosol deposition of salts declines with distance from oceanic sources, lick visitation in the western Amazon can be explained by demand for sodium, given the low concentration of this micronutrient in the plant tissues consumed by these taxa. Sodium limitation also influences ant foraging behavior, and impinges on ecosystem rates of carbon cycling. The biogeographical context of sodium availability has been largely overlooked, but has substantial pantropical implications for herbivore and decomposer performance in inland rain forests.

AB Different disturbances in similar habitats can produce unique successional assemblages of plants. We collected plant species composition and cover data to investigate the effects of three common types of disturbancesfire, anthropogenic clearing (cleared), and clearing followed by goat grazing (cleared-and-grazed)on early-successional coppice (dry forest) community structure and development on Eleuthera, Bahamas. For each disturbance type, both the ground layer (<0.5 m height) and shrub layer (>0.5 m height) were sampled in eight patches (>1 ha) of varying age (128 yr) since large-scale mature coppice disturbance. Overall, plant communities differed among disturbance types; several common species had significantly higher cover in the shrub layer of fire patches, and cleared-and-grazed patches exhibited higher woody ground cover. Total percent cover in the shrub layer increased in a similar linear fashion along the investigated chronosequence of each disturbance type; however, cover of the common tree species, Bursera simaruba, increased at a notably slower rate in cleared-and-grazed patches. The pattern of increase and subsequent decrease in cover of Lantana spp. and Zanthoxylum fagara in the shrub layer was characterized by longer persistence and higher covers, respectively, in cleared-and-grazed patches, which also exhibited low peak cover and fast decline of nonwoody ground cover. Our results suggest that goats may accelerate some aspects of succession (e.g., quickly removing nonwoody ground cover) and retard other aspects (e.g., inhibiting growth of tree species and maintaining early-successional shrubs in the shrub layer). These effects may lead to different successional trajectories, and have important conservation implications.

AB As climbing plants lack the capacity to hold themselves upright, they need to encounter a suitable host. Vines, lianas, and secondary hemiepiphytes need, therefore, an effective searching strategy. Various hypotheses have been put forward on searching strategies, including skototropismgrowth toward darknessand random searching. We studied host searching strategies of three secondary hemiepiphyte species belonging to the genus Heteropsis. We recorded information on the diameter distribution of host and evaluated whether these hosts were suitable, i.e., sufficiently tall for Heteropsis individuals to reach reproductive size. The diameter distribution of host trees bearing Heteropsis seedlings was similar to that of the trees in our study plots. Also, we found that 7281 percent of the Heteropsis seedlings were present on unsuitable hosts (seedlings, saplings, herbs). These results suggest that Heteropsis seedlings search hosts in a random manner and not by skototropism. We found quite a distinct pattern for adult Heteropsis individuals, which predominantly occur on host trees bigger than 10 cm dbh. Host diameter distribution for Heteropsis adults differed significantly from that of the entire tree community. This difference suggests that Heteropsis individuals may change hosts if they are initially present on nonsuitable hosts. We observed that Heteropsis seedlings and juveniles on unsuitable hosts often produced vegetative shoots that searched for another host. In many cases, such shoots did not find a suitable host. For Heteropsis, our results suggest that host tree searching is a long-term trial and error process that is governed by a random searching strategy.

AB Most mistletoe species that live in savanna patches are subjected to frequent fires. Although having similar habits, even congener species may parasitize very different host species and show different degrees of specialization that may differentially affect their resistance to fire. We studied three congener mistletoe species with a diverse degree of specificity to their hosts: Psittacanthus biternatus, Psittacanthus eucalyptifolius and Psittacanthus plagiophyllus, the first being the most generalist species, and the last the most specialist. We investigated their prevalence (proportion of hosts infected) in 35 plots of an Amazonian savanna, with different fire histories. Our aim was to understand if they respond similarly to fire frequency and the abundance of their hosts. Additionally, we experimentally applied fire to individuals of the three species using a portable propane flamethrower to test for the influence of mistletoe species, plant size and quantity of heat pulses (single or double burn) on mistletoe survivorship. Prevalence varied greatly among species: 1.5 percent for P. biternatus, 4.8 percent for P. eucalyptifolius and 20 percent for P. plagiophyllus. Prevalence of P. plagiophyllus was negatively related to fire frequency, while for the other two species it was not. Psittacanthus biternatus had a higher probability of survival compared with the other two species, and larger plants were more likely to survive under single burn treatment and to regenerate through sprouting. Our results suggest that, due to complex interactions between fire, hosts and mistletoes, even sympatric species may respond differently to fire frequency and host abundance.

AB Many plant species have the capacity to regenerate asexually by resprouting from stem and leaf fragments. In the pan-tropical shrub genus Piper, this tendency is thought to be higher in shade-tolerant than light-demanding species, and to represent a trade-off with annual seed production. Here we use molecular markers to identify clones in five Piper species varying in light requirements. We test predictions that (i) asexual recruitment success is highest in shade-tolerant species, and (ii) that consequently, shade-tolerant species are characterized by lower genotypic diversity than light-demanding Piper. We found that two shade-tolerant Piper species recruited asexually more frequently (3642% of sampled shoots were of asexual origin) than, two light-demanding and one shade-tolerant species (026%). Furthermore, as predicted, genotypic diversity was negatively correlated with the frequency of asexual recruitment in the population. Nonetheless, genotypic diversity of Piper was high compared with other clonal plants. The proportion of unique genotypes found per population ranged from 0.58 to 1.0 and the genotypic Simpson's diversity ranged from 0.93 to 1.0 for all five species. Our results suggest that even though asexual reproduction plays an important role in maintaining local populations of Piper in the understory, it does not seem to reduce genotypic diversity to levels that will threaten these species ability to respond to environmental change.

AB We compiled herbarium specimen data to provide an improved characterization of geographic patterns of diversity using indices of species diversity and floristic similarity based on rarefaction principles. A dataset of 3650 georeferenced plant specimens belonging to Orchidaceae and Rubiaceae endemic to Atlantic Central Africa was assembled to assess species composition per half-degree or one-degree grid cells. Local diversity was measured by the expected number of species (S(k)) per grid cell found in subsamples of increasing size and compared with raw species richness (S(R)). A nearly unbiased estimator of the effective number of species per grid cell was also used, allowing quantification of ratios of true diversity between grid cells. Species turnover was measured using a presence/absence-based similarity index (S phi rensen) and an abundance-based index that corrects for sampling bias (NNESS). Our results confirm that the coastal region of Cameroon is more diverse in endemic species than those more inland. The southern part of this coastal forest is, however, as diverse as the more intensively inventoried northern part, and should also be recognized as an important center of endemism. A strong congruence between S phi rensen and NNESS similarity matrices lead to similar delimitations of floristic units. Hence, heterogeneous sampling seems to confer more bias when measuring patterns of local diversity using raw species richness than species turnover using S phi rensen index. Overall, we argue that subsampling methods represent a useful way to assess diversity gradients using herbarium specimens while correcting for heterogeneous sampling effort.

AB The interaction of plants with insect herbivores and fungal pathogens can affect community dynamics, but there is little information on how this antagonistic interaction may be altered in human-disturbed tropical systems. We examined whether the amount and quality of foliar damage on the pioneer herbs Heliconia latispatha and Heliconia collinsiana are distinct on road edges and secondary riparian vegetation compared with natural gaps in continuous forest (controls) in Mexico. We also investigated some physical and biological mechanisms that may jointly explain such differences. The overall insect damage in H. latispatha was similar between road edges and natural forest gaps (8.0% vs. 7.2% of leaf area). Damage by caterpillars, however, decreased from 4.2 percent in forest gaps to 0.5 percent on road edges, whereas damage by leaf-cutting ants increased from 0 to 5.8 percent. In secondary riparian vegetation, where none of the leaves sampled were attacked by ants, overall herbivore damage in H. collinsiana was less than half that observed in forest gaps (3.0% vs. 6.7%), and driven mainly by differences in caterpillar damage (2.5% vs. 6.2%). By contrast, attack by leaf fungal pathogens was two to three times greater in both human-disturbed habitats than in gaps (8.29.6% vs. 3.74.2%). Potential mechanisms underlying these differences involved human-induced shifts in air and soil temperature driven by greater light availability, as well as changes in relative humidity, leaf toughness, foliar condensed tannins, and local abundance of herbivores. Our results indicate that human disturbance alters insect herbivory and may increase proliferation of leaf disease.

AB Manipulations of herbivores in protected areas may have profound effects on ecosystems. We examine short-term effects on tree species assemblages and resource utilization by a mesoherbivore and small-size herbivores (ungulates <20 kg) in Sand Forest, after browsing release from a megaherbivore (elephant), or both a mega- and mesoherbivore (nyala), respectively. Effects were experimentally separated using replicated exclosures where all trees were counted, identified to species and browsing events recorded. Tree species assemblages were impacted by both elephant and nyala, and by each herbivore species individually. Tree turnover rates were higher where both herbivore species were present than in their combined absence. Diet was segregated among elephant, nyala and small-size herbivores. Both resource specificity and browsing pressure by nyala increased in absence of elephant; small-size herbivores increased resource specificity in absence of elephant, and increased browsing pressure in absence of both elephant and nyala. This implies interference competition with competitive release. The indirect effect of the manipulation of herbivore populations, through the removal of one or two herbivore species, caused a shift in tree species composition and diet of smaller-size herbivores. These indirect effects, especially on tree species composition, can become critical as they affect vegetation dynamics, biodiversity and ecosystem processes. Therefore, in order to conserve habitats and biodiversity across all trophic levels, conservation managers should consider the effects of: (1) the full herbivore assemblage present; and (2) any effects of altering the relative and absolute abundance of different herbivore species on other herbivore species and vegetation.

AB The canopies of tropical rain forests support highly diverse, yet poorly known, animal and plant communities. It is vital that researchers who invest the time needed to gain access to the high canopy are able efficiently to survey the animals and plants that they find there. Here, we develop diversity assessment protocols for one of the most ecologically important canopy animal groups, the ants, in lowland dipterocarp rain forest in Sabah, Malaysia. We design and test a novel trap (the purse-string trap) that can be remotely collected, thus avoiding disturbance to ants. We compare this modified trap with two other methods for surveying canopy ants: precision insecticide fogging and baited pitfall trapping. In total, we collected 39,351 ants belonging to 173 species in 38 genera. Fogging collected the most individuals and species, followed by purse-string trapping with baited pitfall trapping catching the fewest. Fogging also resulted in samples with a different species composition to purse-string trapping and baited pitfall trapping, which were not different from one another. Using a greedy algorithm, which guides the selection of inventory methods in order to maximize new species discovered per researcher-hour, we show that projects allocating fewer than 132 researcher-hours to canopy ant collection and identification should sample exclusively using fogging. Those with more time should use a combination of methods. This prioritization technique could be used to accelerate species discovery in future rapid biodiversity assessments.

AB Warmer, and sometimes drier, conditions associated with global climate change are driving many species to shift poleward and/or upslope. I hypothesized that microclimatic changes related to deforestation cause similar shifts for forest species persisting within degraded landscapes. This appears to be the first study to examine this novel hypothesis. I examined elevational distributions of dung beetle communities along parallel intact and disturbed elevational gradients from 290 to 3450 m asl in the Andes of southeastern Peru. Deforested sites were consistently warmer and drier than forested sites. To maintain the same ambient temperature as in forest, species in a deforested landscape would need to shift on average 489 +/- 59 m upslope. Dung beetle species showed a mean upslope range shift of 132 +/- 64 m (maximum=743 m) in the deforested landscape. Eight species occurred farther upslope in the degraded landscape, while none shifted downslope. In addition to upper range limit expansions, six species shifting upslope also showed range contractions or population declines at their lower range boundary. High elevation and disturbance-tolerant species did not show range shifts. These findings suggest that land-use change may both confound and compound the influence of global climate change on biodiversity. Synergies between habitat degradation and climate change could more than double previous range shift projections for this century, leading to unexpectedly rapid changes in biodiversity, especially for sensitive organisms such as tropical insects. On the other hand, range shifts caused by habitat degradation may be mistakenly attributed to global climate change.

AB Although multiple hypotheses have been proposed to explain group formation, few fully explain the diversity of social interactions found in foliage-roosting bats. Among these bats, tent-roosting species are capable of constructing their own shelters. Although many bats utilize tents previously constructed by other species, it has been suggested that a particular subset of tent-roosting bats specialize on making tents from particular plant species. Tents provide protection from weather and often a place to roost close to foraging sites. Moreover, tent lifespan is plant species specific and may last from a few weeks to more than a year. To better understand effects that roosts have on social bonds of tent-roosting bats, we conducted a literature review to collect information on social systems and tent lifespan. We tested correlated evolution of group stability and group longevity with tent lifespan using Pagel's method for discrete characters. We found that group stability and group longevity are correlated with tent lifespan. That there is correlated evolution between these characters contributes to our understanding of how different mechanisms interact to produce a variety of social systems in mammals.

AB The northeast area of Sao Paulo state has been intensively deforested, resulting in a highly fragmented landscape composed of a few large patches and several small patches of natural vegetation surrounded by sugarcane, eucalyptus, and citrus plantations. In this scenario, we investigated the puma (Puma concolor) population size, sex ratio, and relatedness in two of the last, and largest, natural refuges in the area using a noninvasive method during 2004 2008. By collecting and individualizing fecal samples by microsatellites, we identified 17 individuals, 13 females (76.4%) and 4 males (23.6%) in these areas. Five females were sampled in distinct years and over an extended time and probably represented resident adults. By investigating the relatedness among individual pumas inhabiting the area, we found that only three animals were not related to each other. We also found evidence that young females might establish an adjacent or overlapping territory to their mothers (phylopatry). Moreover, we registered 11 road-killed individuals nearby the study area, ten males and one female, and six humanpuma conflicts. The study area may act as a source of individuals that disperse across the matrix to occupy new home ranges, maintaining some degree of gene flow in a sourcesink metapopulation structure. Finally, we recommend that puma management should be conducted at the landscape level to provide effective puma conservation in northeastern Sao Paulo state.

AB Forest fragmentation can lead to reductions in food availability, especially for some large-bodied tropical mammals such as spider monkeys. During a 15\xE2\x80\x90mo period, we assessed the diet of Geoffroyi's spider monkey (Ateles geoffroyi) in continuous forest and fragments in the Lacandona region, southern Mexico, and related differences in diet to differences in vegetation structure and composition. We found that both forest types presented top food species for monkeys (e.g., Spondias spp., Brosimum alicastrum), but the sum of the importance value index of these species and the density of large trees were lower in fragments than in continuous forest. We also found that, compared with continuous forest, monkeys in fragments diversified their overall diet, increased consumption of leaves, and reduced the time they spent feeding on trees in favor of more time feeding on hemiepiphytes (particularly Ficus spp.) and palms, both of which were common in fragments. We attribute these changes to the relative food scarcity of the most favored feeding plants in forest fragments. Overall, our findings suggest that monkeys are able to adjust their diet to food availability in fragments, and thus persist in small- and medium-sized fragments. Although it is unlikely that the small size of two of the three study fragments (14 and 31 ha) can maintain viable populations of monkeys in the long term, they may function as stepping stones, facilitating inter-fragment movements and ultimately enhancing seed dispersal in fragmented landscapes.

AB In nature, orchids are fully dependent on mycorrhizal fungi to germinate their seeds. These fungi can penetrate root cells and form pelotons, hyphal coils responsible for providing simple sugars for the orchid embryo. During the achlorophyllous seedling stage, orchids depend on fungi; and some species remain dependent through life, while others establish photosynthesis but, to varying degrees, remain facultatively dependent or responsive to fungal colonization as adults. The aim of this study was to identify how many clades of fungi can establish mycorrhizal associations with Coppensia doniana, a widespread orchid in Campos do Jordao (Brazil) and to demonstrate how morphological features can be useful to group and identify these fungi. Plants were collected during the dry season of 2009 near Campos do Jordao State Park. Fungi were isolated by transferring root segments containing pelotons to media. Three main clades of fungi were formed by either qualitative or quantitative morphological data. We identified these fungi as two morphotypes of Ceratorhiza (anamorphic stage of Ceratobasidium) and one uninucleate Rhizoctonia. The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequencing data corroborated the morphological features showing the same three clades; all isolates showed a high similarity with Ceratobasidium ITS sequences in GenBank. Thus, it was possible to demonstrate a high affinity between this orchid species of Oncidiinae and Ceratobasidium. Morphological data associated with multivariate statistics proved to be a useful tool in multilevel taxonomy of these orchid-associated fungi.

AB Spatial patterns of tropical deforestation and fragmentation are conditional upon human settlement characteristics. We analyze four different human occupation models (indigenous, colonist frontier, transition and established settlement) in the Colombian Guyana Shield at three different times: 1985, 1992 and 2002, and compared them for: (1) deforestation rates; (2) the amount of forest as classified according to a fragmentation pattern (interior forest, edge forest, perforated forest and forest patch); (3) various fragmentation metrics using repeated measures analysis of variance; and (4) potential future deforestation trends though the implementation of a spatially explicit simulation model. The indigenous and colonist frontier occupation models had low rates of deforestation (0.04%/yr), while the well-established settlement occupation model had the highest rate (3.68%/yr). Our results indicate that the four occupation models generate three deforestation patterns: diffuse, which can be subdivided into two subpatterns (indigenous and colonist), geometric (transition) and patchy (established settlement). The area with the established settlement model was highly fragmented, while in the transition occupation area, forest loss was gradual and linked to economic activities associated with the expansion of the agricultural frontier. The simulation of future trends revealed that indigenous and colonist areas had a constant, albeit small, loss of forest covers. The other models had a deforestation probability of 0.8 or more. Overall, our results highlight the need for new and urgent policies for reducing forest conversion that consider intraregional variability in human occupation linked to differences in land-use patterns.

AB Nonlinear regression is increasingly used to develop allometric equations for forest biomass estimation (i.e., as opposed to the traditional approach of log-transformation followed by linear regression). Most statistical software packages, however, assume additive errors by default, violating a key assumption of allometric theory and possibly producing spurious models. Here, we show that such models may bias stand-level biomass estimates by up to 100 percent in young forests, and we present an alternative nonlinear fitting approach that conforms with allometric theory.

AB Leaves and branches of mature trees, lianas, and gap species were warmed in an Amazonian forest for 4 mo to observe the effect of warming on photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, and transpiration. Electric resistance heaters increased air temperatures near the leaves by approximately 2 degrees C. Sunlit leaf temperatures increased by 2-3 degrees C on average, but during some periods leaf temperatures increased by >5 degrees C. Maximum photosynthesis (A(max)) decreased significantly in the warmed leaves vs. the control leaves over the 13-wk study period with an average decrease in A(max) of 1.4 mu mol/m(2)s (19% decrease from a mean A(max) of 7.2 mu mol/m(2)s) when measured at 30 degrees C and there were no signs of acclimation to higher temperatures within existing leaves. The decline in A(max) was likely due to irreversible temperature damage caused by very high leaf temperatures and not due to C-i limitation of carboxylation. Warming had a larger negative impact on A(max) in canopy level tree species than other tested functional groups such as lianas or gap species. Transpiration did not significantly increase in the warmed leaves compared with the control group. This study indicates that increased temperatures due to global warming could potentially decrease future tropical forest carbon uptake by a significant amount.

AB Old field secondary succession of tropical dry forests (TDFs) is poorly understood, particularly regarding the dynamics of seedlings, saplings, and sprouts (regenerative communities). We used chronosequence and dynamic approaches to: (1) document successional trajectories of regenerative communities during the first dozen years of regeneration in abandoned pastures at Chamela, Mexico; (2) test the usefulness of chronosequences to predict the dynamics of regenerative communities along time; and (3) assess the influence of surrounding forest matrix, stand density, and understory light availability (in the rainy season) as driving factors of such dynamics. More than 1000 plants and 95 species of shrubs and trees 10-100 cm tall were monitored between 2004 and 2007 in nine abandoned pastures (0-12 yr since abandonment) and two old-growth forest (OGF) sites; gain and loss rates of plants, species, and plant cover were obtained. Chronosequence predicted a rapid and asymptotic increase of plant density, species density, and plant cover toward the OGF values. Such prediction did not match with dynamic data that showed negative or neutral net community rates of change, independently of fallow age. Recruitment and species gain rates increased with the amount surrounding forest matrix. No other effect of the explored factors was detected. Strong rainfall shortenings could be responsible for the high loss and low gain rates of plants and species recorded in most sites. We highlight the critical role of supra-annual rainfall variability on the dynamics of TDF regenerative communities and the poor predictive value of chronosequences in forest systems subjected to strong environmental temporal variation.

AB Hurricanes are an important part of the natural disturbance regime of the Yucatan Peninsula with the potential to alter forest structure and composition, yet investigations of species-level responses to severe winds are limited in this region. The effect of a category 5 hurricane (Hurricane Dean, 21 August 2007) on dry tropical forests across the southern Yucatan was examined with respect to tree damage, mortality, and sprouting. Damage was assessed 9-11 mo following the hurricane in 92 (500 m(2)) plots stratified by wind speed and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) change classes over a 25,000 km 2 study area. We investigated the relative importance of biotic (i.e., species, size, and wood density) and abiotic (i.e., wind speed) factors to better explain patterns of damage. Overall mortality was low (3.9%), however, mortality of less common species (8.5%) was elevated more than fourfold above that of 28 common species (1.8%), indicating immediate selective consequences for community composition. Species varied in the degree and type of damage experienced, with susceptibility increasing with tree diameter and height. Wood density influenced damage patterns only in areas where a critical threshold in storm intensity was exceeded (wind speeds >= 210 km/h). Although overall, damage severity increased with wind speed, common coastal species were more resistant to damage than species distributed farther inland. Our findings suggest that selective pressure exerted by frequent hurricane disturbance has, and will, continue to impact the floristic composition of forests on the Yucata'n Peninsula, favoring certain wind-resistant species.

AB Vascular epiphytes represent a highly diverse element of tropical rain forests, but they depend strongly on the structure and taxonomic composition of their tree communities. For conservation planning, it is therefore critical to understand the effect of host tree characteristics on epiphyte species richness in natural and anthropogenically transformed vegetation. Our study compares the effect of human land-use on epiphyte diversity based on 220 study plots in a lowland rain forest and an Andean cloud forest in western Ecuador. We evaluate the relevance of host tree size and taxonomic identity for epiphyte species richness in contiguous primary forests, forest fragments, isolated remnant trees (IRTs), and secondary forests. At both study sites, epiphyte diversity was highest in primary forests, and it was lowest on IRTs and in secondary forests. Epiphyte species numbers of forest fragments were significantly reduced compared with the contiguous primary forest at the lowland study site, but not in the cloud forest area. Host tree size was a core predictor among secondary forests, but it had less significance within other habitat types. Taxonomic identity of the host trees also explained up to 61 percent of the variation in epiphyte diversity, especially for IRTs. The structural and taxonomic composition of the tree community in anthropogenically transformed habitat types proved to be fundamental to epiphyte diversity. This highlights the importance of deliberate selection of tree species for reforestation in conservation programs and the possible negative effects of selective logging in primary forests.

AB Light intensity and heterogeneity are some of the main environmental factors that differ between forest and savanna habitats, and plant species from these habitats form distinct functional types. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that not only differences in morphological and physiological traits but also phenotypic plasticity in response to light are involved in adaptation to forest and savanna habitats by investigating ecotypic differentiation between populations of Plathymenia reticulata (Leguminosae: Mimosoideae), a tree from the Brazilian Atlantic Forest and the Brazilian Cerrado (savanna). Seeds from four natural populations (one from each biome core area and two from ecotonal regions) were grown in a common garden with four light treatments. Fifteen morphological and physiological characteristics were evaluated until individuals reached 6 mo old. Comparisons among populations showed differences for seven traits in at least one light treatment. These differences pointed to local adaptation to different biomes. Populations showed different levels of phenotypic plasticity in response to light in seven traits. Higher plasticity was found either in the forest core population or ecotonal populations; lower values were found in the cerrado core population. Lower plasticity in the cerrado population emphasizes the stress resistant syndrome, as lower plasticity is probably advantageous in a habitat where a conservative resource use is crucial. Higher plasticity in forest individuals suggests higher ability in exploiting the light heterogeneity in this habitat. Also, higher plasticity in ecotonal populations can be important to ensure the maintenance of P. reticulata in these temporally and spatially dynamic areas.

AB Although many tropical savannas are highly influenced by humans, the patterns of biodiversity loss in these systems remain poorly understood. In particular, the biodiversity consequences of replacing native grasslands with exotic pastures have not been studied. Here we examine how the conversion of the native savanna grasslands affects dung beetle communities. Our study was conducted in 14 native (grassland: campo limpo), and 21 exotic (Urochloa spp. monoculture) pastures in Carrancas, Minas Gerais, Brazil. We collected 4996 dung beetle individuals from 66 species: 3139 individuals from 50 species in native pastures and 1857 individuals from 55 species in the exotic pastures. Exotic pastures had lower dung beetle richness, abundance and biomass than native pastures. Species composition between the two pasture types was significantly different and exotic pastures were dominated by few abundant species. Indicator species analysis detected 16 species indicators of native pastures and three of exotic pastures, according to relative abundance and frequency in each pasture system. Our results show that the conversion of native pastures to exotic pastures leads to a predictable loss of local species richness, increasing dominance and changes in species composition. These results highlight the importance of maintaining native pastures in the Cerrado agro-pastoral landscape.

AB There is a growing concern that the feeding habits of the African elephant, which include pushing over, uprooting and snapping trees, may have a negative impact on other herbivores. Browsed trees are known to respond by either increasing production (shoots and leaves) or defence (secondary compounds). It is not clear, however, what proportion of the browsed biomass can be made available at lower feeding heights after a tree is pushed over or snapped; thus, it is also unclear how the forage quality is affected. In a field survey in Kruger National Park, South Africa, 708 Mopane trees were measured over four elephant utilization categories: snapped trees, pushed-over trees, uprooted trees and control trees. The elephants' impact on the leaf biomass distribution was quantified, and the forage quality (Ca, P, K and Mg, N, digestibility and condensed tannin [CT] concentrations) were analyzed. Pushed-over and uprooted trees had the maximum leaf biomass at lower heights (<1 m), snapped trees at medium heights (1-2 m) and control trees at higher heights (>2 m). In all three utilization categories, the minimum leaf biomass was seven times higher than it was for control trees at a height of below 1m. Leaf nitrogen content increased in all three categories and was significantly higher in snapped trees. CT concentrations increased slightly in all trees that were utilized by elephants, especially on granitic soils in the dry season. The results provide the insight that elephants facilitate the redistribution and availability of browse and improve the quality, which may positively affect small browsing herbivores.

AB This study examines the seed dispersal spectrum of the tropical dry forests of Southern Ecuador, in an effort to contribute to the knowledge of the complex dynamics of tropical dry forests. Seed dispersal spectrum was described for a total number of 160 species. Relationships of dispersal syndromes with plant growth form and climatic seasonality were explored. For a subset of 97 species, we determined whether dispersal spectrum changes when species abundance, in addition to species number, is taken into account. The same subset was used to relate dispersal syndromes with the environmental conditions. Zoochorous species dominated in the studied community. When considering the individual abundance of each species, however, anemochory was the prevalent dispersal syndrome. We found a significant difference in the frequency of dispersal syndromes among plant growth forms, with epizoochory only occurring in shrub species. The dispersal spectrum was dependent on climatic seasonality. The largest proportion of anemochorous species fructified during the dry season, while zoochorous diaspores dominated during the rainy season. A fourth-corner analysis indicated that the seed dispersal spectrum of Southern Ecuador dry forests is controlled by environmental conditions such as annual precipitation, annual temperature range or topography. Our results suggest that spatio-temporal changes in the environmental conditions may affect important ecological processes for dispersal. Thus, the predominance of one syndrome or another may depend on the spatial variation of environmental conditions.

AB Epiphytes are conspicuous structural elements of tropical forest canopies. Individual tree crowns in lowland forests may support more than 30 ant species, yet we know little about the effects of epiphytes on ant diversity. We examined the composition of arboreal ant communities on Annona glabra trees and their interactions with the epiphytic orchid Caularthron bilamellatum in Panama. We surveyed the ants on 73 trees (45 with C. bilamellatum and 28 lacking epiphytes) and recorded their nest sites and behavioral dominance at baits. We found a total of 49 ant species (in 20 genera), ranging 1-9 species per tree. Trees with C. bilamellatum had higher average (+SD) ant species richness (4.2 + 2.28) than trees without epiphytes (2.7 + 1.21). Hollow pseudobulbs (PBs) of C. bilamellatum were used as nest sites by 32 ant species, but only 43 percent of suitable PBs were occupied. Ant species richness increased with PB abundance in trees, but nest sites did not appear to be a limiting resource on A. glabra. We detected no close association between ants and the orchid. We conclude that higher ant species richness in the presence of the orchid is due to bottom-up effects, especially the year-round supply of extrafloral nectar. The structure of ant communities on A. glabra partly reflects interference competition among behaviorally dominant species and stochastic factors, as observed in other forests.

AB The structural complexity of habitats and the distance from the dispersion source are considered important determinants of species diversity. The fractal dimensions of substrates are a strong alternative measure for quantifying the structural complexity. In this paper, we tested the hypothesis that structural complexity and distance from a dispersion source affect the density and diversity of macro-invertebrates on submersed macrophytes. To test this hypothesis, we used artificial substrates with different fractal dimensions, which were incubated at different distances from a dispersion source (a stand of macrophytes) in a Neotropical floodplain lake. The relationship between the structural complexity of macrophytes and the density and diversity of invertebrates attached to artificial substrates was positive and significant. On the other hand, distance from the dispersion source negatively affected both the density and diversity of the attached invertebrates. For Oligochaeta, however, there was a significant effect of structural complexity for the artificial plants positioned further away, but it was not significant in the plants positioned closer to the dispersion source. Thus, the effects of complexity depended on the distance from the dispersion source, at least for this specific group of macro-invertebrates. These results suggest that both structural complexity and distance from the dispersion source should be considered together to explain the diversity of invertebrates in river-floodplain systems. In addition, our results show that there is great potential for using fractal dimensions as a tool to quantify structural complexity in aquatic habitats, especially at the small spatial scales perceived by macro-invertebrates.

AB Understanding the ecology of modern and ancient forests can help clarify the evolution of forest dwelling mammals. It is first necessary, however, to elucidate the source and extent of stable isotope variation in forest taxa. Tapirs are of particular interest because they are model organisms for identifying forest environments due to their highly conservative diet and habitat preferences. Here, stable carbon and oxygen isotopic compositions of extant tapirs are quantified to test hypotheses regarding ontogenetic diet shifts, stable isotope variation at the population level, and relationships between stable isotopes and climatic variables. A population of extant tapirs (Tapirus bairdii) demonstrates low delta(13)C variation (similar to 2-3%) and increased delta(13)C values in late erupting teeth, indicating that juveniles consume (13)C deplete milk and/or browse in denser forests. Disparate delta(18)O values of late erupting teeth are instead reflecting seasonal variation. Extant tapir (T. bairdii, Tapirus pinchaque, Tapirus terrestris) delta(18)O values are constrained by climatic and geographic variables. Most notably, delta(18)O values of T. bairdii decrease with decreasing precipitation frequency. Tapirus terrestris is typically present in areas with greater precipitation than T. bairdii and delta(18)O values instead positively correlate with delta(13)C values. These data indicate that tapirs in wetter areas are getting a larger proportion of their water from leaves experiencing less evaporation in denser canopies, while T. bairdii is interpreted to increase its consumption of water via drinking when present in drier areas. An understanding of extant tapir stable isotope ecology improves ecological interpretations of these elusive mammals both today and in the past.

AB Tropical secondary forest and agroforestry systems have been identified as important refuges for the local species diversity of birds and other animal groups, but little is known about the importance of these systems for terrestrial herbs. In particular, few studies report how the conversion from tropical forest to technified cacao plantation affects the species richness and the community structure of herbs. We conducted surveys in 43 cacao plantations along the border of the Lore Lindu National Park in Central Sulawesi, ranging from agroforests to technified cacao, categorizing the plantations as rustic cacao, planted shade cacao, and technified cacao. We recorded 91 herb species. Of the 74 species determined to species level, 21 were also found in natural forests, while 53 were recorded only in agricultural habitats. Araceae was the most forest-dependent plant family while Asteraceae included the highest number of nonforest species. Overall, the presence of forest species was confined to moderately intensively managed rustic and planted shaded plantations. Distance from the forest, which has been identified as a crucial parameter for the diversity and composition of other taxa in cacao agroforests, only played a minimal role for herbs. Our study suggests that native forest herbs maybe more vulnerable to forest conversion than animal groups. The intensification of cacao plantation management increases the presence of weedy species to the detriment of native forest species.

AB Conservation initiatives that have worked well in temperate and developed regions have often been applied in the tropics but with only limited success. Part of this failure is due to top-down conservation planning that has been conducted without taking local socio-economic considerations into adequate account. Here, we argue that conservation approaches would benefit from a deeper understanding of human-nature interactions.

We tested the impacts of a conventional ichthyological collection in small forest streams and showed that fish assemblages recover after a few months. We highlight ecological traits and habitat characteristics that might exacerbate the impacts of repeated removal of fish in long-term investigations, and advocate for the use of a capture-release approach whenever possible.

AB Gradual changes in vegetation structure and composition are expected to result from continuous environmental change with increasing elevation on mountains. Hence, the occurrence of abrupt or discrete ecotones in vegetation patterns is intriguing and may suggest key controls on community assembly in montane forests. We review tropical montane forest (TMF) zonation patterns focusing on a case study from the Cordillera Central, Hispaniola where a striking discontinuity in forest composition occurs consistently at similar to 2000 m elevation, with cloud forest below and monodominant pine forest above. We propose that a discontinuity in climatic factors (temperature, humidity) associated with the trade-wind inversion (TWI) is the primary cause of this and other ecotones in TMFs that occur at a generally consistent elevation. Low humidity, fires and occasional frost above the TWI favor pine over cloud forest species. Fires in the high-elevation pine forest have repeatedly burned down to the ecotone boundary and extinguished in the cloud forest owing to its low flammability, reinforced by high humidity, cloud immersion and epiphytic bryophyte cover. Small-scale fire patterns along the ecotone are influenced by topography and where forest structure is impacted by hurricanes and landslides. Analogous patterns are observed worldwide in other TMFs where the TWI is important, high-elevation fires are frequent, and the flora contains frost-tolerant species (often of temperate lineage). The response of this and other TMFs to anthropogenic climate change is highly uncertain owing to potentially countervailing effects of different climatic phenomena, including warming temperatures and decreased frost; changes in the TWI, high-elevation drought or cloudiness; and increased frequency or intensity of hurricanes and El Nino-Southern Oscillation events.

AB Plant morphological and physiological traits affect the way plants tolerate environmental stresses and therefore play an important role in shaping species distribution patterns in relation to environmental gradients. Despite our growing knowledge on the role of functional traits in structuring plant communities, few studies have tested their importance at large scales in the wet tropics. Here, we describe the distribution patterns of the most important West African rain forest timber species along the regional rainfall gradient and relate them to their functional traits. We found that the distribution patterns of 25 out of the 31 studied species (80%) were significantly related to mean annual rainfall. Shade tolerance and drought resistance were identified as the main strategy axes of variation. Wood density and leaf deciduousness emerged as the best predictor traits of species position along the rainfall gradient, explaining respectively 32 and 15 percent of the variation. Species traits tended to show stronger relationships with estimated optimum annual rainfall for each species than to the extreme rainfall conditions where they occur. The significant role of rainfall in shaping timber species distribution and the strong relationships between species traits and rainfall indicate that changes in climate, especially declining rainfall, could have strong effects on species composition and abundance in these tropical forests.

AB Edge effects along tropical forest-pasture margins are thought to cause a shift toward early successional characteristics of the understory forest vegetation. We tested this idea by sampling vegetation at five forest sites in northeast Costa Rica each of which had edges that were established over 20 yr earlier. Four of these sites had been selectively logged. We sampled woody plants > 0.2 and <= 1.3 m height in 54 m(2) within 0.2 ha plots at edges (N = 14), and at 150 m (N = 11) and 300 m from edges (N = 9). Composition and diversity did not vary with edge distance. Abundance of tree regeneration, mainly of canopy and emergent species, increased at edges. Abundance of lianas and slow-growing tree species did not differ significantly across the sampling locations. Weighted mean wood density varied little, with a reduction at edges for canopy species. Palms were less abundant at edges, but not less species rich. At edges, these plant assemblages maintain many of the characteristics of forest interior vegetation, though the changes observed may indicate ongoing functional change. Degradation of forest-pasture edges is not a universal feature of tropical forest fragmentation, and forests with high rates of natural turnover might have a high capacity to maintain themselves within forest edges alongside pasture.

AB Canopy trees are largely responsible for the environmental heterogeneity in the understory of tropical and subtropical species-rich forests, which in turn may influence sapling community dynamics. We tested the effect of the specific identity of four cloud forest canopy trees on total solar radiation, canopy openness, soil moisture, litter depth, and soil temperature, as well as on the structure and dynamics of the sapling community growing beneath their canopies. We observed significant effects of the specific identity of canopy trees on most understory microenvironmental variables. Soil moisture was higher and canopy openness lower beneath Cornus disciflora. In turn, canopy openness and total solar radiation were higher beneath Oreopanax xalapensis, while the lowest soil moisture occurred beneath Quercus laurina. Moreover, Chiranthodendron pentadactylon was the only species having a positive effect on litter depth under its canopy. In spite of these between-species environmental differences, only C. pentadactylon had significant, negative effects on sapling density and species richness, which may be associated to low seed germination and seedling establishment due to an increased litter depth in its vicinity. The relevance of the specific identity of canopy trees for natural regeneration processes and species richness maintenance depends on its potential to differentially affect sapling dynamics through species-specific modifications of microenvironmental conditions.

AB Dioecy is a rare breeding system in flowering plants, but one that has evolved multiple times in different plant lineages. Dioecious species are commonly associated with several ecological traits, including woody habit, fleshy fruit, and small, inconspicuous flowers, although the significance of these correlations has been debated extensively. Monoecy is a breeding system that may lead to the evolution of dioecy, but ecological correlates of monoecious species have rarely been analyzed. We determined the diversity of breeding systems in the littoral forests of Madagascar and used multivariate methods to estimate which ecological traits have the strongest association with dioecy and are the best predictors of breeding systems. The Malagasy littoral forest flora is a well-documented subset of the Malagasy flora, with 13 percent of total species diversity in an area < 1 percent of the island's total. We found high levels of dioecy (18.4%) and monoecy (9.2%), similar to incidences in other tropical floras. Using multinomial logistic regression, dioecy has the strongest association with woody habit and fleshy fruit. Monoecious species have a strong association with small flowers, although this association does not hold at higher taxonomic levels. Using classification and regression tree (CART) methods, the best predictors of dioecy are woody habit and fleshy fruit; monoecy is equally predicted by fleshy and dry fruit. For the Malagasy littoral forest, both methods provide further support for the importance of woody habit and fleshy fruit in the evolution of dioecy.

   INTERCEPTION
AB Recent work on bryophyte diversity in lowland forests of northern South America has suggested the existence of a new type of cloud forest, the 'tropical lowland cloud forest' (LCF). LCF occurs in river valleys in hilly areas with high air humidity and morning fog, and is rich in epiphytes. We explored epiphyte abundance and canopy microclimate of LCF in a lowland area (200-400 m asl) near Saul, central French Guiana. We analyzed the vertical distribution of epiphytic cover and biomass on 48 trees, in LCF and in lowland rain forest (LRF) without fog. Trees in LCF had significantly more epiphytic biomass than in LRF; mean total epiphytic biomass in LCF was about 59 g/m(2), and 35 g/m(2) in LRF. In all height zones on the trees, total epiphyte cover in LCF exceeded that in LRF, with ca 70 percent mean cover in LCF and ca 15 percent in LRF. During both wet and dry seasons, mean diurnal relative air humidity (RH) was higher in LCF than in LRF, and persistence of high RH after sunrise significantly longer in LCF. We suggest that the prolonged availability of high air humidity in LCF and the additional input of liquid water through fog, enhance epiphyte growth in LCF by shortening the desiccation period and lengthening the period of photosynthetic activity of the plants.

AB Tropical forests are highly threatened by human activities, even within the protected areas that have been established to conserve biodiversity. Human activities may have different degrees of impact on vegetation structure, composition and diversity. Some studies have measured direct evidence of human activities in forming disturbance gradients, while others have quantified canopy cover as a proxy for disturbance. When measurement is confined to human activities, disturbance may be underestimated in areas of poor canopy cover where forest degrading activities have ceased. Where measurements are restricted to canopy cover, disturbance may be underestimated in areas of extensive canopy cover that may have been subject to past disturbances, and overestimated for areas where canopy cover is naturally sparse. Combining indicators of past and present disturbances is therefore necessary to examine the full spectrum of human disturbances. Forest vegetation in Popa Mountain Park, Myanmar was surveyed and classified into three levels of disturbance-undisturbed, medium disturbed and highly disturbed-derived from evidence of cutting and canopy cover. The forests are second or third growth after clearing for agriculture in the early 20th century. All trees with >= 10 cm diameter at breast height in 168 sample plots (10 m x 10 m) were identified and measured. Density, basal area and diversity decreased and dominance rose when disturbance increased. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) clearly discriminated three forest stands and CCA axes were significantly correlated to soil moisture, soil nitrogen, elevation, slope, aspect, distance from park boundary and distance from villages.

AB This study assessed the hypothesis that plant life history traits determine the incidence of fungal biotrophic and necrotrophic pathogens in pioneer vs. shade-tolerant tropical plant species. Considering that pioneer species mainly invest in induced defenses, we expected a negative relationship between the incidence of biotrophic and necrotrophic pathogens; in contrast, as shade-tolerant species invest heavily in constitutive defenses, we expected to find no correlation between the incidence of biotrophic and necrotrophic pathogens. These ideas were evaluated by assessing standing levels of fungal damage in a set of pioneer and shade-tolerant species from the Lacandona tropical rain forest (Mexico). The results showed that among pioneer plant species, leaves with biotrophic lesions were between 34 and 44 percent more abundant than those with necrotic lesions. In contrast, among shade-tolerant species, the proportions of leaves with necrotic lesions were 17-23 percent higher than those of leaves with injuries caused by biotrophic pathogens. Our study suggests that tropical tree species might present different defense strategies depending on the life-style of the pathogens that attack them, and the life history strategy of the attacked host plant species. Thus, the host constitutive and induced defenses, as well as the mechanisms used by different types of pathogens to circumvent those defenses maybe responsible for the patterns of attack observed in perennial tropical plants.

AB Fire is an important agent of disturbance in many tropical ecosystems that can potentially influence plant consumers. Nevertheless, there are few reports on whether levels of plant damage change as a result of fire. Here we present the results of a 1-yr study evaluating the effects of fire on rates of herbivory and damage by pathogens in leaves of cerrado (Brazilian savanna) tree species. Damage by leaf chewers was over two times greater in burned than in unburned trees. Levels of damage by leaf miners, leaf scrapers, galling insects, and leaf pathogens were relatively low and increased, remained the same, or even decreased as a result of fire. Nevertheless, in all three plant species studied, total herbivore damage was significantly greater in burned than in unburned trees given the preponderance of damage caused by leaf chewers compared with the other types of damage. Leaf chewers, mainly leaf-cutter ants, caterpillars, and grasshoppers, completely ate over 50 percent of the > 2000 leaves we marked in burned trees. That our results were consistent among different plant species with contrasting leaf phenologies suggests that the observed increase in herbivory is a general phenomenon in our study system. Because herbivore pressure is augmented dramatically in recently burned areas, herbivory may act synergistically with fire in influencing the structure of cerrado vegetation.

AB Although it is known that forest loss and degradation negatively impact most forest-dwelling primates, such relationships are difficult to quantify because many primates are difficult to survey over large areas. Furthermore, recovery times are also difficult to assess due to a lack of long-term data. Here, we determined how forest characteristics and habitat disturbance correlate with the abundance of pileated gibbons, Hylobates pileatus. We studied a population in Khao Ang Rue Nai Wildlife Sanctuary in southeastern Thailand, assessed its density using an auditory method combined with distance sampling at 24 randomly placed sample sites. In addition, we determined how simple forest structural characteristics and habitat disturbance correlate with the gibbon abundance. Average gibbon density per site was 1.02 +/- 0.16 (SE) groups/km(2) (range 0-2.74). Bivariate analyses indicated that densities depended on food tree biomass, level of disturbance, evergreen forest cover, time since protection, and distance to the sanctuary boundary. Multiple regression analysis suggested evergreen forest cover and distance to boundary were the most influential factors. Because evergreen forest cover, time since protection, and habitat disturbance are correlated, these results suggest a direct dependence of gibbon densities on mature, undisturbed evergreen forest. While gibbons can persist in disturbed areas if the forest is protected, it appears that recovery to previous densities may take decades. We suggest that this is due to the slow pace of forest regeneration and/or poor recovery potential of gibbons.

AB Recent studies on the impacts of forest fragmentation on understory insectivorous birds in the Neotropics have highlighted that even narrow linear clearings, such as roads, can affect the movements of this guild of birds. We used playback trials of territorial vocalizations to assess the movements of three understory insectivorous bird species across two unpaved roads bisecting Parque Estadual Carlos Botelho in southeast Brazil, located within one of the largest remaining continuous Atlantic Forests. Movement patterns varied among species. While Chamaeza campanisona never crossed these roads, Pyriglena leucoptera crossed them in almost 100 percent of tests. Although Conopophaga lineata exhibited a significantly lower number of crossings along cleared sites, it was eventually willing to traverse the roads, showing an intermediate pattern. Shaded areas with connected canopy did not improve birds' willingness to cross roads compared with areas where treecrowns were at least 3 m apart. Similarly, birds' willingness to cross an 8-m wide road with limited traffic (six vehicles/wk) was not significantly greater than that of a 12-m wide road with more intense traffic (41 vehicles/d). Our findings suggest that the negative impact of roads on bird movement is an issue that should be addressed by managers of Atlantic Forest conservation units, especially as economic development results in pressure to pave and widen roads.

AB Experimental studies in temperate regions have revealed that competition and predation interact to shape aquatic communities. Predators typically reduce the effect of competition on growth and competitors provide alternative prey subjects, which may also alter predation. Here, we examine the independent and combined effects of competition and predation on the survival and growth of hatchling tadpoles of two widespread co-occurring Neotropical hylid frogs (Agalychnis callidryas and Dendropsophus ebraccatus). Using 400 L mesocosms, we used a 2 x 3 factorial substitutive design, which crossed tadpole species composition with the presence or absence of a free-roaming predator (Anax amazili dragonfly larva). Dragonflies were effective predators of both species, but had larger effects on A. callidryas survival. Both species had similar growth rates when alone, whereas A. callidryas grew 30 percent faster than D. ebraccatus when they co-occurred, suggesting interspecific rather than intraspecific competition had relatively stronger effects on D. ebraccatus growth, while the opposite was true for A. callidryas. Predator presence dramatically reduced growth rates of both species and erased this asymmetry. Results suggest that the effects of predator induction (i.e., nonconsumptive effects) on growth were larger than both consumptive and competitive effects. Our study demonstrates that predators have strong effects on both survival and growth of prey, highlighting the potential importance of predators in shaping prey populations and tropical aquatic food web interactions.

AB Habitat fragmentation and disturbance are two of the most significant drivers of species extinctions in plant populations. The degree of impact of fragmentation on plant populations depends on the level of specificity of plant-animal interactions, as well as on the availability of suitable sites for seedling recruitment. In this study, we describe the population density and structure, pollen limitation and reproductive success of the endangered tropical orchid Myrmecophila christinae, an epiphytic species with a specialized pollination system. We surveyed a total of 14 populations located in a fragmented landscape. Seedling density was related to habitat disturbance and host plant density; while density of juveniles was related to density of adults. Adult and total individual densities were related to habitat affectation. We also found that fragments < 1 ha had significantly fewer seedlings, as well as an over-representation of large adults. On the other hand, fruit production was higher in fragments > 10 ha, and fruit set was significantly lower in highly disturbed fragments. Hand pollination experiments showed that M. christinae was pollen limited in all the studied populations, suggesting that pollen limitation is unrelated to habitat disturbance. Overall, our results suggest that fragmentation has affected key demographic features of M. christinae, including reproduction and recruitment.

AB The influence of environmental gradients on the foliar nutrient economy of forests has been well documented; however, we have little understanding of what drives variability among individuals within a single forest stand, especially tropical forests. We evaluated inter-and intra-specific variation in nutrient resorption, foliar nutrient concentrations and physical leaf traits of nine canopy tree species within a 1-ha secondary tropical rain forest in northeastern Costa Rica. Both nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) resorption efficiency (RE) and proficiency of the nine tree species varied significantly among species, but not within. Both N and P RE were significantly negatively related to leaf specific strength. Green leaf N and P concentrations were strongly negatively related to leaf mass per area, and senesced leaf nutrient concentrations were significantly positively related to green leaf nutrient concentrations. This study reveals a strong influence of physical leaf traits on foliar nutrient and resorption traits of co-occurring species in a secondary wet tropical forest stand.

AB Conservation management has undergone a dramatic paradigm shift from the strong 'wilderness conservation' ethos of the 1980s and 1990s to the 'biodiversity on degraded lands' ethos of recent years. Most conservation biologists now consider that wilderness conservation alone is no longer sufficient to conserve biodiversity, and conservation strategies must also demand more effective protection for biodiversity on degraded lands. Recognition of this shifting paradigm in biodiversity conservation has led to an overt change in tone of recent studies, emphasizing relatively modest effects of human disturbance, and high biodiversity values on some degraded lands. A case in point is a series of studies from Southeast Asia reporting relatively modest impacts of logging on biodiversity, with the majority of species (75%) persisting after repeated intensive logging. This is a marked shift in conservation message after >30 yrs of research showing substantial adverse effects of logging on biodiversity, and raises serious questions about the appropriate ways to qualify the conflicting messages that 'human impact degrades biodiversity' yet 'degraded habitats have high biodiversity value.' Clearly logging is the lesser of two land-use evils compared with conversion to intensive cattle pastures, crop fields or oil palm plantations, but there is a real risk that overselling the 'biodiversity on degraded lands' paradigm might end up being a double-edged sword for conservation management. After all, if >75 percent of species are resilient to repeated logging, why bother trying to preserve the few remaining wilderness areas from being logged themselves? It remains to be seen whether this new message of 'weak' effects of logging on biodiversity will serve its strategic purpose of conserving biodiversity on degraded lands, or simply devalue the last vestiges of wild nature.

AB Floristic variation is high in the Neotropics, but little is known about the factors shaping this variation at the mesoscale. We examined floristic composition and its relationship with environmental factors across 220 1-ha permanent plots in tropical lowland Bolivia. For each plot, abundance of 100 species (93 tree and 7 palm species >= 10 cm diam) was obtained. Climatic data, related to rainfall seasonality and temperature, were interpolated from all available weather stations in the region, and soil properties, related to texture and fertility, were obtained for each plot. Floristic variation was strongly associated with differences in water availability and temperature, and therefore the climatic gradient shaped floristic variation more strongly than the edaphic gradient. Detrended correspondence analysis ordination divided lowland Bolivia primarily into two major groups (Southern Chiquitano region vs. the Amazon region) and a multiple response permutation procedure distinguished five floristic regions. Overall, the tested environmental variables differed significantly among the five regions. Using indicator species analysis, we distinguished 82 strong indicator species, which had significant environmental preferences for one floristic region. These species can be used as indicators of environmental conditions or to determine which floristic region a certain forest belongs. Given the predicted decreases in rainfall and increases in temperature for tropical lowland forests, our gradient approach suggests that species composition may shift drastically with climate change.

AB Tropical dry forests (TDFs) host a large diversity of tree species but little is known of potential mechanisms that contribute to its maintenance. Given the paramount importance of water availability in such forests, tree species would be expected to show nonrandom patterns along water availability gradients, as well as differential individual species responses. In this work we explored whether that was true for 50 dominant tree species. Within a total area of 5.2 ha, divided into 26 transects each with ten 20 x 10 m plots, we registered presence-absence of these tree species with diameter at breast height >= 5 cm. We assessed the response of trees to four environmental variables differentially related to water availability in three steps: (1) identifying the shape of the response to individual environmental variables, (2) testing for artifacts in previous patterns due to spatial autocorrelation of presence-absence, and (3) identifying the environmental variable or combination of variables that best explained the pattern. We then classified the species with respect to their probability of occurrence along the gradient, and explored which components of the water cycle were likely to be driving the observed patterns. We found that 14 species were generalists, 16 drought tolerant, 9 intermediate, 3 water demanding and 8 showed mixed responses. Lateral flow and access to ground water most likely underlie such patterns. Our results confirm the key role played by water availability in tree species distribution. Water-related niche differentiation seems to be crucial for maintaining the high diversity of this TDF.

AB Quantifying ecosystem carbon stocks is vital for understanding the relationship between changes in land use and carbon dioxide emissions. Here, we estimate carbon stocks in an area of miombo woodland in Mozambique, by identifying the major carbon stocks and their variability. Data on the biomass of tree stems and roots, saplings, and soil carbon stocks are reported and compared with other savannas systems around the globe. A new allometric relationship between stem diameter and tree stem and root biomass is presented, based on the destructive harvest of 29 trees. These allometrics are combined with an inventory of 12,733 trees on 58 plots over an area of 27 ha. Ecosystem carbon stocks totaled 110 tC/ha, with 76 tC/ha in the soil carbon pool (to 50 cm depth), 21.2 tC/ha in tree stem biomass, 8.5 tC/ha in tree coarse root biomass, and 3.6 tC/ha in total sapling biomass. Plot-level tree root:stem (R:S) ratio varied from 0.27 to 0.58, with a mean of 0.42, slightly higher than the mean reported for 18 other savanna sites with comparable aboveground biomass (R:S = 0.35). Tree biomass (stem + root) ranged from 3.1 to 86.5 tC/ha, but the mean (32.1 tC/ha) was well constrained (95% CI 28-36.6). In contrast, soil carbon stocks were almost uniformly distributed and varied from 32 to 133 tC/ha. Soil carbon stocks are thus the major uncertainty in the carbon storage of these woodlands. Soil texture explained 53 percent of the variation in soil carbon content, but only 13 percent of the variation in woody carbon stocks. The history of disturbance (fire, elephants, logging/charcoal production, and shifting cultivation) is likely to decouple changes in woody carbon stocks from soil carbon stocks, mediated by tree grass interactions.

AB We explored patterns of soil and foliar nutrients across nine mature forest sites in Costa Rica, where mean annual precipitation (MAP) ranged between 3500 and 5500 mm, altitude ranged between 200 and 1200 m, and species composition varied among sites. Our objective was to investigate the relationship between rainfall and plant or soil nutrient characteristics to better understand the potential long-term effects that alterations in MAP could have on the nutrient dynamics of wet forest plant communities. Indicators of soil N availability (net mineralization and nitrification) decreased with MAP but were not related to foliar N. Soil and foliar P, by contrast, were not correlated with MAP but were positively correlated with each other. Thus, across our gradient foliar P was a better predictor of soil nutrient availability than foliar N. There were wide differences in foliar nutrient concentrations and N:P ratios among species within sites. At each site, legumes had higher mean percent N than nonlegumes, resulting in higher N:P ratios for legumes. Taken together, these data suggest that, at least in these forests, a climate-driven decrease in MAP could cause an increase in net N mineralization and nitrification for the wetter sites. However, this may not affect productivity at the community level because of low P availability, complex feedbacks between soil and foliar nutrients, and interactions with other biological and environmental factors such as elevation.

AB We studied three different size classes of liana abundance representing proxies for three different life stages and aimed to identify the sequence of ecological filters that have led to current patterns of liana abundance. We tested the relationship between vegetation structure (including antagonistic support types) and soil texture on liana abundance, using 40 plots (1 and 0.25 ha) set at least 1 km apart, and distributed over 64 km(2) in a Central Amazonian terra firme forest. Three support types were considered: palms, thin trees and an index of vegetation structure. Liana size classes responded hierarchically to ecological filters: larger size classes were progressively less associated with the environmental variables, while different aspects of vegetation structure were related to individual size classes. This hierarchical pattern suggests that selection mechanisms change throughout liana life cycles. Our results show that vegetation structure is an important predictor of liana abundance at a mesoscale and highlights the importance of considering the spatial structure in studies of tropical liana communities.

We analyzed the effects of three 2004 hurricanes among the strongest on record in Florida on vital rates of 12 rare plant species of pyrogenic interior Florida scrub and sandhill. Tree damage varied by vegetation type (being highest in areas with Pinus clausa) and was associated with debris deposition. Most rare species were minimally impacted by hurricanes. The two most frequently damaged species were the shrubs Prunus geniculata (11% of individuals) and Asimina obovata (7%); both were resilient to damage. Prunus geniculata had little mortality during the hurricane year but damaged plants had a temporary (1-yr) reduction in relative growth rate. Prunus geniculata flowering was unaffected by hurricane damage. Hurricane damage had no effects on vital rates of A. obovata, Eriogonum longifolium var. gnaphalifolium, or Chrysopsis highlandsensis. Other species suffered little or no observable hurricane damage. Of 12 species analyzed, nine had similar annual survival in hurricane and nonhurricane years. Relatively low survival in the hurricane year (compared with other years) was linked to prehurricane drought or prescribed fire in two of three species. Thus, the 2004 hurricanes did not have important effects on populations of interior Florida scrub and sandhill plants, especially herbaceous species. This is in marked contrast to dramatic demographic responses to fire in central Florida and strong effects of hurricanes in coastal Florida, highlighting that these different disturbances may have divergent effects on vegetation and populations over short distances.

AB The regeneration of many tropical trees is threatened by forest fragmentation because it produces major physical, biological and ecological changes that limit seed germination and seedling establishment. We analyzed the regenerative potential of an old growth forest tree species-Ampelocera hottlei (Ulmaceae)-in three contrasting habitats located in the Lacandona rain forest, southeastern Mexico: continuous forest, fragments occupied by black howler monkeys (Alouatta pigra) and fragments unoccupied by howlers. We tested if germination of A. hottlei seeds among habitats was affected by understory temperature, light incidence and ingestion by A. pigra. We compared seedling survival and relative growth rate in height (RGR(H)) for 20 d among habitats and between ingested and control seeds (from mature fruits). Germination was higher in continuous forest than in fragments (occupied or not), with higher germination rates for ingested seeds in fragments. Temperature and light incidence were lower in continuous forest than in fragments. Germination decreased with increasing temperature and light incidence with this relationship being significantly higher for ingested seeds. Seedling survival was higher in continuous forest than in fragments, whereas RGRH did not differ among habitats. In addition, survival and RGRH were higher in seedlings originating from ingested seeds. Overall, our results suggest that the populations of A. hottlei can be limited in fragments where changes in the understory physical environment and the extirpation of A. pigra will likely have deleterious consequences for the regeneration of A. hottlei and possibly for other tree species, ultimately affecting forest composition and structure.

AB Decrease in the species composition similarity of herbivore assemblages with increasing phylogenetic distance between host plants is a widespread pattern. Here we used data for caterpillars in the Brazilian Cerrado to investigate how the similarity in caterpillar species composition decreases as the taxonomic level and genetic distance (GD) of their host plants increases. In addition, we elucidate the plant taxonomic level that provides the greatest contribution to turnover in the caterpillar species composition among host taxa. Adult Lepidoptera were reared from caterpillars collected from 52 plants over 13 yr in the same area, with each host plant sampled for 1 yr. Most species were specialists, with 66 percent of genus specialists among the nonsingleton species. The similarity in caterpillar species composition across plant taxa decreased from host species to genera, and from host genera to orders. Above this level, the similarity was consistently low. The GD between plants explained 82 percent of the variation in the similarity of caterpillar species composition. The contribution of caterpillar species turnover among host orders from the same superorder and among host superorders from the same subclass explained 70 percent of the caterpillar species richness as a whole. Our results lend support to the view that most tropical caterpillars are host specialists. Our findings further indicate that the number of orders and superorders of plants provide the greatest contribution to the total caterpillar richness compared with all of the other host taxonomic levels combined.

AB Termites are an important component of tropical rain forests, and have been included in many studies focusing on the influence of human disturbance. Their distribution among primary rain forest has, however, rarely been investigated. Here we studied the termite fauna in seven mostly undisturbed forest sites, representing several rain forest types. Overall, approximately 70 percent of species were soil-feeders and 25 percent were wood-feeders, the remaining 5 percent being classified here as litter-feeders. Termite species richness did not differ significantly among sites, but sites differed in termite abundance. The palm swamp and the low forest situated on the foothills of an inselberg, hosted different termite communities to the other sites. These two sites presented a singular physiognomy suggesting that forest type is an important factor influencing species composition. We found no correlation between termite species composition and distance between sites, highlighting that at the scale of our study (about 100 km), forest sites share a similar species pool.

AB The metacommunity framework integrates species-specific responses to environmental gradients to detect emergent patterns of mesoscale organization. Abiotic characteristics (temperature, precipitation) and associated vegetation types change with elevation in a predictable fashion, providing opportunities to decouple effects of environmental gradients per se from those of biogeographical or historical origin. Moreover, expected structure is different if a metacommunity along an elevational gradient is molded by idiosyncratic responses to abiotic variables (expectation = Gleasonian structure) than if such a metacommunity is molded by strong habitat preferences or specializations (expectation = Clementsian structure). We evaluated metacommunity structure for 13 species of gastropod from 15 sites along an elevational transect in the Luquillo Experimental Forest of Puerto Rico. Analyses were conducted separately for the primary axis and for the secondary axis of correspondence extracted via reciprocal averaging. The metacommunity exhibited quasi-Clementsian structure along the primary axis, which represented a gradient of gastropod species specialization that was unassociated with elevation. The secondary axis represented environmental variation associated with elevation. Along this axis, the metacommunity exhibited Clementsian structure, with specialists characterizing each of three suites of sites that corresponded to three distinct forest types. These forest types are associated with low (tabonuco forest), mid- (palo colorado forest), or high (elfin forest) elevations. Thus, variation among sites in species composition reflected two independent processes: the first decoupled from elevational variation and its environmental correlates, and the second highly associated with environmental variation correlated with elevation.

AB Differences in intraspecific foraging strategies have been documented between sexes of strongly dimorphic large herbivore species. Body size implications on diet quality requirements, however, can be extended to within-species age-specific comparisons. We investigated the hierarchical separation of foraging behavior at the scale of plant type, plant species, plant part and vertically through the canopy. For this, we studied African elephant adult females (lower quality diet required) and weaned calves (higher quality diet) within the elephant family unit, which is socially constrained to traverse the landscape together. Grass and browse were used with similar seasonal frequency. Both females and calves tracked the phenology of woody species, including these species in the diet when new growth was available. Forage utilization differed at the plant part level, with calves selecting for less fibrous and more nutritious plant parrs (e.g., stripped leaves), while adult females selected branches, bark and roots with greater frequency. There was displacement of females to higher foraging levels in the canopy when these females fed <3m away from calves. Elephant family unit foraging strategies were driven by body size, age-specific nutritional requirements and intraspecific competition. This has broader application to other large herbivore species with great variance in intraspecific body size.

AB Habitat fragmentation is a widespread phenomenon that alters pollination and plant reproductive processes. These effects have demographic and genetic implications that determine offspring fitness and the long-term viability of plant populations in fragmented systems. We evaluated fragmentation effects on early plant offspring fitness traits, individual seed mass, and percentage of seed germination in five native plant species (Acacia raven, Celtis ehrenbergiana, Croton lachnostachyus, Rivina humilis, Schinus fasciculatus) from the Chaco Serrano forest, a subtropical highly fragmented ecosystem. We found evidence of strong negative fragmentation effects on germination in the shrub C. lachnostachyus and the perennial herb R. humilis, after 30 d of controlled tests. No fragmentation effects were found in the studied traits on the remaining three tree species. We found significant maternal effects in offspring fitness traits in all five species. We discuss the relative magnitude of maternal vs. fragmentation effects taking into account both plant species' lifespan and the time elapsed in fragmentation conditions. We emphasize the need to increase the study of early and late plant offspring fitness produced in fragmented habitats coupled with analyses of genetic parameters and the pollination process in order to evaluate the conservation value of remnant forest fragments.

AB The inclusion of carbon stock enhancements under the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) framework will likely drive a rapid increase in biosequestration projects that remove carbon from the atmosphere through rehabilitation of degraded primary rain forests. Such projects could also present an important opportunity to reverse losses of biodiversity from degraded rain forests, but concern has recently been expressed that management interventions to increase carbon stocks may conflict with biodiversity conservation. Focusing on a large-scale rain forest rehabilitation project in northern Borneo, we examine: (i) how intensive rehabilitation of selectively logged forests affected patterns of bird community composition and (ii) whether changes in vegetation structure explain observed shifts in avian guild structure and species composition. Bird composition differed between unlogged, naturally regenerating logged, and rehabilitated logged habitats, with the avifauna of rehabilitated forest more similar to that of naturally regenerating forest. Crucially, rehabilitation did not adversely affect either those species that declined after logging or those species that are IUCN Red Listed. Rehabilitation reduced the prevalence of vines and shrubs within regenerating forest, and across all habitats, the abundance and species richness of all birds and of obligate frugivores were positively related to vine prevalence. In contrast, the abundance and richness of frugivore-insectivore generalists and of salliers were negatively related to vines, suggesting that avifaunal responses to forest rehabilitation were attributable to liberation cutting of vines. Management intervention to increase carbon stocks had little adverse effect on avian biodiversity and we therefore argue that rain forest rehabilitation should play a strong role in future REDD+ agreements.

AB Ateline monkeys, the largest primates in the Neotropics, may disperse more than one million seeds/km(2)/d at sites where they are abundant, but it is unclear whether a reduction in their populations can alter plant diversity patterns. The species richness and composition of regenerating plants as a proxy of future plant communities were studied by comparing 16 sites with different attune abundance in three countries in northwestern South America. A total of 3658 plots included 94,340 regenerating plants, which were assigned to species or morphospecies. Paired t-tests comparing sites in the same region but with different densities of atelines, and regression analyses showed a consistent positive relationship between ateline density and plant diversity. These results were due to the larger number of stems per area and higher evenness at sites with more atelines, suggesting higher recruitment rates for dispersed seeds. Differences were also found in plant composition, as canopy, endozoochorous, and medium seed size plants were consistently more abundant in sites with more ateline monkeys than in sites with less atelines. The findings of this study suggest that these primates play a key role in plant regeneration. In order to maintain the diversity and plant composition of tropical forests for future generations, conservation of these large frugivores and other key game species is imperative.

AB Seeds from Pachira brevipes from white-sand forest and Pachira insignis from clay forest were placed in a reciprocal transplant experiment that manipulated herbivore presence. Pachira insignis experienced 80 percent leaf loss in both habitats from herbivores, causing 79 percent mortality in white-sand compared with 47 percent in clay in just 3 mo. Pachira brevipes suffered pathogen attack in both habitats that killed 90 percent of its establishing seedlings. Natural enemies thus strongly influence seedling recruitment of these two Pachira species in these forests and appear to have the largest impact within the seedlings' first few months.

AB For organisms involved in specialized ecological interactions, the potential exists to have congruent evolutionary histories, such that diversification within one lineage of organisms parallels diversification within another. This model of shared evolutionary history has most often been explored in a bitrophic context, particularly with plants and specialized herbivorous insects, though also with other ecological partners such as vertebrate hosts and their invertebrate parasites. Recently, the possibility has been raised that evolutionary histories might be shared across more than two trophic levels, a phenomenon that we term a phylogenetic cascade. We review previous work on tritrophic diversification and discuss outstanding questions, with an emphasis on plants, caterpillars, and parasitoids, in diverse tropical communities.

AB In degraded tropical pastures, active restoration strategies have the potential to facilitate forest regrowth at rates that are faster than natural recovery, enhancing litterfall, and nutrient inputs to the forest floor. We evaluated litterfall and nutrient dynamics under four treatments: plantation (entire area planted), tree islands (planting in six patches of three sizes), control (same age natural regeneration), and young secondary forest (7-9-yr-old natural regeneration). Treatments were established in plots of 50 x 50 m at six replicate sites in southern Costa Rica and the annual litterfall production was measured 5 yr after treatment establishment. Planted species included two native timber-producing hardwoods (Terminalia amazonia and Vochysia guatemalensis) interplanted with two N-fixing species (Inga edulis and Erythrina poeppigiana). Litter production was highest in secondary forests (7.3 Mg/ha/yr) and plantations (6.3), intermediate in islands (3.5), and lowest in controls (1.4). Secondary forests had higher input of all nutrients except N when compared with the plantation plots. Inga contributed 70 percent of leaffall in the plantations, demonstrating the influence that one species can have on litter quantity and quality. Although tree islands had lower litterfall rates, they were similar to plantations in inputs of Mg, K, P, Zn, and Mn. Tree islands increased litter production and nutrient inputs more quickly than natural regeneration. In addition to being less resource intensive than conventional plantations, this planting design promotes a more rapid increase in litter diversity and more spatial heterogeneity, which can accelerate the rate of nutrient cycling and facilitate forest recovery.

AB Large parts of the everwet tropics have been burned, leaving many unburned-burned forest edges. Here we studied a Bornean forest edge to determine: (1) how unburned and burned forest differ in vegetation structure, diversity, composition and plant functional traits 7 yr after fire, and (2) if these variables showed significant edge effects. Environmental and inventory data from 120 plots (0.01 ha each), covering both sides of a similar to 1.3 km forest boundary were sampled. Differences in vegetation structure, diversity, composition and plant functional traits were analyzed in relation to disturbance type (Mann-Whitney tests) and edge distance (partial correlation analysis that controlled for confounding effects of elevation, slope and fire intensity). Seven years after fire, burned forest differed significantly from unburned forest in most measured variables while few significant edge effects were detected, i.e., there existed a sharp delimitation between the two forest types. The regeneration of the burned forest depended almost entirely on in situ recruitment with little input of late successional species from the neighboring old growth forest. On the other hand, old growth forest showed few signs of edge degradation. A possible explanation for these results might be related to the absence of a mast fruiting event during these first 7 yr of forest recovery, resulting in low levels of late successional species seed input into the burned forest, combined with the quick development of a closed canopy in the burned forest by early successional species that shielded the unburned forest from adverse edge effects.

AB In seasonally dry tropical forests, tree species can be deciduous, remaining without leaves throughout the dry season, or evergreen, retaining their leaves throughout the dry season. Deciduous and evergreen trees specialize in habitats that differ in water availability (hillside and riparian forest, respectively) and in their exposure to herbivore attack (seasonal and continuous, respectively). We asked whether syndromes of leaf traits in deciduous and evergreen trees were consistent with hypothesized abiotic and biotic selective pressures in their respective habitat. We measured seven leaf traits in 19 deciduous and 11 evergreen tree species in a dry tropical forest in Western Mexico, and measured rates of herbivory on 23 of these species. We investigated the covariance of leaf traits in syndromes related to phenology and associated physiology, and to anti-herbivory defense. We found evidence for syndromes that separated phenological strategies among four traits: toughness, water content, specific leaf area, and carbon:nitrogen (C:N) ratios. We found a trade-off between two other traits: trichomes and latex. Overall, evergreen species exhibited lower rates of herbivory than deciduous species. Lower rates of herbivory were explained by a syndrome of higher toughness, lower water content, and higher C:N ratios, which are traits representative of evergreen trees. Phenology and trait syndromes did not exhibit significant phylogenetic signal, consistent with the hypothesis of evolutionary convergence among phenologies and associated leaf-trait syndromes. Our results suggest that deciduous and evergreen trees could respond to differential water availability and herbivory in their respective habitats by converging on distinct leaf-trait syndromes.

AB Although Ficus (Moraceae) is a keystone plant genus in the tropics, providing resources to many frugivorous vertebrates, its population genetic structure, which is an important determinant of its long-term survival, has rarely been investigated. We examined the population genetic structure of two dioecious fig species (Ficus hispida and Ficus exasperata) in the Indian Western Ghats using co-dominant nuclear microsatellite markers. We found high levels of microsatellite genetic diversity in both species. The regression slopes between genetic relationship coefficients (f(ij)) and spatial distances were significantly negative in both species indicating that, on average, individuals in close spatial proximity were more likely to be related than individuals further apart. Mean parent-offspring distance (Sigma) calculated using these slopes was about 200 m in both species. This should be contrasted with the very long pollen dispersal distances documented for monoecious Ficus species. Nevertheless, overall population genetic diversity remained large suggesting immigrant gene flow. Further studies will be required to analyze broader scale patterns.

AB In species with broad distribution, geographic variation could be associated to particular environmental factors that may affect plant reproduction. In dimorphic species, environmental factors may influence evolutionary processes governing sex ratio variation and floral traits evolution. Kallstroemia grandiflora is an annual insect-pollinated gynodioecious herb with broad distribution from the Sonoran desert to the semiarid west coast of Mexico. In this study, we explored if female frequency increases in harsh environments and the associated changes in floral morphology in female and hermaphrodite plants. We selected 23 populations along the pacific coast of Mexico where we estimated female frequency and in eight of them we also measured flower size in hermaphrodite and female plants. The average decrease in precipitation was correlated with the increase in female frequency, and a reduction in the flower size of hermaphrodite plants. Our results support the idea that harsh environments may influence female frequency, but also flower size and possibly breeding system evolution.

AB Integrating phylogenetic data into macroecological studies of biodiversity patterns may complement the information provided by present-day spatial patterns. In the present study, we used range map data for all Geonoma (Arecaceae) species to assess whether Geonoma species composition forms spatially coherent floristic clusters. We then evaluated the extent to which the spatial variation in species composition reflects present-day environmental variation vs. nonenvironmental spatial effects, as expected if the pattern reflects historical biogeography. We also examined the degree of geographic structure in the Geonoma phylogeny. Finally, we used a dated phylogeny to assess whether species richness within the floristic clusters was constrained by a specific historical biogeographic driver, namely time-for-diversification. A cluster analysis identified six spatially coherent floristic clusters, four of which were used to reveal a significant geographic phylogenetic structure. Variation partitioning analysis showed that 56 percent of the variation in species composition could be explained by spatial variables alone, consistent with historical factors having played a major role in generating the Geonoma diversity pattern. To test for a time-for-diversification effect, we correlated four different species richness measures with the diversification time of the earliest large lineage that is characteristic of each cluster. In support of this hypothesis, we found that geographic areas with higher richness contained older radiations. We conclude that current geographic diversity patterns in Geonoma reflect the present-day climate, but to a larger extent are related to nonenvironmental spatial constraints linked to colonization time, dispersal limitation, and geological history, followed by within-area evolutionary diversification.

AB Habitat fragmentation can break down the movement processes of frugivorous animals, thus influencing the relationship between plants and their seed dispersers by altering the number and identity of seed dispersers, and their relative contribution to seed dispersal. We studied the assemblages of frugivorous birds, their composition, species richness, and visitation rates to fruiting plants growing in the different landscape elements (forest fragments, live fences, and trees isolated in pastures) embedded in a Brazilian fragmented, agricultural landscape. By following the post-feeding movements of frugivorous birds, we inferred the direction of seed movement from and to each of these landscape elements. Fruiting trees growing at different landscape elements were visited by frugivorous birds at similar rates. Isolated trees attracted a greater and distinct bird assemblage than trees in forest fragments or live fences. Judging by the post-feeding flights of birds, the seeds of isolated trees were the most likely to reach all the landscape elements considered, but the contribution of isolated trees to the seeds falling in forested habitats or pastures depended on their degree of isolation. A few bird species were able to move widely, visiting fruiting plants in all landscape elements, and promoting long-distance dispersal for plants. These few birds are of special interest because they are mobile links that connect habitats in fragmented landscapes with their seed dispersal services.

AB The diversity of mutualistic interactions influences many ecological components of community structure, including biodiversity and ecosystem stability. However, mutualistic interactions are not well resolved because of a historical bias toward examining antagonistic interactions. Here we examine both antagonistic and facilitative interactions between tropical plants and arthropods by characterizing the biotic interactions between a common myrmecophytic shrub, Piper immutatum Trel. (Piperaceae), the ants hosted by this plant, Pheidole sp. (Formicidae: Myrmicinae), and their associated communities of herbivorous and predatory arthropods. To determine if ant mutualists affect the altitudinal distribution of Neotropical myrmecophytes, P. immutatum interactions with arthropods were quantified across a tropical elevational gradient. Piper immutatum was most abundant in lower montane forests (1000-1600 m asl) and disappeared above 1600 m asl, and colonies of Pheidole sp. inhabited 90 percent of the sampled plants. The myrmecophyte was then transplanted within and beyond its altitudinal range, excluding ants from half of the transplanted plants. Plant survival was affected primarily by elevation, with only 20 percent surviving above 1600 m asl. Ant exclusion did not significantly affect plant mortality. Nevertheless, ant colony size did affect both herbivory and nutrient availability for surviving P. immutatum, with nutrient availability having a stronger effect than antiherbivore defense on growth and biomass. This approach of studying the contributions of ant mutualisms across the myrmecohpyte's habitat range yields an improved picture of the role of mutualistic interactions in determining community structure.

AB On the island of Lombok, Indonesia, three nectarivorous birds partially coexist: the two closely related and very similar Lichmera honeyeaters and a sunbird (Cinnyris jugularis). We investigated how these species segregated ecologically in areas where they coexisted by evaluating foraging visits and aggressive interactions at rich and poor nectar resources in different habitats (forest and open areas) along an altitudinal gradient (800-1600 m asl). The two honeyeaters were partially segregated by altitude. In the zone of overlap, Lichmera limbata dominated the richest forest resources, while Lichmera lombokia dominated the richest resources in open land. The sunbird, C. jugularis, was only observed in open habitats and mostly at poor resource patches. In the three-species community in open habitats a dominance hierarchy was apparent with L. lombokia as the superior species and C. jugularis as the inferior species. Studies on how segregated species interact in their transition zone can help us to understand interactions between otherwise ecologically segregated species.

AB Toucans (Ramphastidae) are highly frugivorous, widespread throughout the Neotropics, and travel long distances, thus likely providing dispersal for many tropical trees. Despite being large conspicuous members of the canopy and subcanopy bird community, their movement ecology has been little studied. To understand how these frugivores move through a lowland tropical forest, I tracked the movements of Ramphastos tucanus (White-throated Toucan), Ramphastos vitellinus (Channel-billed Toucan), and Pteroglossus pluricinctus (Many-banded Aracari) in Yasuni National Park, Ecuador. The objectives of this study were to use radiotelemetry to estimate toucan home ranges, movement patterns, and potential seed dispersal distances. Using canopy nets, a total of 20 P. pluricinctus and three Ramphastos toucans were captured, radio-tagged, and tracked over a 4-yr period from 2001 to 2005. Average home range sizes were 191 and 86 ha for P. pluricinctus and Ramphastos toucans, respectively. The maximum travel distance in a single 30-min tracking interval was 3665 m for P. pluricinctus and 3027 m for Ramphastos. Estimated dispersal distances of medium-sized seeds ranged from 269 to 449 m. Large home range size and long-distance movements indicate that toucans likely disperse seeds over a scale of hundreds of meters. This study is the first to estimate home range size of any toucan species in intact closed-canopy forests.

AB Agricultural activities represent a global threat to biodiversity, yet little is known about the relative importance of different agricultural land uses in relation to their wildlife communities. We explored bird community structure, diversity, and composition in a landscape dominated by primary tropical dry forest, and in three agricultural systems (i.e., tree orchards, herbaceous cropfields, cattle pastures) to evaluate the way in which birds use different habitats within the landscape. Tropical dry forests had the highest species richness and community evenness, although the bird community in tree orchards was also relatively species rich and even. Cattle pastures had more bird species than cropfields but both habitats were comparatively species poor with low evenness. Our results are related to habitat structure and the spatial location of sites within the landscape matrix. Based on our observations, we recommend including native tree species within agricultural systems and surrounding areas to provide additional resources for birds. Finally, we suggest promoting natural recruitment of native trees and shrubs within cattle pastures to provide suitable habitat for species that use tropical dry forest plants.

AB Madagascar's ecosystems are subject to high levels of anthropogenic disturbance and stochastic events, including cyclones. We investigated the abundance of gray-headed lemurs (Eulemur cinereiceps) and vegetation structure in the fragmented forest of Manombo from 1995 to 2007, including 10 yr following Cyclone Gretelle in January 1997. We predicted that the density of this arboreal, frugivorous lemur would be similar in the pre- and post-cyclone intervals only if tree measures demonstrate trends toward recovery in the post-cyclone period. Initial impacts included severe damage to over 60 percent of trees. After 10 yr, all vegetation metrics except for stem density remained low relative to the pre-cyclone period, including dbh, height, and basal area. To investigate vegetation changes separately from cyclone effects, we compared forest structure in the pre-cyclone period alone. Basal area declined but dbh and stem density did not vary between 1995 and 1997; thus, anthropogenic activities or other factors did not consistently alter forest structure in this 2-yr period. Subsequent changes may be linked to cyclone response, presumably in synergy with human disturbance. Contrary to predictions, recent gray-headed lemur population densities were nearly identical to those recorded in 1995 (13.5 +/- 3.2 vs. 13.6 +/- 6.4 individuals/km2, respectively). Lemur populations may have remained stable or declined initially and then recovered in the last 10 yr. Life history and ecological adaptations may explain their resistance or resilience when faced with habitat change. Recent models suggest that lemurs have evolved in response to unpredictable environmental conditions. Such environmental variability may increase with projected climate change.

AB In many species males vocally advertise for mates in choruses and these choruses serve as acoustic beacons to conspecific females as well as to eavesdropping predators and parasites. Chorusing will often cease in response to disturbances, such as the presence of predators. In some cases the cessation is so rapid and over such a large area that it seems improbable that males are all responding directly to the same local disturbance. Here, we demonstrate experimentally in Neotropical tungara frogs, Physalaemus pustulosus, that the cessation of calling by males spreads rapidly through the chorus. The cessation of chorusing in response to the cessation of playbacks of three calling males is more effective in inducing chorus cessation than is the cessation of one male calling. When three males are calling, the cessation of complex calls is more effective in inducing chorus cessation than simple calls. There is no main effect on whether the final call of the male is complete or is interrupted. We thus conclude that the sudden lack of signals-the 'sounds of silence'-becomes an alarm cue that can explain the rapid cessation of choruses that are common in many chorusing species.

AB Calandrinia galapagosa (Portulacaceae) is a threatened plant endemic to San Cristobal Island, Galapagos. The species is threatened by goat herbivory: less than 1300 individuals remain in nine populations, three of which have been fenced for protection. It is not known whether these three populations are genetically representative of the species at large or whether the three distinct color morphs exhibited by the species represent different taxonomic units. We measured the frequency of 113 polymorphic amplified fragment length polymorphism markers in 189 specimens representing three different phenotypes from all nine populations to relate the genetic structure of the species to both its geological history and morphological variation. The analysis revealed high diversity within populations and low, but significant, differentiation between populations. In addition, no genetic diversification was observed across color morphs. We conclude that (1) regular gene flow has historically occurred between populations, and (2) individual color morphs are not separate taxa. We identify another population that should be fenced to ensure maximal protection of genetic variation. Our research serves as a case study of using population molecular genetics for optimizing protection strategies for rare plants in tropical archipelagoes affected by introduced herbivores.

AB We describe a new method for estimating population density of vocally responsive animals, which is based on playback calls coupled with auditory point transect sampling. The method yielded, for red titi monkeys (Callicebus discolor), better estimates than traditional line transect surveys. We propose it as an effective alternative for sampling certain cryptic, but vocally responsive animal species.

AB Previous research has shown that ancient Maya 'forest gardens'-tree-dominated home gardens containing a diversity of tree species used for daily household needs-still resonate in the species composition of the modern forest. Centuries of positive interspecies interactions may enhance the reproductive and survival success of garden species selected and encouraged by experienced Maya forest gardeners. We hypothesized that such interaction may result in aggregated spatial patterns between 32 pre-selected, commonly utilized forest garden species. In this paper, we developed a novel randomization (Monte Carlo) method designed to measure and test if the spatial relationships among pairs of Maya 'forest garden' trees species differ between areas that experienced high and low ancient settlement density in northwestern Belize. A total of 28 high ancient settlement density and 27 low ancient settlement density plots containing a total of 2772 and 3134 trees, respectively, were used for this study. The analysis revealed that 58 pairs of forest garden species tended to 'cluster' together significantly more often in the high settlement density areas than would be expected in a random distribution. In low settlement density plots, only 12 pairs of species exhibited a significant clustered spatial relationship. The effect was not species specific, suggesting that some synergistic relationships, mediated by third-party agents such as dispersers, may occur at the community level. The impacts of ancient human land use, echoing across centuries of dispersal, colonization, disturbance, and biotic and abiotic interactions, can have important implications for understanding the current biodiversity patterns and processes.

AB The Amazon Basin, representing the largest expanse of intact tropical rain forest on the planet, harbors the largest diversity of amphibians and reptiles in the world. Limited elevation and climate differences across the Basin belie one major division of upland forests - geomorphological soil age and induced nutrient levels. We hypothesized that secondary consumers in the leaf litter herpetofauna community on ancient soils of Central Amazonia would exhibit reduced biomass compared with those found on younger soils of Western Amazonia, and that population densities on ancient soils could be driven below viable thresholds, reducing species richness. We found overall herpetofauna abundance, biomass and richness on young soils in Ecuador were significantly greater than those on ancient soils in the Brazilian Amazon. Separately, amphibians were only slightly more abundant, but their biomass on younger soils was twice that on ancient soils. Even more impressive was the variation exhibited by lizards: abundance was not significantly different, but biomass was five times greater on younger soils. Diversity of both taxa was greater on young soils. The most important driver of differences in herpetofauna biomass, abundance and possibly diversity across Amazonia may be the underlying geomorphologic differences. Reduced primary productivity on ancient soils appears to reverberate up the food chain, leaving fewer resources for higher trophic levels. We suggest that conservation initiatives must compensate for reduced biomass on ancient soils through increased reserve size, especially as forest fragmentation escalates. This study highlights the importance of including biomass as a standard measure in herpetofauna sampling.

AB In tropical forests, much of the plant diversity is due to a large number of congeneric taxa. It is unclear what ecological processes are responsible for the number and composition of co-occurring species in these forests. Here, we present strong evidence that microhabitat heterogeneity may contribute to the coexistence of many different Inga species in just 100 ha. We examined their patterns of abundance and diversity in 75 transects related to the edaphic variables: soil water content, pH and soil texture at three different microtopographical units (ridges, slopes and valleys). We used two different approaches: Inga community level analyses and individual-species analyses. Multivariate analyses, controlled for spatial autocorrelation, demonstrated that species show a distributional gradient mainly related to soil water content and to a lesser degree pH. Individual-species analyses determined that obligate microhabitat restriction is uncommon: only 2 of 37 species analyzed were restricted to a single microhabitat. Habitat association analyses, however, identified a number of species characteristic of the ridge, slope and valley microhabitats. We conclude that the environmental setting plays an important role in the Inga community assembly but is not sufficient to explain the coexistence of 37 sympatric species at a single site.

AB Secondary habitats are increasing in importance in tropical countries due to ongoing destruction of pristine vegetation. In spite of the magnitude of current changes, our understanding of their effects on nontrees (e.g., nonvascular or vascular epiphytes) is still very patchy, particularly in lowland habitats. Here, we report a study with isolated pasture trees in southwest Panama. The > 800 studied trees, which belonged to > 100 different species, harbored almost 27,000 epiphytes of 83 species. Orchidaceae was the most species-rich family, with almost 60 percent of all species, while Bromeliaceae were most abundant. A rainfall gradient in the study region from ca 1000 to > 3000 mm explained more of the variation in species abundance and richness than host characteristics (e.g., species identity, tree size). The unexpectedly large number of epiphytes in these pastures still represents a substantial change relative to a natural setting, which is suggested by a comparison with a forest inventory under similar climatic conditions. In pastures, species richness was lower as deduced from individual-based rarefaction curves, a larger proportion of species and individuals showed crassulacean acid metabolism, and the relationship of epiphyte abundance/species richness and tree diameter was much less steep. Even the already reduced diversity, however, may be only transient in secondary habitats-the long-term persistence of epiphyte populations in pastures is an open question and has to be addressed by repeated monitoring to fully evaluate the significance of pasture trees for the conservation of vascular epiphytes in tropical lowlands.

AB A current key issue in ecology is the role of spatial effects on population and community dynamics. In this paper, we test several hypotheses related to spatial structures and coexistence of epiphytic tropical orchid species with special emphasis on the endemic species Broughtonia cubensis. More specifically, we explored the spatial structure of orchid-host plant communities at three different levels of organization (occupied vs. nonoccupied host trees, trees with B. cubensis vs. other orchids, and reproductive vs. nonreproductive B. cubensis plants). We mapped all potential host trees and orchids at three 20 x 20 m plots and applied techniques of spatial point pattern analysis such as mark connection and mark correlation functions to evaluate departures from randomized communities. We found spatial aggregation of trees with epiphytic orchids and segregation between trees with and without epiphytic orchids, and that there was an intraspecific spatial aggregation of B. cubensis in relation to the other seven epiphytic orchid species. Furthermore, we found spatial aggregation of reproductive B. cubensis individuals and segregation between reproductive and nonreproductive individuals on their phorophytes. Thus, orchid-host plant communities show hierarchical spatial structuring with aggregation and segregation at different levels of organization. Our results point to an enhancement of local species in the coexistence of tropical epiphytic orchid communities, by reducing competition through niche differentiation.

AB Although species specificity between fig trees and their pollinators has been considered a classic example of obligate mutualism, increasing exceptions to the one-to-one relationship suggest that multiple pollinator species per fig host species may be a pervasive phenomenon. Based on both mitochondrial DNA and microsatellite analyses, we found three putative pollinator species (Ceratosolen spp.) associated with Ficus spetica in southern Taiwan, two of which, that differ in color, routinely coexist within single figs. These three pollinators are substantially divergent from the pollinator of F. spetica in New Guinea, implying that wasp diversity may be highly underestimated when the one-to-one rule is assumed. Our findings not only provide the first case of coexistence of pollinators within single figs on a shared dioecious Ficus host, but also an ideal system to investigate interspecific competition and sex allocation, especially when coexisting pollinators are visually distinguishable by their colors.

AB Among vertebrates, anuran amphibians represent the highest number of species associated with bromeliads and possess a range of ecological, behavioral, and morphological specializations to life in these plants. Despite the importance of bromeliads as biodiversity amplifiers, and their diversity in some habitats, studies of the relationship between anurans and these plants are scarce in Brazil. Here, we investigated the way anurans select and use bromeliads in a threatened coastal habitat. We analyzed data from 23 standardized samples of the anurans associated with the bromeliad Neoregelia cruenta in the Restinga de Marica, State of Rio de Janeiro, Southeastern Brazil. We found nine anuran species using these bromeliads, representing the highest richness reported for a Brazilian restinga. We identified a general pattern of bromeliad usage, where plants located at the edges of scrub patches (exposed to the sun) were more frequently occupied by anurans than those located more to the center (in the shade). There is strong evidence of an active selective process based on the quality of the water stored in the rosette, which differs between plants depending on their position in the scrub patch. Although the number of individuals varied during the period of study, the frequency of bromeliads used was constant, indicating that plant occupation follows a regular pattern throughout the year. Furthermore, the high frequency of bromeliads used by anurans during the whole year highlights the importance of considering these plants in developing conservation programs concerning the protection of anurans.

AB One of the five most important global biodiversity hotspots, the Neotropical Atlantic forest supports a diverse community of birds that nest in tree cavities. Cavity-nesting birds may be particularly sensitive to forestry and agricultural practices that remove potential nest trees; however, there have been few efforts to determine what constitutes a potential nest tree in Neotropical forests. We aimed to determine the characteristics of trees and cavities used in nesting by excavators (species that excavate their own nest cavity) and secondary cavity-nesters (species that rely on existing cavities), and to identify the characteristics of trees most likely to contain suitable cavities in the Atlantic forest of Argentina. We used univariate analyses and conditional logistic regression models to compare characteristics of nest trees paired with unused trees found over three breeding seasons (2006-2008). Excavators selected dead or unhealthy trees. Secondary cavity-nesters primarily selected cavities that were deep and high on the tree, using live and dead cavity-bearing trees in proportion to their availability. Nonexcavated cavities suitable for birds occurred primarily in live trees. They were most likely to develop in large-diameter trees, especially grapia Apuleia leiocarpa and trees in co-dominant or suppressed crown classes. To conserve cavity-nesting birds of the Atlantic forest, we recommend a combination of policies, economic assistance, environmental education, and technical support for forest managers and small-scale farmers, to maintain large healthy and unhealthy trees in commercial logging operations and on farms.

AB Studies that assess the importance of riparian habitats in maintaining diversity of herpetofaunal assemblages in tropical dry forests are limited. We examined changes in abundance, diversity and composition of anuran, lizard and snake assemblages along stream edge-upslope gradients in conserved and disturbed areas of tropical dry forest on the Pacific coast of Mexico. We sampled 659 plots in six watersheds over 2 yr. Two forest conditions (conserved and human disturbed, with three watersheds as replicates) were evaluated in the dry and rainy season. Within each watershed, plots were randomly located at three different distance categories from either stream edge: 0-10 m (near-stream environment), 30-40 m (mid-slope environment), and 50-60 m (upslope environment). Herpetofauna was surveyed by time-constrained searches with a sampling effort of 1980 person-hours. Eighteen anuran, 18 lizard and 23 snake species were recorded. Overall, abundance and diversity of lizards and snakes decreased from near-stream to upslope areas in both forest conditions and seasons; while that of anurans followed this trend only for the conserved forest during the rainy season. Regardless of distance, abundance and diversity of anurans markedly decreased during the dry season, while that of snakes and lizards increased. Overall, our study shows that the importance of riparian areas for herpetofaunal conservation in dry tropical forests varies with forest condition and season.

AB Guaiacum sanctum and Guaiacum coulteri are long-lived Mesoamerican timber tree species heavily exploited throughout their range and considered to be at risk of extinction. Both species are included on the IUCN Red List and on CITES Appendix II, but there has been no formal assessment of the conservation status of either species. We used ecological niche modeling and rapid assessments of local density and population size structure to provide such evaluations. For the year 2000, we estimated geographic range sizes for G. sanctum and G. coulteri of 95,422 and 130,973 km2, respectively. The main core remaining habitat for G. sanctum occurs in Campeche State (Yucatan Peninsula), where populations exhibit high adult abundance and profuse regeneration. Several areas along the Mexican Pacific coast remain with suitable habitat for G. coulteri. Guaiacum coulteri is at greater risk as only 1.3 percent of its current habitat is protected, which contrasts with the 13.2 percent of current habitat protected for G. sanctum. We projected that available habitat for G. sanctum and G. coulteri will decline by a further 30-50 percent by 2020 if estimated habitat loss rates continue. We suggest that under the IUCN criteria, the conservation status of G. sanctum and G. coulteri should be updated to near threatened and vulnerable, respectively. Additionally, we conclude that the amount of protected habitat needs to be increased to safeguard both species. Our study provides a quantitative basis for updating the conservation status of both species and illustrates an assessment framework that could be applied to other threatened tree species.

AB Commercial timber harvesting results in the loss of critical habitat for tropical forest fauna, and large-bodied frugivores (including chimpanzees and most other apes) may experience particularly detrimental effects. Few quantitative data, however, are available to evaluate the long-term impact of harvesting on chimpanzees and other apes. In particular, few data are available to compare population demographics and/or forest composition before and after timber harvesting at the same site. Utilizing detailed forestry department records of logging operations conducted in the late 1960s, present-day botanical surveys, and long-term data on the feeding ecology of chimpanzees in Kibale National Park (KNP), Uganda, I examined the impact that logging has had on KNP chimpanzee communities of known size and demography. Although some important chimpanzee food resources were harvested in high abundance during commercial logging operations, the overall impact on the most predominant dietary items (those making up roughly 75% of the chimpanzees' diet) and on presumably critical subsistence resources was limited. Furthermore, the low density of chimpanzees inhabiting the logged region of KNP is apparently not attributable to the impact of logging at the site: comparisons of resource densities at this 'low-chimpanzee-density' site with that of an unlogged and 'high-chimpanzee-density' KNP site did not differ when logging concessions at the low-chimpanzee-density site were excluded from the analysis. This study suggests that low-intensity logging can be compatible with the conservation of large-bodied frugivores, provided that dietary data are taken into account in forest management planning.

AB Understory herbs are an essential part of tropical rain forests, but little is known about factors limiting their reproduction. Many of these herbs are clonal, patchily distributed, and produce large floral displays of nectar-rich 1-d flowers to attract hummingbird pollinators that may transport pollen over long distances. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of clonality, cross-proximity, and patchy distribution on the reproduction of the hummingbird-pollinated Amazonian herb Heliconia metallica. We experimentally pollinated flowers within populations with self-pollen and with pollen of different diversity, crossed flowers between populations, and added supplemental pollen to ramets growing solitarily or in conspecific patches. Only flowers pollinated early in the morning produced seeds. Selfed flowers produced seeds, but seed number and mass were strongly reduced, suggesting partial sterility and inbreeding depression after selfing. Because of pollen competition, flowers produced more seeds after crosses with several than with single donor plants. Crosses between populations mostly resulted in lower seed production than those within populations, suggesting outbreeding depression. Ramets in patches produced fewer seeds than solitary ramets and were more pollen-limited, possibly due to geitonogamy and biparental inbreeding in patches. We conclude that high rates of geitonogamy due to clonality and pollen limitation due to the short receptivity of flowers and patchy distribution constrain the reproduction of this clonal herb. Even in unfragmented rain forests with highly mobile pollinators, outbreeding depression may be a widespread phenomenon in plant reproduction.

AB This case study examines the pollen dispersal distance, pollen dispersal patterns and intra-family genetic structure for isolated trees in pastures of the bat-pollinated Neotropical tree species Hymenaea stigonocarpa using six microsatellite loci and parentage analysis. The sampling included 28 grouped trees (referred to as the population) and six isolated trees in pastureland along a highway in Mato Grosso do Sul State, Brazil. From the population, we sampled 137 seeds from 12 seed-trees, and from the isolated trees, we sampled 34 seeds from two seed-trees. The results showed that pollen was dispersed over long distances (reaching 7353 m) and therefore the spatially isolated trees were not reproductively isolated. The pollen immigration rate in the population was also high (31%). Isolated trees presented a higher selfing rate (s=26%) than trees in the population (s=12%), suggesting that the spatial isolation of the trees increased selfing. However, selfing was responsible for only 30 percent of the inbreeding in offspring and mating among relatives was 70 percent. In the population, excluding selfing, ca 72 percent of the pollen was dispersed over distances < 1000 m (average: 860 m). For the two isolated seed-trees, excluding selfing, the average pollen dispersal distance was 5229 m. The results demonstrate that although pollen can be dispersed over long distances for H. stigonocarpa isolated trees, a high percentage of pollen comes from the same tree (selfing) and mating was correlated. Consequently, seeds must be collected from a large number of seed-trees for conservation purposes.

AB Ideas on the spatial variation of biodiversity often imply a causal link between the abundance and species richness of organisms. We investigated this 'more individuals hypothesis' using light-trapping data of three unrelated groups of moths (Arctiidae, Geometridae and Pyraloidea) from the Ecuadorian Andes. We analyzed environmental correlates of specimen densities found in different habitats, finding effects of temperature, moonlight, forest succession, elevation and season. We corrected abundance data for light-trapping artefacts, and we measured species diversity with various metrics known to be unbiased by undersampling. We found significant positive correlations between abundance and species diversity for all three taxonomic groups. We discuss implications for a general evaluation of species-energy theory as well as for a better understanding of ecological processes in montane habitats of the Andes.

AB In much of the tropics, the gray literature-published by nongovernmental organizations, governments, intergovernmental organizations, consultancies, private companies, and individuals-has a greater volume than the peer-reviewed scientific literature in ecology and conservation. I discuss why this is a problem in terms of quality, discovery, access, and archiving. Unpublished dissertations and theses are another vast untapped source of information in tropical biology. Internet search engines can potentially integrate access to all information sources, but only if the producers of gray literature and theses greatly improve electronic access. Digital repositories can provide both this accessibility and permanent archiving.

AB This paper reports a study on species richness and composition of Tumbesian dry forest communities. We tested two alternative hypotheses about species assemblage processes in tropical dry forests: (1) species assemblage is determined by the filtering effect of environmental conditions and (2) species assemblage is determined by facilitative processes along the gradient of water availability, and thus, species richness and evenness increase as water becomes limited. In addition, we also explored the effect of climate and soil conditions on species composition in tropical dry forests. Species composition was sampled in 109 plots in terms of cover and tree diameter at breast height. Climatic, edaphic, topographic and anthropogenic degradation variables were obtained for each plot. We used generalized linear models and canonical correspondence analyses to evaluate the effect of environmental variables on species composition, richness and evenness. Water availability negatively affected richness and significantly determined the species assemblage. Species richness increased from ridges to valleys and evenness increased at higher altitudes. Soil characteristics showed no effect on richness and evenness but soil moisture, nitrogen concentration and soil temperature explained significant fractions of species composition. Although timber extraction and livestock in our study area were of low intensity, it negatively affected richness but had only a minor effect on species composition. Our results suggest that species composition in these endangered tropical dry forests may be at least partially explained by the stress-gradient hypothesis, with higher species richness at drier conditions probably induced by facilitation processes.

AB The strength of competitive and facilitative interactions in plant communities is expected to change along resource gradients. Contrasting theoretical models predict that with increasing abiotic stress, facilitative effects are higher, lower, or similar than those found under more productive conditions. While these predictions have been tested in stressful environments such as arid and alpine ecosystems, they have hardly been tested for more productive African woodlands. We experimentally assessed the strength of tree seedling facilitation by nurse trees in mesic and dry woodlands in Benin, West Africa. We planted seedlings of the drought-sensitive Afzelia africana and the drought-tolerant Khaya senegalensis under three microsite conditions (closed woodland, woodland gap, and open fields). Seedling survival was greater within woodlands compared with open fields in both the mesic and dry woodlands. The relative benefits in seedling survival were larger at the dry site, especially for the drought-sensitive species. Nevertheless, plant interactions became neutral or negative during the dry season in the drier woodland, indicating that the net positive effects may be lost under very stressful abiotic conditions. We conclude that facilitation also occurs in the relatively more productive conditions of African woodlands. Our results underscore the role of environmental variation in space and time, and the stress tolerance of species, in explaining competitive and facilitative interactions within plant communities.

ID TREE-RING ANALYSIS; SOUTH-AMERICA; PATTERNS; RECORD
AB In this study, we use tree-ring records to determine the climate factors controlling the growth of Centrolobium microchaete, a high-value timber species from the tropical dry Chiquitano forest in Bolivia. We present the first tree-ring chronologies from C. microchaete for Concepcion and Santa Monica, Bolivia. Statistical analyses show that the chronologies are of good quality and have a significant common signal between trees. The growth of C. microchaete is strongly influenced by climatic conditions during late spring-early summer. Abundant precipitations concurrent with below-average temperatures during this period of the year favor tree growth. Climate variations in late spring-early summer explain > 40 percent of the total variance in C. microchaete tree growth during the interval 1943-2005. Minor differences in tree responses to climate recorded between the two stands may reflect differences in the extent of the dry season and in soil water capacity between sites. Although the chronologies cover the past 180 yr, adding samples from older individuals would permit the extension of these records further back in time. The strong climate dependency of tree growth suggests that predicted future climate changes in the region could have a significant influence on C. microchaete tree growth during the 21st century.

AB Classic niche partitioning suggests that coexistence among asymmetric competitors is facilitated by differential resource use. Coexistence is also possible, however, when a species only has access to resources that are shared with a competitor, providing it is the superior competitor on that resource (the 'included niche'). To test predictions of these two coexistence mechanisms, we studied habitat selection of two closely related sympatric plant-specialist frogs from Madagascar (Guibemantis bicalcaratus and Guibemantis punctatus). Both species live and breed only in the water-filled leaf axils of Pandanus plants, and previous experiments with their tadpoles demonstrated asymmetric competition. In a 3-yr field study, we: (1) monitored the biotic and abiotic conditions of 348 plants; (2) surveyed these plants for frogs; (3) undertook a mark-recapture study; and (4) conducted an experiment where we manipulated the amount of detritus in plants. We identified several differences in the conditions of the habitats selected by both species (e.g., plant height, canopy cover over the plant, abundance of heterospecifics). Co-occurrence was nevertheless common, and G. punctatus persisted almost exclusively in plants it shared with G. bicalcaratus. As predicted by theory, G. punctatus was the superior competitor, at least in the tadpole stage. The inferior competitor (G. bicalcaratus) had access to exclusive resources not available to G. punctatus, by virtue of a faster developmental rate that permitted reproduction in lower quality plants. While there was some evidence of weak niche partitioning, we conclude that coexistence in these plant-specialist frogs is primarily via an included niche mechanism.

AB Multispecies agro-forestry is generally lauded for providing ecosystem services, especially in tropical environments. Avian communities contribute to services such as biodiversity and pest management. Characterizing and evaluating avian community composition in similar cropping systems will help optimize management for ecosystem services. We examined the relationship between cropping system vegetation and avian communities in four shaded agro-forestry systems common to the Limon province of Costa Rica: abandoned and managed systems of cacao, cacao with banana, and banana. During two field seasons, we detected 2605 birds from 106 species and identified 2791 trees and shrubs from 62 morphospecies. We compared vegetation and avian species richness across systems with mixed-effects linear models. Canopy, understory, and groundcover vegetation differed among agro-forestry systems. More ground- and understory-foraging forest species were detected in agro-forestry systems lacking banana, whereas richness of agricultural generalist species was highest in systems with banana. Richness of understory- and ground-foraging species correlated with understory tree species richness and leaf litter. Our results indicate that shaded cacao and banana systems can have similar canopy-foraging species richness that includes both agricultural and woodland generalist species, but that interspersing banana with cacao can adversely influence understory forest bird community composition. Agro-forests with diverse understory vegetation support more understory-foraging bird species that have proven valuable in pest management.

AB The Janzen-Connell hypothesis proposes that density dependent seed and seedling mortality, combined with increasing seed and seedling survival away from the parent tree, together promote regular spacing of species and thus alpha diversity. This hypothesis has rarely been tested in tropical Africa, and rarely in montane forests anywhere. We tested this hypothesis using a combination of field experiments and observations in the most floristically diverse dry submontane forest in Nigeria. We investigated distance effects on seedling herbivory, seedling survival and seedling height growth. We found a significant decrease in herbivory with distance from conspecific adult trees for all three species of experimentally planted seedlings (Entandrophragma angolense, Deinbollia pinnata and Sterculia setigera), and also for naturally occurring seedlings of Pouteria altissima but not of Newtonia buchananii or Isolona pleurocarpa. The relative density of large seedlings/saplings of P. altissima, N. buchananii and I. pleurocarpa increased significantly at greater distance from conspecific adult trees; however, we found no significant distance effect on survival or height growth over 3 mo for all three experimentally planted species. Taken together, our results are some of the first to show that Janzen-Connell effects occur on the African continent and in particular montane tropical forest and suggest that such effects may be pantropical.

This study (1) investigated how termite species density, abundance, functional group diversity and termite attack on dead wood vary with altitude along an Amazon-Andes altitudinal gradient in Peru; (2) identified likely environmental causes of this pattern; and (3) explored the implications of termite presence for ecosystem functioning (notably for decomposition). Termites were sampled with a standardized 100 x 2 m straight-belt transect at five undisturbed forest sites along a gradient 190 to 3025 m, as were environmental variables and termite and fungus attack on dead wood. Termite diversity was similar to that found at comparable sites in South America, and there was little turnover of assemblage composition with elevation suggesting that montane specialists are not present. Termite diversity declined with increased elevation, though the upper distribution limit for termites was at a lower elevation than anticipated. We suggest that key drivers of this elevation pattern are reduced temperature with altitude and mid-elevation peaks in soil water content. Also, attack on dead wood diminished with decreasing termite indirect absolute abundance, while the depth of the soil humic layer increased. We hypothesize that termite abundance is a major accelerant of decomposition rates (and associated mineralization) in Amazonian forests.

AB Dietary proteins are considered crucial for growth and maintenance in mammals, but many fruit-eating mammals feed largely on a protein-poor diet. In the Chiroptera, frugivory has evolved twice, in the Old World Pteropodidae and in the New World Phyllostomidae, especially the Stenodermatinae. Recent studies based on the analysis of nitrogen isotope ratios (delta 15N) suggest that phyllostomids feed to varying degrees on arthropods to meet their nitrogen (N) requirements. Arthropod feeding has rarely been observed in Pteropodidae. Thus, we asked whether pteropodids meet their N requirements by feeding exclusively on plant matter. We predicted that tissue from pteropodid wing membranes should be depleted in 15N relative to those of obligate insectivorous rhinolophoid, vespertilionid or emballonurid bats, if pteropodids acquire proteins exclusively from fruits, leaves or nectar. We found that delta 15N in pteropodids were significantly lower than in obligate insectivorous bats. In addition, mean delta 15N of Old World pteropodids was similar to that of obligate frugivorous stenodermatines of the New World tropics. We infer from these data that pteropodids are predominantly phytophagous bats. From a nutritional perspective, pteropodids and stenodermatines are very similar, suggesting that they share convergent physiological adaptations to compensate for the lack of dietary nitrogen.

AB For all its positive attributes, the recent expansion of ecotourism has resulted in greater influxes of people into natural areas, causing a range of impacts including behavioral disruptions among wildlife. How animals respond to conversation is poorly understood, but noise reduction may reduce the impact of ecotourists while simultaneously enhancing their experience with higher wildlife encounter rates. We tested the response of a rain forest bird community to noise by playing a recorded conversation while conducting point censuses in a terra firme forest in Tambopata, Peru. Fifty decibel conversation (approximately library speaking volume) caused declines of 35 percent in total detections and 33 percent in detected species richness. Birds reacted similarly to 60 dB (approximately the volume of an excited child): average detections declined by 39 percent and detected species richness by 37 percent. Specifically, noise-induced detection declines were manifest both in decreased vocalizations (37% decline) and decreased physical sightings (44% decline). Lowered detection frequencies indicate behavioral shifts. As vocalization is involved in territory defense, breeding behavior, and predator detection, strong noise responsiveness indicates potential harm for birds. Insectivores were the most affected bird guild, raising conservation concerns, as insectivorous birds are sensitive to habitat modification. Birds reacted strongly to noise both near an established ecotourist lodge and in an intact reserve, indicating an absence of habituation. Thus, as a method for reducing ecotourism's footprint on native fauna and improving tourist satisfaction with increased wildlife sightings, noise reduction seems promising, even for well-established ecotourist lodges.

AB In a recent article in this journal Zhang and colleagues investigated the factors affecting the distribution of a species of epiphytic fern Asplenium nidus L. in rain forest in Peninsular Malaysia. Here we suggest that their findings may be interpreted in the light of there being two cryptic species present, each with different ecologies, as is the case in Malaysian Borneo. We also discuss the implications of the existence of cryptic species when attempting to conserve forest diversity in the face of climate change and habitat conversion.

AB Because most invertebrate seed predators are host-specific, they are usually expected to produce Janzen-Connell patterns. This expectation was fulfilled for Astrocaryum but not for Allagoptera, depending on the effects of bruchine and scolytine predators on the seeds of these palms. Thus, the mere existence of invertebrate predation is not sufficient for generating Janzen-Connell; what matters is seed mortality, which varies between predators and between plant species for the same predator.

AB Analyses relating long-term records of tree growth to interannual climatic variation at La Selva, Costa Rica have revealed marked forest sensitivities to both temperature and dry-season intensity (Clark et al. 2010). The tropical-forest biome is certain to become warmer, and many areas may become drier. Testing the generality of the La Selva findings with similar analyses of field data from diverse forests across the biome will be a valuable next step. Based on our experiences during the La Selva studies, we propose that such assessments will need to address three issues. One is the number of repeat forest measurements. Short series of re-censuses can be an unreliable basis for assessing climatic sensitivities. For some key climatic factors (e.g., temperature), records consisting of fewer than 10-12 re-censuses can span limited climatic ranges, producing erratic and largely nonsignificant correlations. Multiyear census intervals exacerbate these data limitations. Second, different types of forest-growth data call for different analysis approaches. Cohort and tree-ring records need to be adjusted for ontogenetic growth changes, while stand-level data require taking into account potentially confounding influences from forest compositional changes, as from succession. Third, a reliable meteorological record is critical. Poor-quality or internally inconsistent climatic records can fatally corrupt assessments of forest sensitivities. To be usable in such analyses, the meteorological record requires data quality control, gap filling, and adjustments to maintain the record's internal consistency in the face of commonly occurring methods changes (instruments, siting). We illustrate these issues using analyses of the long-term La Selva records.

AB Taxillus tomentosus is a mistletoe of significant management concern in southern India. This mistletoe affects the productivity of several nontimber forest products, most significantly Amla (Phyllanthus emblica and Phyllanthus indofischeri), whose fruits provide an important source of income for indigenous forest communities. Management interventions are required to secure the continued viability of Amla and thereby its role in livelihoods. To enhance the scientific basis for management, we characterized the distribution of T. tomentosus at three scales, examined potential mechanisms underlying this distribution, and compared both with those documented in other habitats. Mistletoes were aggregated at all three scales: on individual trees, within forest plots of 500 m2, and at scales of 3-4 km. Seed deposition patterns provide an initial distribution 'template' that largely determines patterns at tree and plot scales. This initial pattern is subsequently altered as variation in host suitability and mistletoe mortality from forest fires influence establishment success and postestablishment survival. Local prevalence of infection contributed most to infection spread, and areas of high infection prevalence are highlighted as appropriate foci for management intervention. Although novel underlying mechanisms and variation in the scale of aggregation have been identified, mistletoe distribution in a tropical forest appears to be shaped by similar forces as those documented previously in temperate systems.

AB Dung beetles fulfill several key functions in ecosystems but their role as secondary seed dispersers is probably one of the most complex ones. Various factors, such as seed characteristics, dispersal pattern induced by the primary disperser, season, and habitat, can affect the seed-beetle interaction. Particularly little is known about the fate of seeds primarily dispersed in small feces. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of these factors on the dung beetle community (species composition, number and size of individuals) and its consequences on burial occurrence and depth of seeds primarily dispersed by two tamarin species. We captured dung beetles in a Peruvian rain forest with 299 dung-baited pitfall traps to characterize the dung beetle community. Seed burial occurrence and depth were assessed by marking in situ 551 dispersed seeds in feces placed in cages. Among these seeds, 22.5 percent were buried by dung beetles after 2 d. We observed a significant effect of the amount of dung, season, time of deposition, and habitat on the number of individuals and species of dung beetles, as well as on seed burial occurrence and depth, while the tamarin species significantly influenced only the number and the size of dung beetles. This seed dispersal loop is particularly important for forest regeneration: small to large seeds dispersed by tamarins in secondary forest can be buried by dung beetles. These seeds can thus benefit from a better protection against predation and a more suitable microenvironment for germination, potentially enhancing seedling recruitment.

AB Invasions by introduced ant species can be ecologically destructive and affect a wide range of taxa, particularly native ants. Invasive ant species often numerically dominate ant communities and outperform native ant species in effective resource acquisition. Here, we describe interactions between the invasive ant Anoplolepis gracilipes (Smith) and resident ant species in disturbed habitats in NE Borneo. We measured interference competition abilities of A. gracilipes by performing arena bioassays between two A. gracilipes colonies and seven local ant species, and measured its effective resource competition at baits within supercolonies and at supercolony boundaries. Furthermore, we compared ant species diversity and composition at baits among (A) core areas of A. gracilipes supercolonies, (B) supercolony boundaries and (C) outside supercolonies. Anoplolepis gracilipes was behaviorally dominant over most ant species except Oecophylla smaragdina. Within supercolonies, A. gracilipes discovered all food baits first, and monopolized the vast majority throughout the course of the experiment. At supercolony boundaries, A. gracilipes discovered baits later than resident ant species, but subsequently monopolized half of the baits. Furthermore, the activity and diversity of the ant community within A. gracilipes supercolonies was lower than at its boundaries and outside supercolonies, and the ant communities differed significantly between infested and noninfested areas. Our study supports the hypothesis that successful establishment of A. gracilipes in anthropogenically disturbed habitats may negatively affect resident ant communities through high levels of direct interspecific aggression and almost complete monopolization of resources within high-density supercolonies.

AB Heliconia uxpanapensis (Heliconiaceae) is an outcrossing endemic herb that grows within continuous and fragmented areas of the tropical rain forest of southeast Veracruz (Mexico). The genetic diversity, population differentiation, and genetic structure of seven populations of the studied species were assessed using inter-simple sequence repeat) markers. Population differentiation was moderately high (F-ST range: 0.18-0.22) and indirect estimates of gene flow were rather low (Nm=0.65-0.83). Analysis of molecular variance indicated that the populations explained 22.2 percent of the variation, while individuals within the populations accounted for 77.8 percent. The similar and high level of genetic diversity found within populations of the continuous and fragmented forest suggests that H. uxpanapensis has not suffered yet the expected negative effect of fragmentation. Genetic structure analyses indicated the presence of fewer genetic clusters (K=4) than populations (N=7). Three of the four fragmented forest populations were assigned each to one of the clusters found within the continuous forest, suggesting the absence of a negative fragmentation effect on the amount and distribution of genetic variation. Given the significant genetic structure combined with high genetic diversity and low levels of gene flow, theoretical simulations indicated that H. uxpanapensis might be highly susceptible to changes in the mating system, which promotes inbreeding within fragmented populations. Thus, future conservation efforts in this species should be directed to ensure that levels of gene flow among populations are sufficient to prevent an increment in the magnitude of inbreeding within fragments.

AB Neutral ecological theory comes in two flavors-a two-stage model with space implicit and a spatially explicit version. Reconciliation of the two flavors has proven problematic. Panmixis, an implicit assumption of the two-stage model, is neither realistic for nor supported by tropical forest trees. However, in spatially explicit versions, stochastic species input in local communities is still necessary to retain high species richness. A unified theory of biodiversity must include both stochasticity and relevant ecological mechanisms.

AB Many experimental studies show that a decline in species number has a negative effect on ecosystem function, however less is known about this pattern in natural communities. We examined the relative importance of environment, space, and diversity on ecosystem function, specifically tree carbon storage in four plant types (understory/canopy; trees/palms), in a tropical forest in central Panama. The objectives of this study were to detect the relationship between tree diversity and carbon storage given the environmental and spatial variation that occur in natural forests and to determine which species diversity measure is more important to tree carbon storage: richness or dominance. We used redundancy analyses to partition the effect of these sources of variation on tree carbon storage. We showed that together, environment, space, and diversity accounted for 43 percent of tree carbon storage, where diversity (19%) alone is the most important source of variation and explained more variation than space (13%) and environment (1%) together. Therefore, even in natural forests where substantial environment and spatial variation can be found, it is still possible to detect the effect of diversity on ecosystem function at scales relevant to conservation. Moreover, both richness and dominance are important to explain the variation on tree carbon storage in natural forests suggesting that these two diversity measures are complementary. Thus, tree diversity is important to predict tree carbon storage in hyperdiverse forests.

AB Invasive species interacting with fires pose a relatively unknown, but potentially serious, threat to the tropical forests of Hawaii. Fires may create conditions that facilitate species invasions, but the degree to which this occurs in different tropical plant communities has not been quantified. We documented the survival and establishment of plant species for 2 yr following 2003 wildfires in tropical moist and wet forest life zones in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, Hawaii. Fires were ignited by lava flows and burned across a steep environmental gradient encompassing two previously burned shrub-dominated communities and three Metrosideros polymorpha forest communities. Fires in all community types were stand replacing, where >95 percent of overstory trees were top killed. Over half (>57%) of the trees survived via basal sprouting, but sprout growth differed among forest communities. Sprout growth (4250,000 cm(3)) was greatest in the forest community where postfire understory cover was lowest presumably due to thick native Dicranopteris linearis fern litter that remained postfire. In contrast, M. polymorpha sprout growth was much slower (<100,000 cm(3)) in the two forest communities where there was rapid understory recovery of nonnative ferns Nephrolepis multiflora and invasive grassesPaspalum conjugatum. These results suggest that the rapid establishment of an invasive-dominated understory limited recovery of the overstory dominant M. polymorpha. In contrast to the three forest communities, there were few changes in vegetation composition in the shrubland communities. Nonnative species invasions coupled with repeated fires selectively eliminated fire-sensitive species thereby maintaining these communities in dominance of primarily nonnative, fire-resilient, species.

AB The life history of figs (Ficus, Moraceae) involves pollination by specialized insects and seed dispersal by vertebrate frugivores. This three-way interaction raises the possibility of conflict between pollinators and seed dispersers over fig resources. The conflict might be mediated in dioecious figs by the segregation of inflorescences with specialized male and female sexual functions, termed gall figs and seed figs, on separate trees. In dioecious figs, pollinators are intimately associated with gall figs, whereas vertebrate frugivores prefer seed figs and disperse the seeds they contain. Optimal foraging theory predicts that frugivore preference for ripe seed figs is associated with superior nutritional quality when compared to gall figs. We tested this prediction comparing nutrient and mineral properties of ripe figs in 12 functionally dioecious and two monoecious species from New Guinea. Analyses of variance indicated that gall figs contain more fiber and minerals, whereas seed figs contain significantly more carbohydrates and fat. Fruit bats, the primary dispersers of dioecious figs in New Guinea, prefer carbohydrate-rich diets, and from this perspective, seed figs offer a greater nutritional reward than gall figs. More nondigestible fiber in gall figs than seed figs would appear to discourage frugivory. Parallel differences between ripe gall figs and seed figs occur in each independent dioecious lineage whereas nutritional content in monoecious figs is more similar to seed figs. This suggests that sexual dimorphism in nutritional quality might be adaptive and associated with the maintenance of functional dioecy in figs.

AB This study was designed to explicitly formulate the effect of census interval and plot size on the variability of descriptors of tropical forest structure (stand density, basal area, aboveground biomass [AGB]) and dynamic (tree growth, mortality and recruitment rates, biomass fluxes). A unique dataset from a broad plot network (37.5 ha) surveyed every 2 yr over a 16-yr period was used to develop and parameterize a new statistical model predicting the coefficients of variation for each forest descriptor. More than 90 percent of the inherent variability of these coefficients was predicted using a simple model including plot size and census interval in a Bayesian modeling framework. All descriptors of forest structure varied by <10 percent for plot sizes 42 ha. Among the descriptors of forest dynamics, AGB loss was the most variable. The number of 6.25 ha plots required to estimate its mean, over a 16-yr period, within a 20 percent error of the mean remains above four. This contrasts with a relative constant flux of biomass entering the plot through tree growth and tree recruitment. Tree growth was remarkably well estimated with <15 percent variability for a 2-yr census in a plot of 2 ha. This study provides an easy method to assess dataset limitations in efforts to estimate descriptors of forest structure and dynamic, which is of primary importance to decipher any clear consequences of global change in tropical forests.

AB We investigated the effect of local hunting on plant recruitment at the community level in the Ngotto Forest, Central African Republic. It is the first study of this kind in the afrotropics. To compare our results with previous studies conducted in the neotropics, we used the protocol proposed by Nunez-Iturri and Howe. We compared animal relative abundances and seed length, density and diversity of seedlings at two sites with contrasting anthropogenic pressures: one with low hunting pressure (LH) and one with high hunting pressure (HH). Furthermore, we investigated how density and diversity of recruitment vary with seed length in the two sites. Both sites exhibit similar soil, climate and tree species composition, and have never been logged. Large mammals (frugivores and herbivores) were extirpated from HH and relative abundance of medium-sized frugivores drastically decreased in HH compared with LH. In HH, diversity of seedlings was reduced compared with LH, especially for large-seeded plant species dispersed by large game mammals. The approach used in this study shows promising perspectives to investigate the effects of human disturbances on the regeneration of tropical forests. Furthermore, in the afrotropical context of a lack of data on plant-animal ecological relationships, seed length appears to be a good predictor of the strength of the deficit of plant recruitment due to large mammal extirpation because of hunting. Thus, more efforts are needed to study the ecological roles of large-seeded plants in order to better understand the effects of their disappearance on tropical forest resilience.

AB Lowland Amazon is climatically one of the least seasonal regions on the planet, but little is known about how this is reflected in ecological seasonality. The central objective of this study was to determine whether seasonal fluctuations in the availability of fruit resources in Neotropical forests are sufficiently marked to affect the ecology and physiology of frugivorous bats. Seasonal variations in the overall bat abundance and in the captures, body condition, and reproductive activity of the two most abundant species, Carollia perspicillata and Artibeus planirostris, were studied within a region of central Brazilian Amazonia dominated by a mosaic of nonflooded (terra firme) and seasonally flooded forests (varzea and igapo). Concurrent seasonal changes in fruit availability were measured. The abundance of fruits was markedly seasonal, with far fewer resources available during the low-water season. There was a positive correlation between fruit and bat abundance. Overall, bats did not increase the consumption of arthropods during the period of fruit shortage. In A. planirostris, the body condition declined when fruits were scarcer. In both C. perspicillata and A. planirostris, foraging and reproductive activity were positively correlated with fruit availability. Consequently, the results suggest that resource seasonality is sufficiently marked to affect frugivorous bats and force them to make important eco-physiological adjustments.

AB Habitat complexity is an important factor structuring local faunal assemblages. Many invasive plant species alter vegetation complexity because they are both functionally and structurally different from native flora. This study investigated the effects of an invasive grass (Andropogon gayanus Kunth.), which is invading undisturbed savannas in northern Australia. Although A. gayanus is a similar lifeform to that dominant in the native understory (i.e., a C4 grass), it is structurally different and significantly alters habitat complexity. We, therefore, hypothesized that there would be a substantial effect of the invasive grass on ant, spider, and other invertebrate assemblages. Contrary to our hypothesis, there was no effect of A. gayanus on ant species richness, abundance, or composition, nor were spiders or other invertebrates affected. Instead the change in weather conditions with season was more important in structuring the local invertebrate assemblages. Change in habitat complexity was most pronounced vertically, rather than horizontally at ground level, thus although there was a clear difference in the vertical structure between invaded and noninvaded habitats, the limited invertebrate response to different A. gayanus densities suggests some invertebrates are less sensitive to vertical changes in vegetation structure.

AB Predicting responses of vegetation to environmental factors in human-altered tropical ecosystems requires an understanding of the controls on plant population expansion across landscapes (i.e., long-distance dispersal) as well as of factors affecting recruitment at local scales (i.e., microsite conditions). We studied the roles of light availability, habitat type, soil disturbance, and seed dispersal in a selectively logged forest in lowland Bolivia where the exotic forage grass Urochloa (Panicum) maxima is abundant on roads and log landings but does not invade felling gaps or unlogged forest. Shade-house trials and seed addition experiments with U. maxima revealed that this C(4) grass thrives in high light but also grows in partial shade (10% full sun, but not 1% full sun), and that felling gaps, but not undisturbed forest, are suitable for grass establishment. To determine if seed dispersal by logging vehicles explains the discrepancy between actual and potential grass recruitment sites, we collected grass seeds that fell from trucks onto log landings located long distances (4500 m) from established grass populations. Trucks dispersed an estimated 1800 alien grass seeds per log landing during the early dry season; automobiles also transported seeds of grass (135 seeds/vehicle). The seeds collected (and relative abundances) were the exotics U. (Panicum) maxima (97%) and Urochloa (Brachiaria) brizantha (2%), and the pan-tropical weeds Sorghum halapense (1%) and Rottboellia cochinchinensis (0.2%). Grasses invade this forest where disturbance coincides with seed dispersal by motor vehicles, while dispersal limitation apparently prevents invasion of many sites otherwise suitable for grass recruitment (i.e., felling and natural gaps).

AB Suspended soils in forest canopies are thought to harbor a substantial fraction of canopy biomass and many arboreal specialists, but do forest floor generalist predators with high vagility also use this habitat? We tested the hypothesis of no difference between forest floor and suspended-soil predatory mite faunas (Acari: Mesostigmata) in an Australian rain forest. Our results show that instead of being habitat generalists, many predatory mites partition soil into two main strata: soil suspended aboveground irrespective of height (0.5-20 m) and soil on the ground. Of 53 species of Mesostigmata in suspended soil, 53 percent (28 species) were absent from or rarely found on the ground. This increased to 60 percent (15/25 species) if only common species are considered. Among these 15 'suspended-soil specialists', all but the three least abundant were found throughout the arboreal strata. Moreover, ten species also occurred in litter accumulated on the surface of decaying logs or boulders close to the forest floor. Thus, although the arboreal predatory mite fauna is distinct from that on the forest floor, it is not restricted to the high canopy: even slightly elevated substrate appears acceptable as habitat for these suspended-soil specialists. Our data suggest that a substantial portion of a rain forest's soil and litter fauna is held above the forest floor.

AB The Atlantic Forest deserves special attention due to its high level of species endemism and degree of threat. As in other tropical biomes, there is little information about the ecology of the organisms that occur there. The objectives of this study were to verify how fruit-feeding butterflies are distributed through time, and the relation with meteorological conditions. Species richness and Shannon index were partitioned additively at the monthly level, and beta diversity, used as a hierarchical measure of temporal species turnover, was calculated among months, trimesters, and semesters. Circular analysis was used to verify how butterflies are distributed along seasons and its relation with meteorological conditions. We sampled 6488 individuals of 73 species. Temporal diversity of butterflies was more grouped than expected by chance among the months of each trimester. Circular analyses revealed that diversity is concentrated in hot months (September-March), with the subfamily Brassolinae strongly concentrated in February-March. Average temperature was correlated with total abundance of butterflies, abundance of Biblidinae, Brassolinae and Morphinae, and richness of Satyrinae. The present results show that 3mo of sampling between September and March is enough to produce a nonbiased sample of the local assemblage of butterflies, containing at least 70 percent of the richness and 25 percent of abundance. The influence of temperature on sampling is probably related to butterfly physiology. Moreover, temperature affects resource availability for larvae and adults, which is higher in hot months. The difference in seasonality patterns among subfamilies is probably a consequence of different evolutionary pressures through time.

AB There have been few reports of invasions in continental rain forests, especially for exotic animals. This study provides original data concerning the potential of exotic drosophilid species to colonize the Amazonian tropical rain forest. To investigate if the structure of drosophilid assemblages differed in response to anthropogenic disturbance, we performed a taxonomic survey at six sites within the Yasuni National Park in Ecuadorian Amazonia along a disturbance gradient from pristine to clearcut artificial forest. A total of 7425 individuals from 34 species were collected of which seven species were exotic. There was significant variation in the assemblage composition along this disturbance gradient; 31 percent of which was explained by the presence of exotic species, particularly at the most disturbed sites, through nonmetric multidimensional scaling and SIMPER analyses. These results confirm the susceptibility of continental rain forests to invasion by exotic species. There is an urgent need to develop and implement monitoring systems, for example, based on drosophilid assemblage surveys, to detect exotic invasions in continental tropical forests.

AB Jaguars (Panthera onca) and pumas (Puma concolor) are sympatric across the entire jaguar range, where they coexist in increasingly fragmented landscapes under threat of persecution mainly in response to livestock predation. Pumas are known to inhabit a greater variety of natural habitats than jaguars, but little is known about the influence of anthropogenic factors on the coexistence of these two similar-sized cats. This study compares habitat use of jaguars and pumas in Belize, Central America, using 1380 jaguar and puma photo captures from 3 yr of camera trapping, comprising 64-74 individual jaguars and an unknown number of pumas. Jaguars and pumas did not differ in their use of a large block of relatively homogenous secondary rain forest. However, pumas were scarce outside this forest block, whereas jaguars were detected throughout the human-influenced landscape. Reasons for this discrepancy may include differential tolerance to human disturbance, and resource limitation for pumas outside the forest block. Intra-specific variation in jaguar activity in the form of sex-dependent habitat use was detected across the landscape. Male jaguars were detected at more locations than female jaguars and more frequently at each location, with a declining difference from a 50-fold greater detection in the protected forest, through forest buffer, savannah, pastures, to negligible difference in the disturbed forest.

AB To protect the remaining biodiversity on tropical islands it is important to predict the elevational ranges of non-native species. We evaluated two hypotheses by examining land snail faunas on the eastern (windward) side of the island of Hawaii: (1) the latitude of a species' native region can be used to predict its potential elevational range and (2) non-native temperate species, which experience greater climatic fluctuations in their native range, are more likely to become established at higher elevations and to extend over larger elevational ranges than non-native tropical species. All non-native tropical species were distributed patchily among sites <= 500m and occupied small elevational ranges, whereas species introduced from temperate regions occupied wide elevational ranges and formed a distinct fauna spanning elevations 500-2000m. Most native land snail species and ecosystems occur >500m in areas dominated by temperate non-native snail and slug species. Therefore, knowing the native latitudinal region of a non-native species is important for conservation of tropical island ecosystems because it can be translated into potential elevational range if those species are introduced. Because temperate species will survive in tropical locales particularly at high elevation, on many tropical islands the last refuges of the native species, preventing introduction of temperate species should be a conservation priority.

AB Protected areas (PAs) on tropical mountains undergo greater forest destruction in their lower altitudes. We compared the extent of forested, nonforested, and fragmented areas between lowland (<1000m asl) and montane zones of the Blue Mountains inside the Blue and John Crow Mountains National Park established in Jamaica in 1993. We found that in 2008, inside the montane zone, only 4 percent of forest was cleared, and forest fragmentation was minimal. In the lowland zone, however, the percentage of forest cleared was seven times as high, and the density of fragments was 11-fold higher. We established twenty-five 0.04 ha lowland plots; ordination of tree species composition in these plots reflected a rainfall gradient, showing that plots on the wetter northern side of the Blue Mountains were floristically different from those on the drier southern side. The conservation value of the remaining lowland forest is high because of its high endemism (18% of species in our plots) and beta diversity. In addition, IUCN Red List data show that about 71 percent of threatened tree species in the Blue Mountains grow in the lowland region, 92 percent of which are endemic. From these findings, we identify a 'protected area hotspot zone', which lies between the PA boundary and the core high-altitude zone, and which should be instituted in IUCN categories I and II PAs.

AB Reliable estimates of great ape abundance are needed to assess distribution, monitor population status, evaluate conservation tactics, and identify priority populations for conservation. Rather than using direct counts, surveyors often count ape nests. The standing crop nest count (SCNC) method converts the standing stock of nests into animal densities using a set of parameters, including nest decay rate. Nest decay rates vary greatly over space and time, and it takes months to calculate a site-specific value. The marked nest count (MNC) method circumvents this issue and only counts new nests produced during a defined period. We compared orangutan densities calculated by the two methods using data from studies in Sumatra and Kalimantan, Indonesia. We show how animal densities calculated using nest counts should be cautiously interpreted when used to make decisions about management or budget allocation. Even with site-specific decay rates, short studies using the SCNC method may not accurately reflect the current population unless conducted at a scale sufficient to include wide-ranging orangutan movement. Density estimates from short studies using the MNC method were affected by small sample sizes and by orangutan movement. To produce reliable results, the MNC method may require a similar amount of effort as the SCNC method. We suggest a reduced reliance on the traditional line transect surveys in favor of feasible alternative methods when absolute abundance numbers are not necessary or when site-specific nest decay rates are not known. Given funding constraints, aerial surveys, reconnaissance walks, and interview techniques may be more cost-effective means of accomplishing some survey goals.

AB Early European naturalists saw Amazonian landscapes as pristine, but modern research has found a complex historical ecology, similar to that of other tropical and temperate regions. Although the pristine myth has been thoroughly debunked, too many biodiversity researchers fail to incorporate historical ecology into their analyses. For a world society out of balance with its natural resource base, careful interpretation is essential to understand trends, including impoverishment of planetary biodiversity. If world society avoids civilizational collapse, parts of Amazonia's historical ecology can contribute to future sustainability and improved survival of its biodiversity.

Support is needed for the makers of the biodiversity map, who are at the nexus of systematics and ecology. Biodiversity mapping should be accompanied by taxon-specific short courses that introduce students to specimen preparation and basic identification skills, fostering strong interactions among ecologists and systematists.

AB In Papua New Guinea, the fate of forests is governed by forest-dwelling tribal societies. A rapidly increasing pace of logging compels us to ask why tribal communities prefer logging to conservation. In the absence of feasible development opportunities, remote communities become quickly enthusiastic about conservation projects, but once an area is opened up to logging few such projects survive. Direct payments to forest owners to cover the costs of missed opportunities for economic development are advocated here to make conservation competitive. A conservation royalty scheme would deliver a higher proportion of the conservation funds to the resource owners than the management-intensive community development projects currently favored. Such an approach requires a profound cultural change within conservation organizations from a 'development aid' approach to one more oriented toward business.

AB Several prominent articles have recently revived the debate on how to advance and reconcile two pressing global issues: conservation of biodiversity, and food production for an increasing human population. These discussions contrast a 'land-sparing/intensive agriculture' strategy with a 'biodiversity-friendly' agriculture approach. We propose that swidden or shifting cultivation should be an important component of the latter approach in the tropics because many swidden systems maintain very high levels of biodiversity while providing livelihood for populations in tropical forest areas worldwide. We suggest further that when many swidden systems are viewed without prejudice and in broader spatial and longer temporal perspectives, the conservationist aspects of the systems become evident.

AB Many conservationists are now convinced that the expansion of the world system of protected areas combined with appropriate levels of biodiversity persistence within human-modified landscapes would drastically mitigate the announced impoverishment of tropical biotas. In this context, an inherent/intrinsic biodiversity ability to persist and recover within human-modified landscapes has emerged as a 'trump card' in the conservation battle, renewing our hope in a more sustainable development of the tropical region. However, this optimistic perspective on the conservation value of human-modified landscapes sounds, a priori, a little unrealistic in face of the current knowledge on the nature of human environments and the spectrum of native species that is likely to persist there. Rather than relying on illusory levels of biodiversity resilience and consequent flexible land-use regulations, our real trump card reposes on a radical and ambitious shift from freely exploited landscapes to strictly managed ones, despite the misleading noise produced by those voices advocating for immediate and almost unlimited access to natural resources. Otherwise, we are condemning future human populations to live in biologically impoverished and fragile environments with limited opportunities for life support.

AB Increasingly, we view nature through a utilitarian lens that leads us to attempt to measure and manage the services that species, habitats and ecosystems provide. Surprisingly, we have tended to consider only the positive values of ecosystems, their ecosystem services. In addition to providing our food and water, Nature also kills us, primarily through disease. If we are to effectively manage the terrestrial Earth, we need to also manage species, habitats and ecosystems so as to minimize such 'ecosystem disservices'. I consider what we know about the spatial pattern of one disservice, pathogen prevalence and how changes in habitat influence it. I consider the effects of habitat changes on pathogen prevalence and, consequently, ecosystem disservices. In the end, we need to weigh both the costs and the benefits of particular ecosystems, habitats and species - to consider the bad with the good. Doing so requires that we learn much more about the biota than we currently know.

AB The United Nations declared 2010 the International Year of Biodiversity. Despite the magnitude of the global crisis of biodiversity loss, its far-reaching consequences to human health remain largely unappreciated. The legacy of the natural world to medicine is profound and its potential to yield new therapeutics and advancements in biomedical science undervalued. The enormity of the global crisis underscores a fundamental truth, one that is seemingly obvious but has been tragically overlooked: Our species does not exist in isolation from the biosphere. Rather, our fate depends on it.

AB We argue that there is not enough science to appropriately support many of the conservation measures currently being proposed, and hence, we cannot be sure of the objectivity of the conservation actions being implemented. The objectivity claimed to be underlying conservation actions is more assumed than real. We also suggest that the approach to conservation is driven more by moral commitments than by tested concepts, and it is further biased by our anthropocentric evaluation of ecological processes and their outcomes. Conservation science is a young subject, which needs to be nourished while it continues to feed on its roots-ecology and evolutionary biology.

The Department of Environment, the organization responsible for biodiversity conservation, has changed its core functions over the years to accommodate its obligations under international conventions and again more recently because of a major economic reform program. The creation of several authorities and agencies has resulted in new challenges but at the same time opened up new opportunities. Despite all these changes, the government, with the support of international and local stakeholders, has persevered to safeguard its biodiversity.

As a society, Nature is grossly undervalued relative to other commodities and priorities despite its integral and central role in our psyche and culture. The increasing dissociation of humans from nature, physically, intellectually and culturally, threatens the conservation ethic and all our efforts at conserving Nature in the long term, for human benefit or for its own sake. We need to reverse the increasing human isolation from the natural environment by encouraging our children and the wider public to engage with Nature. The formative experiences thus gained might, with time, change societal priorities in favor of a renewed conservation ethic.

AB Although fire is frequent in African savanna ecosystems and may cause considerable loss of nitrogen (N), N(2)-fixing herbaceous legumes-which could be expected to benefit from low N conditions-are usually not abundant. To investigate possible reasons for this scarcity, we conducted a pot experiment using two common plants of humid African savannas as model species, the legume Cassia mimosoides and the C(4) grass Hyperthelia dissoluta. These species were grown at different levels of water, N and phosphorus (P), both in monoculture and in competition with each other. In the monocultures, yields were significantly increased by the combined addition of N and P in pots receiving high water supply. In pots with interspecific competition, the legume grew poorly unless P was added. Foliar delta 15N values of legume plants grown in mixtures were considerably lower than those in monocultures, suggesting that rates of symbiotic N-fixation were higher in the presence of the grass. Grass delta 15N values, however, were also lower in mixtures, while N concentrations were higher, indicating a rapid transfer of N from the legume to the grass. We conclude that the main reason for the low abundance of C. mimosoides is not low P availability as such, but a greater ability of H. dissoluta to compete for soil N and P, and a much higher N-use efficiency. If other C(4) grasses have a similar competitive advantage, it could explain why herbaceous legumes are generally sparse in African savannas. We encourage others to test these findings using species from other types of savanna vegetation.

AB Wood specific gravity is the single best descriptor of wood functional properties and tree life-history traits, and it is the most important variable in estimating carbon stocks in forests. Tropical pioneer trees produce wood of increasing specific gravity across the trunk radius as they grow in stature. Here, we tested whether radial increases in wood specific gravity were dependent on a tree's diameter or its age by comparing trees of different diameters within cohorts. We cored trunks of four pioneer species in naturally regenerating, even-aged stands in the lowland, wet forests of Costa Rica. For each core, specific gravity was determined for 1-cm radial wood segments, pith to bark. Increases across the radius were evident in all four species studied, and in four different stands for one species. For any given species in a given stand, the rate of radial increase in specific gravity as a function of radial distance from the pith was greater in smaller diameter trees. As the trees in a stand represent a colonizing cohort, these results strongly suggest that the radial increases in specific gravity in lowland pioneers are associated with tree age, not with tree diameter. Furthermore, the specific gravity of the outermost wood was not associated with tree radius, further negating size dependence. One consequence of these results is that species-specific biomass estimates for trees in secondary forests are likely to be confounded by age, as diameter alone may be a poor indicator of specific gravity in individual trees for pioneers of tropical wet forests.

AB Habitat loss and fragmentation is a serious threat to biodiversity. Fragment isolation can be reduced if fragments are connected, either structurally through habitat corridors or functionally if the species can move through the surrounding matrix. One-way to evaluate landscape connectivity is to observe natural movements of animals within fragmented landscapes. The Tana River mangabey (Cercocebus galeritus) is an endangered monkey endemic to fragmented forests along the lower Tana River in Kenya, and who has been observed to move through matrix between fragments. One mangabey group moved through 1 km of matrix, while another group moved through two areas of matrix. I collected behavioral and ranging data on the latter group to describe its behavior and time spent in the matrix. Utilizing data from belt transects in the matrix and forest fragments, I characterized the vegetation structure of the matrix and compared it to the forests included in each group's home range. The group spent the majority of their time eating while in the matrix, and spent an average 36.4 min in one matrix area and 100 min in the other. The matrix is generally characterized by the highest measures for a nonforest attribute and the lowest measures for forest attributes. These results suggest that forest fragments are functionally, but not structurally, connected for the mangabey; a landscape approach to conservation, therefore, should be taken for the lower Tana River. Research investigating the limitations of the mangabey's ability to use the matrix is needed.

AB The agricultural matrix surrounding forested areas serves critical functions as dispersal corridors and alternate habitat for wildlife. Agricultural intensification, however, can reduce the conservation value of these areas. To evaluate the effects of agroecosystem management on bat assemblages, we studied the abundance and diversity of leaf-nosed bats (family: Phyllostomidae) in southwestern Chiapas, Mexico, a landscape dominated by shade coffee agroforestry. During 2104 mist-net hour (MNH), we captured 3167 bats of 27 phyllostomid species. Total species richness in each land-use type varied from 24 species in forest fragments to 22 species in commercial shade polycultures. Although the cumulative observed species richness showed little change in response to management intensity, the number of bats captured per MNH declined significantly in the more intensively managed (i.e., low-shade monocultures) plantations. Intensively managed coffee plantations had lower phyllostomid diversity and species similarity, and had lower proportions of nectarivorous and animalivorous bats. Among frugivores, the proportion of large (> 25 g) frugivores captured increased with management intensity. Recapture frequency was significantly higher than expected in forest fragments, and lower than expected in more intensively managed coffee. Our results suggest that less intensively managed coffee agroforests can serve as valuable feeding and commuting areas for most leaf-nosed bats, and that maintaining forest fragments in agricultural landscapes contributes to bat diversity. Declines in populations of gleaning insectivores, however, could compromise natural suppression of insect pests in these agricultural areas.

AB The highest avian species richness on Earth is found in the Neotropics, with the speciose antbird superfamily (Thamnophilidae, Formicariidae, Grallariidae and Conopophagidae) accounting for 15 percent of South American passerine diversity. Antbird species have divergent life histories and ecological requirements, resulting in considerable interspecific variation in responses to anthropogenic habitat modification. Here, we examine interspecific differences in antbird responses to both habitat fragmentation and perturbation in a region of the so-called 'Arc of Deforestation' of southern Brazilian Amazonia in northern Mato Grosso. We surveyed the antbird community of 31 variable-sized forest patches and found that antbird species richness was predominantly affected by patch size and isolation, although forest patch quality was also important. Life history predictors were less important overall in determining patch occupancy and minimum patch area requirements with body mass and geographic range size the most important predictors. Foraging niche was also important; mixed flock followers, bamboo specialists and army-ant followers were all more prone to local extinction in small fragments. Although most Amazonian antbird species are not currently threatened, rates of interfluvial endemism are high and future forest loss may imperil many species currently considered to be of low conservation concern. Lessons learnt in the identification of fragmentation-sensitive genera and guilds may be applicable to other antbird species outside Amazonia, such as those in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Ensuring future survival of antbirds across neotropical forest landscapes that retain only a small percentage of their original primary forest cover will rest on protecting remaining large forest patches and maintaining structural and functional connectivity between them.

AB A variety of arthropods, particularly insects, have developed myrmecophilous interactions with ants to gain access to resources and/or for protection. Among these myrmecophiles, only a few examples have been documented in the Coccinellidae, most of them involving species able to feed on ant-tended Hemiptera. We report here a new case of obligate myrmecophily in the coccinellid Diomus thoracicus. Larvae are invariably and exclusively found in the nests of the ant Wasmannia auropunctata and seem to rely on ant brood as their only food source. Not only do ant workers show no aggressiveness toward the D. thoracicus larvae in their behavioral interactions at the colonial level, but also at the species level; while coccinellid adults are always attacked. The integration of the larvae inside of the ant nests is based on their chemical mimicry of the host's cuticular cues. Therefore, given the presence of the D. thoracicus larvae inside of the ant's nest, their predation on Wasmannia brood and their chemical mimicry, this species can be considered a specific parasite of W. auropunctata. Overall, this new case of myrmecophily not only specifically involves a highly invasive ant species, but also provides insights into the evolution of myrmecophily and myrmecophagy in coccinellids.

AB Papua New Guinea (PNG) has become the focus of climate change mitigation initiatives such as reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, but defensible estimates of forest carbon are lacking. Here we present a methodology for estimating aboveground forest carbon, and apply it to a large Permanent Sample Plot system maintained by Papua New Guinea Forest Research Institute. We report the first estimates of forest carbon in lowland tropical forest in PNG. Average aboveground carbon in stems > 10 cm diam. for 115 selectively harvested 1-ha plots in lowland tropical forest was 66.3 +/- 3.5 Mg C/ha (95% CI) while for 10 primary forest plots the average was 106.3 +/- 16.2 Mg C/ha. We applied ratios based on field observations, in-country studies, and the literature to estimate unmeasured pools of aboveground carbon (stems < 10 cm diam., fine litter and coarse woody debris). Total aboveground carbon was estimated at 90.2 and 120.8 Mg C/ha in selectively harvested and primary lowland forest, respectively. Our estimate for primary tropical forest is lower than biome averages for tropical equatorial forest, and we hypothesize that frequent disturbances from fire, frost, landslides, and agriculture are limiting carbon stock development. The methodology and estimates presented here will assist the PNG government in its preparedness for mitigation initiatives, are of interest to communities that are seeking to participate in voluntary carbon markets, and will encourage transparency and consistency in the estimation of forest carbon.

AB We examined fine-scale heterogeneity of environmental conditions in a primary rain forest in French Guiana to describe variation in microhabitats that plants may experience during establishment. We characterized both the range as well as the spatial structuring of 11 environmental factors important for seedling establishment in six hexagonal sampling grids, one each in gap and understory sites at three points representing the predominant geomorphic units in this primary forest. Each grid contained 37 sampling points separated by 31 cm-20 m. Monte-Carlo tests of semivariograms against complete spatial randomness indicated that for many variables in all six sampling grids, spatial dependence did not exceed 1 m. A principal component analysis of all sampling points revealed a lack of spatial microhabitat structure, rather than homogeneous patches associated with canopy structure or geomorphology. Our results suggest that ample fine-scale spatial heterogeneity exists to support the coexistence of plant species with differential abiotic requirements for regeneration.

AB We assessed a general hypothesis of tropical tree diversity that predicts that species richness will be positively correlated with stand dynamism. Our analysis was based one of the largest and longest-running datasets on Amazonian trees (>= 10 cm diameter at breast height), with data collected over a 23-yr period within 66 1 ha plots spanning a large (1000 km2) landscape. Within these plots, maximum tree-species richness (329 species/ha) and Fisher's alpha values (227.5) were among the highest ever recorded. Contrary to the diversity-dynamism concept, tree species richness in our landscape was significantly and negatively associated with stand dynamism (measured as the mean rate of annual tree turnover). Because of this unexpected finding, we critically re-evaluated the relationship between stand dynamism and tree diversity across the Amazon basin and the tropics as a whole. With the inclusion of additional data we found that the relationship between stand dynamism and tree diversity becomes non-significant at larger spatial scales.

AB We describe the mesoscale floristic patterns in the central Western Ghats of Karnataka, India, through combined analysis of woody species abundance and stand structure data from a network of ninety-six 1-ha sampling plots spread across 22,000 km2. A total of 61,906 individuals (>= 10 cm gbh) comprising 400 plant species from 254 genera and 75 families were recorded. Euphorbiaceae, Rubiaceae, Lauraceae and Moraceae families constituted 23.5 percent of the total number of species encountered. The relative dominance of species was skewed with Poecilonueron indicum, Xylia xylocarpa, Terminalia tomentosa and Anogeissus latifolia being dominant in some plots. Correspondence analysis (CA) and a nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) of plots by species abundances data showed similar arching patterns, with significant correlation between the first axis of CA and NMDS (r=0.77). Hierarchical clustering of plot scores along the three first CA axes resulted in splitting the plots into five different categories that broadly reflect the major bioclimatic features of the region. A multiscale bootstrapping test indicated that categorization of the wettest (wet evergreen group 1 and 2) and driest (dry deciduous) groups were robust (P < 0.05 with 1000 bootstraps), while the remaining two transitional groups were uncertain (P=0.12 and 0.26 for moist deciduous and semi-evergreen group, respectively). Principal component analysis revealed that plots with similar floristic composition can encompass contrastingly different physiognomic structures (canopy cover, canopy height and mean tree diameter) probably in relation to their levels of disturbance. Observed patterns in the floristic composition have been discussed in the light of the complex interaction between the bioclimatic and disturbance regimes that characterize the region.

AB Several members of the most ancient living lineages of flowering plants (angiosperms) inhabit humid, woody, mostly tropical habitats. Here we assess whether one of these forest types, the cloud forests of Mexico (CFM), contain a relatively higher proportion of phylogenetically early-diverging angiosperm lineages. The CFM houses an extraordinary plant species diversity, including members of earliest-diverging angiosperm lineages. The phylogenetic composition of CFM angiosperm diversity was evaluated through the relative representation of orders and families with respect to the global flora, and the predominance of phylogenetically early- or late-diverging lineages. Goodness-of-fit tests indicated significant differences in the proportional local and global representation of angiosperm clades. The net difference between the percentage represented by each order and family in the CFM and the global flora allowed identification of clades that are overrepresented and underrepresented in the CFM. Early-diverging angiosperm orders and families were found to be neither over- nor underrepresented in the CFM. A slight predominance of late-diverging phylogenetic levels among overrepresented clades, however, was encountered in the CFM. The resulting pattern suggests that cloud forests provide habitats where the most ancient angiosperm lineages have survived in the face of accumulating species diversity belonging to phylogenetically late-diverging lineages.

AB The trajectory of hurricane-induced succession was evaluated in a network of forest plots measured immediately before and 3 mo, 5, 10, and 15 yr after the direct impact of a Category 4 hurricane. Comparisons of forest structure, composition, and aboveground nutrients pools were made through time, and between species, life-history groups and geomorphic settings. The hurricane reduced aboveground biomass by 50 percent, causing an immediate decrease in stem density and diversity indices among all geomorphic settings. After 15 yr, basal area and aboveground biomass returned to pre-hurricane levels, while species richness, diversity indices, and stem densities exceeded pre-hurricane levels. Differences in species composition among geomorphic settings had not returned after 15 yr but differences in stem densities and structure were beginning to emerge. Significant differences were observed in the nutrient concentration of the three species that comprised the most aboveground biomass, and between species categorized as secondary high-light species and primary, low-light species. Species whose abundance was negatively correlated with the mature forest dominant also had distinct nutrient concentrations. When total aboveground nutrient pools were compared over time, differences in leaf nutrients among species were hidden by similarities in wood nutrient concentrations and the biomass dominance of a few species. The observed successional trajectory indicates that changes in species composition contributed to fast recovery of aboveground biomass and nutrient pools, while the influence of geomorphic setting on species composition occurs at time scales > 15 yr of succession.

AB Asplenium nidus is an abundant epiphytic fern of tropical rain forests in the Old World, where it plays an important ecological role in the forest canopy as host to diverse arthropod communities. We investigated the factors that determine the distribution and abundance of A. nidus in the canopy of an aseasonal lowland dipterocarp forest at Pasoh Forest Reserve, Malaysia. We found that A. nidus was more abundant in the understory, and on hosts with smooth bark and relatively flat branch angles. Ferns were found on a wide diversity and size range of host taxa. However, both host taxa and host diameter at breast height had a significant effect on A. nidus occupancy. Asplenium nidus had an aggregated spatial distribution at all scales within the study area. Spatial aggregation at larger scales appears to be driven by habitat preference, as A. nidus abundance was positively associated with swampy areas and negatively associated with hilly areas. At smaller scales, limited dispersal of their wind-dispersed spores most likely explains the aggregated distribution. Larger individuals occurred higher in the canopy and were more common in the hilly area. Thus, the distribution of A. nidus may represent a trade-off between the availability of suitable microsites for establishment in the understory and better growth conditions higher in the canopy. However, A. nidus is known to comprise a complex of cryptic species, and future studies should incorporate molecular techniques to elucidate the potential role of speciation in explaining these patterns.

AB The wet and dry seasons in tropical rain forests can differ in precipitation, soil moisture and irradiance more significantly than often assumed. This could potentially affect the water relations of many tree species that may exhibit either increased transpiration in the dry season as a response to the increased irradiance or decreased transpiration as a result of decreases in soil moisture and increases in atmospheric vapor pressure deficit (VPD). Atmospheric data, soil moisture data and sap fluxes in Iriartea deltoidea palms were measured in eastern Ecuador during the wet and dry seasons. There were no differences between total daily sap fluxes in I. deltoidea palms during the wet and dry seasons; however, evaporative demand was significantly higher in the dry season and therefore, transpiration was more restricted by stomatal closure during the dry season than the wet season. This is likely the result of larger atmospheric VPD during the dry season compared with the wet season and possibly the result of reduced soil moisture availability. Additionally, based on published tree abundances in this area, measured sap fluxes in I. deltoidea were scaled up to the hectare level. Transpiration from I. deltoidea palms was estimated to be around 0.03 mm/d, which could represent about 1 percent of total transpiration in this area of the Amazon rain forest. If climate change predictions for more lengthy tropical dry periods are realized, greater stomatal control of dry-season sap flux has the potential to become even more prevalent in tropical species.

AB This study compares demographic parameters and population dynamics for high disturbance (maquis) and low disturbance (rain forest) environments of the montane conifer, Araucaria laubenfelsii, in New Caledonia. The establishment, growth, survival and reproduction of ca 2500 individuals were followed in permanent plots over 10 yr. Growth and survival rates for A. laubenfelsii show that it is a long-lived, slow growing tree, with evidence of suppression in the sapling size classes in mature rain forest. Growth rates for all size classes are generally faster in maquis than rain forest. Transition matrix analyses estimated positive rates of population increase (lambda values > 1), with populations expanding in maquis, and stable in mature forest. Araucaria laubenfelsii is able to regenerate continuously in maquis and early successional rain forest, but recruitment is limited in older stands. Life table response experiment analyses showed that reproduction, and transitions from sapling to mature tree stage, contributed positively to lambda in maquis, but negatively in forest. Araucaria laubenfelsii on Mont Do can be considered a long-lived pioneer, with early maquis colonizers helping to drive succession from maquis to forest. While opportunities for recruitment decline with time as rain forest sites develop a closed canopy, occasional gap phase recruitment, combined with disturbance by cyclones, landslides and fire, provide opportunities to ensure species persistence. Understanding contrasting population dynamics of A. laubenfelsii in maquis and rain forest will better facilitate conservation management of this species, particularly given current high rates of land conversion and degradation in New Caledonia.

AB Early forest gap regeneration may be generated by postdisturbance seed rain and by seed, seedling or bud banks (i.e., resprouting). The relative importance of each process may depend on several factors (e.g., fruit/seed production, abundance and behavior of seed dispersers, gap characteristics, etc.). We experimentally compared the importance of seed-bank and seed-rain affecting early recruitment of seedlings in an Amazonian forest (Zafire Biological Station, Colombia), using soil transplants from forests to gaps and seed rain enclosures. We found that, during the 8-mo study, the seed-bank contributed with a larger number of individuals and species than seed-rain. The low seedling recruitment rates may be associated with reduced populations of animal seed-dispersers due to hunting and/or low levels of forest fruit production.

AB Dry forests are among the most endangered natural communities in the Hawaiian Islands. Most have been reduced to isolated trees and small forest fragments in which native tree species reproduce poorly. The replacement of native birds by introduced generalists may be contributing to dry forest decline through modification of seed dispersal patterns. To document seed dispersal by introduced birds, we conducted foraging observations on fleshy-fruited trees and measured seed rain under trees and in adjacent open areas for 1 year in a dry forest dominated by native trees. Although trees covered only 15.2 percent of the study area, 96.9 percent of the bird-dispersed seeds were deposited beneath them. The Japanese white-eye (Zosterops japonicus) was the principal dispersal agent. Among bird-dispersed seeds, those of the invasive tree Bocconia frutescens accounted for 75 percent of all seeds collected beneath trees (14.8 seeds/m2/yr) and the invasive shrub Lantana camara accounted for 17 percent. Although nearly 60 percent of the reserve's native woody species possess fleshy fruits, introduced birds rarely disperse their seeds. Native trees accounted for < 8 percent of all bird-dispersed seeds and are consequently experiencing dispersal failure by falling directly under parent trees. Smaller-seeded non-native plants, in contrast, may be benefiting from dispersal by introduced birds. Current dispersal patterns suggest that these readily disseminated non-native plants may eventually replace the remaining native flora.

AB Basic knowledge of the relationships between tree growth and environmental variables is crucial for understanding forest dynamics and predicting vegetation responses to climate variations. Trees growing in tropical areas with a clear seasonality in rainfall often form annual growth rings. In the understory, however, tree growth is supposed to be mainly affected by interference for access to light and other resources. In the semi-deciduous Mayombe forest of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the evergreen species Aidia ochroleuca, Corynanthe paniculata and Xylopia wilwerthii dominate the understory. We studied their wood to determine whether they form annual growth rings in response to changing climate conditions. Distinct growth rings were proved to be annual and triggered by a common external factor for the three species. Species-specific site chronologies were thus constructed from the cross-dated individual growth-ring series. Correlation analysis with climatic variables revealed that annual radial stem growth is positively related to precipitation during the rainy season but at different months. The growth was found to associate with precipitation during the early rainy season for Aidia but at the end of the rainy season for Corynanthe and Xylopia. Our results suggest that a dendrochronological approach allows the understanding of climate-growth relationships in tropical forests, not only for canopy trees but also for evergreen understory species and thus arguably for the whole tree community. Global climate change influences climatic seasonality in tropical forest areas, which is likely to result in differential responses across species with a possible effect on forest composition over time.

AB Migratory behavior in bats is poorly described, particularly in the Neotropics. Stable-hydrogen isotope (delta D) analysis may allow tracking of altitudinal movements of bats but has not been explored. delta D values in rainwater (delta D(p)) deplete linearly with altitude and are reflected in the keratinous tissues of animals through diet. A mismatch between keratin delta D (delta D(k)) and that expected at the capture site based on delta D(p) can indicate prior migration. We collected rainwater, claws and hair from eight bat species at two lower-montane forest sites in Nicaragua. Claw delta D for Carollia brevicauda and hair and claws for Desmodus rotundus (known to be non-migratory) fell within the predicted range based on rainwater (-17 to -60 parts per thousand) suggesting these tissues were synthesized at the study site. delta D tissue values for Artibeus toltecus, Sturnira lilium, Glossophaga soricina, Anoura geoffroyi, and hair for C. brevicauda were more negative than predicted for the capture site (-60 parts per thousand) suggesting tissue synthesis at higher elevation and migration downslope to the capture site. However, our study area represents the highest elevation in the region; the nearest appropriate higher elevations are 350-500 km away and seasonal migration is expected to be < 200 km. Thus we consider that seasonal shifts in delta Dp (9 to -45 parts per thousand) may result in differences in species which molt at different times, and that diet may have driven differences in delta D. Our results suggest that the effects of molt timing and diet may first need to be understood before delta D may be successfully used to track bat movements.

AB Multitrophic interactions play key roles in the origin and maintenance of species diversity, and the study of these interactions has contributed to important theoretical advances in ecology and evolutionary biology. Nevertheless, most biodiversity inventories focus on static species lists, and prominent theories of diversity still ignore trophic interactions. The lack of a simple interaction metric that is analogous to species richness is one reason why diversity of interactions is not examined as a response or predictor variable in diversity studies. Using plant-herbivore-enemy trophic chains as an example, we develop a simple metric of diversity in which richness, diversity indices (e.g., Simpson's 1/D), and rarefaction diversity are calculated with links as the basic unit rather than species. Interactions include all two-link (herbivore-plant and enemy-herbivore) and three-link (enemy-herbivore-plant) chains found in a study unit. This metric is different from other indices, such as traditional diversity measures, connectivity and interaction diversity in food-web studies, and the diversity of interaction index in behavioral studies, and it is easier to compute. Using this approach to studying diversity provides novel insight into debates about neutrality and correlations between diversity, stability, productivity, and ecosystem services.

AB Anthropogenic activities have accelerated the rate of global loss of biodiversity, making it more important than ever to understand the structure of biodiversity hotspots. One current focus is the relationship between species richness and aboveground biomass (AGB) in a variety of ecosystems. Nonetheless, species diversity, evenness, rarity, or dominance represent other critical attributes of biodiversity and may have associations with AGB that are markedly different than that of species richness. Using data from large trees in four environmentally similar sites in the Luquillo Experimental Forest of Puerto Rico, we determined the shape and strength of relationships between each of five measures of biodiversity (i.e., species richness, Simpson's diversity, Simpson's evenness, rarity, and dominance) and AGB. We quantified these measures of biodiversity using either proportional biomass or proportional abundance as weighting factors. Three of the four sites had a unimodal relationship between species richness and AGB, with only the most mature site evincing a positive, linear relationship. The differences between the mature site and the other sites, as well as the differences between our richness-AGB relationships and those found at other forest sites, highlight the crucial role that prior land use and severe storms have on this forest community. Although the shape and strength of relationships differed greatly among measures of biodiversity and among sites, the strongest relationships within each site were always those involving richness or evenness.

AB The rain forest canopy hosts a large percentage of the world's plant biodiversity, which is maintained, in large part, by internal nutrient cycling. This is the first study to examine the effects of site (canopy, forest floor) and tree species (Dipteryx panamensis, Lecythis ampla, Hyeronima alchorneoides) on decay rates of a common substrate and in situ leaf litter in a tropical forest in Costa Rica. Decay rates were slower for both substrates within the canopy than on the forest floor. The slower rate of mass loss of the common substrate in the canopy was due to differences in microclimate between sites. Canopy litter decay rates were negatively correlated with litter lignin:P ratios, while forest floor decay rates were negatively correlated with lignin concentrations, indicating that the control of litter decay rates in the canopy is P availability while that of the forest floor is carbon quality. The slower cycling rates within the canopy are consistent with lower foliar nutrient concentrations of epiphytes compared with forest floor-rooted plants. Litter decay rates, but not common substrate decay rates, varied among tree species. The lack of variation in common substrate decay among tree species eliminated microclimatic variation as a possible cause for differences in litter decay and points to variation in litter quality, nutrient availability and decomposer community of tree species as the causal factors. The host tree contribution to canopy nutrient cycling via litter quality and inputs may influence the quality and quantity of canopy soil resources.

AB We test the hypotheses proposed by Gentry and Schnitzer that liana density and basal area in tropical forests vary negatively with mean annual precipitation (MAP) and positively with seasonality. Previous studies correlating liana abundance with these climatic variables have produced conflicting results, warranting a new analysis of drivers of liana abundance based on a different dataset. We compiled a pan-tropical dataset containing 28,953 lianas (>= 2.5 cm diam.) from studies conducted at 13 Neotropical and 11 Paleotropical dry to wet lowland tropical forests. The ranges in MAP and dry season length (DSL) (number of months with mean rainfall < 100 mm) represented by these datasets were 860-7250 mm/yr and 0-7 mo, respectively. Pan-tropically, liana density and basal area decreased significantly with increasing annual rainfall and increased with increasing DSL, supporting the hypotheses of Gentry and Schnitzer. Our results suggest that much of the variation in liana density and basal area in the tropics can be accounted for by the relatively simple metrics of MAP and DSL.

AB In rain forest, the large numbers of species of fleshy-fruited plants and frugivorous animals result in a large number of potential fruit-frugivore interactions, which are challenging to survey in the field. Yet, knowledge of these relationships is needed to predict consequences of changes in the frugivore assemblage for seed dispersal. In the absence of comprehensive dietary information, it may be possible to delineate between frugivores that disperse different plants using 'functional traits,' or morphological and behavioral attributes of frugivores that interact with differences in salient characteristics of plant species. Here we use data on the consumption of 244 Australian rain forest plant species by 38 bird species to test for associations between patterns of frugivory and birds': (1) degree of frugivory, (2) gape width, and (3) seed treatment (seed crushing or seed dispersing). Degree of frugivory and gape width explain 74 percent of the variation in the sizes of fruits consumed by frugivorous birds. Among birds that consume a substantial dietary proportion of fruit, birds with wider gapes consume larger fruits. In contrast, this relationship was not shown by birds for which fruit is only a minor dietary component. Degree of frugivory and gape width, together with seed treatment, also strongly predict the overall taxonomic composition and diversity of plants consumed by bird species. Functional classifications of frugivore species may prove useful in developing a predictive understanding of fruit-frugivore interactions in other rain forest regions where detailed dietary information is not available for most frugivores.

AB Seed germination is determined by the environmental conditions typical of a habitat and also by the geographical origin of the source species pool. During the Quaternary, Brazilian Atlantic Rain Forest species expanded their distribution into the sandy coastal plains (restingas). Periods of water shortage, however, are frequent in the sandy substrate of the restinga. We investigated whether the germination characteristics of restinga species are more related to their biogeographical origin in the humid forest or to water shortage on sandy substrates. We characterized the seed dispersal phenology of a restinga community and conducted experiments to determine the water requirements for seed germination and the short-term seed dehydration sensitivity of different species. Species shed seeds throughout the year in the restinga. When subjected to Psi=-0.37 MPa, seed germination percentage decreased and germination time increased in six of ten species when compared with Psi=0 MPa. Most species showed high seed moisture content (MC > 40 %) at seed dispersal. Seeds took 3-17 d to dehydrate when subjected to relative humidity < 76 percent and only two of eight species had seeds sensitive to short-term dehydration. Thus, rather than a specific set of germination characteristics related to humid or dry habitats, we gathered evidence to show that the germination characteristics of restinga species represent a multiplicity of responses that may be found in both kinds of habitat.

AB The pollination ecology and breeding system of the Hamamelidaceae tree species Rhodoleia championii were studied in an evergreen broad-leaved forest in Nankunshan National Forest in Guangdong Province in China. Rhodoleia championii produces lipid-rich pollen grains and dilute nectar (averaging 0.7 mL/d and 9% sugar), with nectar production peaking before 0800 h; the species is self-incompatible and does not set seed asexually. Seven species of nectar-foraging birds visited the inflorescences, with the most common visitors being Japanese white-eyes (Zosterops japonicus, Zosteropidae) and fork-tailed sunbirds (Aethopyga christinae, Nectariniidae). Bumblebees and honeybees played limited roles as pollinators. As documented by fossils from Europe, the Rhodoleia stem lineage dates back at least to the Paleocene. Bird pollination, however, is unlikely to have evolved before the Oligocene when sunbirds arrived in Europe, and pollination by Z. japonicus cannot be much older than 250,000 million years ago, when Z. japonicus diverged from its closest relative.

AB Coffee is a globally important crop that is subject to numerous pest problems, many of which are partially controlled by predatory ants. Yet several studies have proposed that these ecosystem services may be reduced where agricultural systems are more intensively managed. Here we investigate the predatory ability of twig-nesting ants on the main pest of coffee, the coffee berry borer (Hypothenemus hampei) under different management systems in southwest Chiapas, Mexico. We conducted both laboratory and field experiments to examine which twig-nesting ant species, if any, can prey on free-living borers or can remove borers embedded in coffee fruits and whether the effects of the twig-nesting ant community differ with habitat type. Results indicate that several species of twig-nesting ants are effective predators of both free-living borers and those embedded in coffee fruits. In the lab, Pseudomyrmex ejectus, Pseudomyrmex simplex, and Pseudomyrmex PSW-53 effectively removed free-living and embedded borers. In the field, abundance, but not diversity, of twig-nesting ant colonies was influenced by shade management techniques, with the highest colony abundance present in the sites where shade trees were recently pruned. However, borer removal rates in the field were significant only in the shadiest site, but not in more intensively managed sites. This study provides evidence that twig-nesting ants can act as predators of the coffee berry borer and that the presence of twig-nesting ants may not be strongly linked to shade management intensity, as has been suggested for other arthropod predators of the borer.

AB A population of the poorly known riparian frog Eleutherodactylus cuneatus was studied for 1 yr along a mountain stream in eastern Cuba. We examined population structure, seasonal and daily activity, growth, and habitat use using mark-recapture and call-point counts. Juveniles were observed during all survey periods with a spike in March. Higher numbers of adults were present in May-July, associated with longer day length, warmer temperatures, and the onset of the rainy season. This was coincident with higher calling activity away from the stream, suggesting an increase in both reproductive and nonreproductive activity in the warmer months between May and September. The number of individuals peaked at 2000-2200 h, but high numbers of individuals were visible throughout the night. Lower activity levels were observed throughout the day. Population size estimates were 84-131 adults and 124-304 juveniles, with averages of 110 and 236 individuals, survival rates were high but capture probabilities were low for a 5-d period in March 2004. Growth rate was negatively related to the size of recaptured individuals, although decreases in growth rate were slight. Frogs were found either in the water (49.7%), or in the banks and on the ground adjacent to the stream where most individuals were found on the ground under the cover of rocks, leaf litter, or large palm fronds. These results provide baseline knowledge of E. cuneatus population dynamics and ecology needed for a rapid detection of any decline this population may undergo in the future.

AB When assessing fragmentation effects on species, not only habitat preferences on the landscape scale, but also microhabitat selection is an important factor to consider, as microhabitat is also affected by habitat disturbance, but nevertheless essential for species for foraging, nesting and sheltering. In the Atlantic Rainforest of Brazil we examined microhabitat selection of six Pyriglena leucoptera (white-shouldered fire-eye), 10 Sclerurus scansor (rufous-breasted leaftosser), and 30 Chiroxiphia caudata (blue manakin). We radio-tracked the individuals between May 2004 and February 2005 to gain home ranges based on individual fixed kernels. Vegetation structures in core plots and fringe plots were compared. In C. caudata, we additionally assessed the influence of behavioural traits on microhabitat selection. Further, we compared microhabitat structures in the fragmented forest with those in the contiguous, and contrasted the results with the birds' preferences. Pyriglena leucoptera preferred liana tangles that were more common in the fragmented forest, whereas S. scansor preferred woody debris, open forest floor (up to 0.5 m), and a thin closed leaf litter cover which all occurred significantly more often in the contiguous forest. Significant differences were detected in C. caudata for vegetation densities in the different strata; the distance of core plots to the nearest lek site was significantly influenced by sex and age. However, core sites of C. caudata in fragmented and contiguous forests showed no significant differences in structure. Exploring microhabitat selection and behavior may greatly support the understanding of habitat selection of species and their susceptibility to fragmentation on the landscape scale.

AB Primate fruit choice among plant species has been attributed to different morphological plant and fruit characteristics. Despite a high abundance of animal-dispersed plant species in the savanna-forest mosaic of West Africa, few data are available on the interplay between morphological fruit traits and primate fruit consumers in this ecosystem. We tested whether olive baboons (Papio anubis) at Comoe National Park, north-eastern Ivory Coast, prefer fruit species with particular characteristics relative to the availability of these traits among the woody plant species at the study site. Specifically we were interested in the suites of traits that best predict fruit choice and seed handling by baboons. The baboons ate fruit/seeds from 74 identified plant species, representing 25 percent of the regional pool of woody plant species. They preferred trees to shrubs and lianas as fruit sources. Otherwise, baboons seemed to consume whatever fruit type, color, and size of fruit and seeds available, though they especially included larger fruit into their diet. Against expectations from the African bird-monkey fruit syndrome of brightly colored drupes and berries, baboons ate mostly species having large, dull-colored fruit. Fruit type and color best described whether baboons included a species into their diet, whereas fruit type and seed size best predicted whether baboons predated upon the seeds of their food plant species. As most plant species at the study site had medium-sized to large fruits and seeds, large frugivores like baboons might be particularly important for plant fitness and plant community dynamics in West African savanna-forest ecosystems.

AB Effective management and conservation of an ecosystem requires information on species assemblages as well as reliable estimates of population sizes to plan, implement and evaluate management strategies. The Brazilian Pantanal is one of the world's largest freshwater wetlands and considered a priority landscape for wildlife conservation. It is subject to pluri-annual extreme dry and wet periods, which cause extreme flood and drought events, which strongly affect wildlife. Using the line-transect method, this study examined the distribution of densities and metabolic biomass of medium- to large-sized nonvolant mammals in forest, cerrado and floodplain landscapes, in an area with low anthropogenic influence, in the central area of the Brazilian Pantanal during a prolonged drought. Comparisons with a previous survey conducted during years of average rainfall in part of the study area suggest that population fluctuations of certain species are closely associated with water due to the drought. Results from this study showed that mammal assemblages varied between landscapes. Forested landscapes have the highest densities of mammals and are the most important in terms of relative energy consumption. In addition, at the time of the study, frugivores were found to have higher energy consumption than browser/grazers across the three landscapes; most fruits are produced in forested areas stressing their importance. By converting forested landscapes into grasslands, the intensification of ranching practices seriously threatens biodiversity and ecological processes in the region.

AB Long-term conservation in biodiversity hotspots depends on the recovery of communities in secondary forest fragments. In most cases, however, recovery strategies for these areas are based only on passive restoration. It is therefore necessary to determine the efficiency of such strategies. In this study, we assess the efficiency of passive restoration on a 567-ha 28-yr-old fragment of Atlantic Rainforest in Northeastern Brazil. We measured richness, composition, abundance and biomass of a lizard taxocene and also vegetation structure and availability of several microhabitat descriptors in 18 plots of this secondary forest. We then compared them with measures in 29 plots from two neighboring reference sites. Species richness, abundance, biomass and microhabitat descriptors availability inside the secondary fragment did not differ from reference sites. However, composition and vegetation structure showed small differences. Some forest specialist lizards, which should be a focus of conservation efforts in fragmented landscapes of the Atlantic Rainforest, were not found in the fragment and data indicate that this was not due to sampling or a lack of suitable habitat or microhabitat. In the presence of preserved source sites, passive restoration may be a cheap and effective way to recover lizard taxocenes of the Atlantic Rainforest. Some of the species may need to be re-introduced to accelerate the full recovery of original composition of lizard taxocenes in secondary Atlantic Rainforests.

AB We investigated the effects of forest fragmentation on golden-headed lion tamarins (Leontopithecus chrysomelas) by qualitatively and quantitatively characterizing the landscape throughout the species range, conducting surveys, and exploring predictive models of presence and absence. We identified 784 forest patches that varied in size, shape, core area, habitat composition, elevation, and distance to neighboring patches and towns. We conducted 284 interviews with local residents and 133 playback experiments in 98 patches. Results indicated a reduction in the western portions of the former species range. We tested whether L. chrysomelas presence or absence was related to the aforementioned fragmentation indices using Monte Carlo logistic regression techniques. The analysis yielded a majority of iterations with a one-term final model of which Core Area Index (percent of total area that is core) was the only significant type. Model concordance ranged between 65 and 90 percent. Area was highlighted for its potential predictive ability. Although final models for area lacked significance, their failure to reach significance was marginal and we discuss potential confounding factors weakening the term's predictive ability. We conclude that lower Core Area Index scores are useful indicators of forest patches at risk for not supporting L. chrysomelas. Taken together, our analyses of the landscape, survey results, and logistic regression modeling indicated that the L. chrysomelas metapopulation is facing substantial threat. The limited vagility of lion tamarins in nonforest matrix may lead to increasingly smaller and inbred populations subject to significant impact from edge effects and small population size. Local extinction is imminent in many forest patches in the L. chrysomelas range.

AB We studied the spatial heterogeneity of tree diversity, and of forest structure and productivity in a highly diverse tropical mountain area in southern Ecuador with the aim of understanding the causes of the large variation in these parameters. Two major environmental gradients, elevation and topography, representing a broad range of climatic and edaphic site conditions, were analyzed. We found the highest species richness of trees in valleys <2100 m. Valleys showed highest values of basal area, leaf area index and tree basal area increment as well. Tree diversity also increased from ridges to valleys, while canopy openness decreased. Significant relationships existed between tree diversity and soil parameters (pH, total contents of Mg, K, Ca, N and P), and between diversity and the spatial variability of pH and Ca and Mg contents suggesting a dependence of tree diversity on both absolute levels and on the small-scale heterogeneity of soil nutrient availability. Tree diversity and basal area increment were positively correlated, partly because both are similarly affected by soil conditions. We conclude that the extraordinarily high tree species richness in the area is primarily caused by three factors: (1) the existence of steep altitudinal and topographic gradients in a rather limited area creating a small-scale mosaic of edaphically different habitats; (2) the intermingling of Amazonian lowland plant species, that reach their upper distribution limits, and of montane forest species; and (3) the geographical position of the study area between the humid eastern Andean slope and the dry interandean forests of South Ecuador.

AB Land-use history and large-scale disturbances interact to shape secondary forest structure and composition. How introduced species respond to disturbances such as hurricanes in post-agriculture forest recovery is of particular interest. To examine the effects of hurricane disturbance and previous land use on forest dynamics and composition, we revisited 37 secondary forest stands in former cattle pastures across Puerto Rico representing a range of exposure to the winds of Hurricane Georges in 1998. Stands ranged from 21 to >80 yr since agricultural abandonment and were measured 9 yr posthurricane. Stem density decreased as stands aged, while basal area and species richness tended to increase. Hurricane disturbance exerted contrasting effects on stand structure, contingent on stand age. In older stands, the basal area of large trees fell, shifting to a stand structure characteristic of younger stands, while the basal area of large trees tended to rise in younger stands with increasing hurricane disturbance. These results demonstrate that large-scale natural disturbances can alter the successional trajectory of secondary forest stands recovering from human land use, but stand age, precipitation and soil series were better predictors of changes in stand structure across all study sites. Species composition changed substantially between census intervals, but neither age nor hurricane disturbance consistently predicted species composition change. However, exposure to hurricane winds tended to decrease the abundance of the introduced tree Spathodea campanulata, particularly in smaller size classes. In all sites the abundance of the introduced tree Syzygium jambos showed a declining trend, again most strongly in smaller size classes, suggesting natural thinning through succession.

AB In this study, we examined the impacts of Attalea oleifera on the structure of seedling bank and discuss potential mechanisms of palm influence. Seed rain, seedling bank, and palm leaf fall were assessed beneath the canopy and in the vicinity of 16 adult palms across the edges of a large fragment (3500 ha) of the Atlantic forest. Moreover, we examined A. oleifera impacts on seed germination and seedling mortality by experimentally submitting seeds and seedlings to prolonged palm-leaf covering. As expected, seedling bank beneath the adults exhibited reduced abundance and species richness at local and habitat scale. Small to large seeds (3.1-30 mm) were underrepresented in the seed rain below adults palms, while experimental leaf covering drastically reduced both seed germination and seedling survivorship. A. oleifera leaf fall occurred over the whole year (3.6 +/- 2.7 leaves/individual/yr), which resulted in deep leaf litter mounds (10.7 +/- 9.2 cm). Finally, adult palm density (21.6 +/- 11.9 individuals/ha) correlated negatively with seedling density across Attalea clusters. Our results suggest that A. oleifera exerts negative effects on the seedling bank by reducing seedling abundance and richness as a consequence of two complementary mechanisms: impoverished and size-biased seed rain plus reduced seed germination and increased seedling mortality due to prolonged covering by fallen leaves.

AB The goal of this study was to ascertain why the production of variable seediness is advantageous for Attalea phalerata palms. Our hypothesis was that variation reduces seed predation by the spiny rats Thrichomys pachyurus and Clyomys laticeps. Although there is a positive correlation between endocarp size and number of seeds, endocarps sometimes contain more or fewer seeds than expected; palms bluff about the number of seed per endocarp. Therefore, rats do not know how many seeds an endocarp contains. To model rats' predating behavior, we applied Charnov's Marginal Value Theorem. The model shows that rats attack endocarps only when the energy gain is higher than the energy available in the habitat. Hence, it is not advantageous to eat all the seeds inside an endocarp. This explains why 45 percent of forest endocarps and 35 percent of savanna endocarps were still viable after predation. We then applied the model to two simulated endocarp populations with less variability in the number of seeds per endocarp size and determined that viable diaspores after predation were reduced to 15 percent. With less variability, palms cannot bluff about the number of seeds inside endocarps and predators can predict accurately how many seeds they should try to eat. Uncertainty about the number of seeds diminished predation but gave selective advantage to multiseeded fruits. Therefore, the bluffing strategy would be evolutionarily stable only if it were counterbalanced by other forces. Otherwise, predators would win the bluffing game.

TI Seedling Mortality and Herbivory Damage in Subtropical and Temperate

AB Herbivory rates are generally thought to be higher in tropical than in temperate forests. Nevertheless, tests of this biogeographic prediction by comparing a single plant species across a tropical-temperate range are scarce. Here, we compare herbivore damage between subtropical and temperate populations of the evergreen tree Aextoxicon punctatum (Olivillo), distributed between 30 degrees and 43 degrees S along the Pacific margin of Chile. To assess the impact of herbivory on Olivillo seedlings, we set up 29 experimental plots, 1.5 x 3 m: 16 in forests of Fray Jorge National Park (subtropical latitude), and 13 in Guabun, Chiloe Island (temperate latitude). Half of each plot was fenced around with chicken wire, to exclude small mammals, and the other half was left unfenced. In each half of the plots we planted 16 seedlings of Olivillo in December 2003, with a total of 928 plants. Seedling survival, leaf production and herbivory by invertebrates were monitored over the next 16 mo. Small mammal herbivores killed ca 30 percent of seedlings in both sites. Nevertheless, invertebrate herbivory was greater in the temperate forest, thus contradicting the expected trend of increasing herbivore impact toward the tropics. Seedling growth was greater in subtropical forest suggesting better conditions for tree growth or that higher invertebrate herbivory depressed seedling growth in the temperate forest. Invertebrate herbivory increased toward temperate latitudes while small mammal herbivory was similar in both sites. We suggest that comparison of single species can be useful to test generalizations about latitudinal patterns and allow disentangling factors controlling herbivory patterns across communities.

AB Spatial variation in the strength of herbivore top-down control represents an important source of variation in plant fitness measures and community structure and function. By measuring seed predator (larvae of a Noctuid moth) and parasitoid impacts on Ruellia nudiflora across a broad spatial scale in Yucatan (Mexico), this study addressed the following: (1) to what extent does seed predator and parasitoid attack intensity associated with R. nudiflora vary spatially? (2) Does parasitoid attack result in a positive indirect effect on the plant, and does the intensity of this effect vary spatially? During the peak of fruit production (late June-early July) of 2005, we collected fruits from 21 R. nudiflora populations and grouped them into four regions: center, east, north and south. For each fruit we recorded: observed seed number, number of seeds eaten, seed predator presence, parasitoid presence and number of seeds '`saved' by parasitoids. Seed predators attacked ca 30 percent of fruits/plant on average, while parasitoids were found in 24 percent of seed predator-attacked fruits. Results indicated spatial variation in seed predator and parasitoid attack levels; interestingly, a contrasting spatial gradient of attack intensity was observed: populations/regions with greatest parasitoid attack levels usually had the lowest seed predator attack levels and vice versa, suggesting top-down control of parasitoids on seed predators. We observed a weak overall indirect impact of parasitoids on R. nudiflora (4% seeds 'saved' on average), which nonetheless varied strongly across populations (e.g., close to 14% seeds saved at one population). Findings indicate a geographical structuring of interaction strengths across populations, as well as spatial variation in the strength of parasitoid cascading effects on plant reproduction.

AB The response of native herbivores to the introduction of a new plant to the community has important implications for plant invasion. Under the Enemy Release Hypothesis introduced species become invasive because of reduced enemy control in the new range, while under the New Association Hypothesis introduced species lack effective defenses against native enemies because they do not share an evolutionary history. I tested the response of a native South-American specialist herbivore Utetheisa ornatrix (Lepidoptera: Arctiidae) to a native (Crotalaria incana) and an introduced host (Crotalaria pallida) (Fabaceae: Papilionoideae). I compared seed predation rates between the two hosts in the field, and I tested preference and performance traits with common garden experiments. Utetheisa ornatrix caused much higher seed predation rates on the introduced host than on the native host. Females also preferred to oviposit on the introduced over the native host. Additionally, larvae feeding on the introduced host had higher fitness (higher pupal weight) than larvae feeding on the native host. I discuss how the response of this specialist herbivore to this introduced host plant contradicts the predictions of the Enemy Release Hypothesis and support the New Association Hypothesis. This study shows that the New Association Hypothesis can also be true for specialist herbivores.

AB Tropical forest floor characteristics such as depth and nutrient concentrations are highly heterogeneous even over small spatial scales and it is unclear how these differences contribute to patchiness in forest floor arthropod abundance and diversity. In a lowland tropical forest in Panama we experimentally increased litter standing crop by removing litter from five plots (L-) and adding it to five other plots (L+); we had five control plots. After 32 mo of treatments we investigated how arthropod abundance and diversity were related to differences in forest floor physical (mass, depth, water content) and chemical properties (pH, nutrient concentrations). Forest floor mass and total arthropod abundance were greater in L+ plots compared with controls. There were no treatment differences in nutrient concentrations, pH or water content of the organic horizons. Over all plots, the mass of the fermentation horizon (Oe) was greater than the litter horizon (Oi); arthropod diversity and biomass were also greater in the Oe horizon but nutrient concentrations tended to be higher in the Oi horizon. Arthropod abundance was best explained by forest floor mass, while arthropod diversity was best explained by phosphorus, calcium and sodium concentrations in the Oi horizon and by phosphorus concentrations in the Oe horizon. Differences in arthropod community composition between treatments and horizons correlated with phosphorus concentration and dry mass of the forest floor. We conclude that at a local scale, arthropod abundance is related to forest floor mass ( habitat space), while arthropod diversity is related to forest floor nutrient concentrations (habitat quality).

AB The moth Rothschildia lebeau uses three tree species as its primary larval hosts in the tropical dry forest of northwestern Costa Rica. These hosts were shown previously to have different relative effects on caterpillar performance, resulting in an apparent host-related life history trade-off between large adult body size on the one hand but low offspring survival on the other. To further assess the potential ecological and evolutionary importance of this trade-off, an observational field study of the relationship between male body size and mating success was conducted. Across mating trials, larger males had a higher probability of being observed mating. Independent of the effect of size, the amount of wing damage an individual had sustained (a measure of relative age) was negatively correlated with the probability a male was observed mating. Within mating trials, the mated male tended to be larger than the average unmated male, but there was no difference in wing damage. Overall, results of this study were consistent with a positive effect of male body size on mating success, consistent with the idea that larval host plant history and its effects on adult body size matters in terms of adult male fitness. However, all sized males were observed mating over the course of the study, and the size advantage did not appear to be particularly strong.

AB Giant tortoises were once a megafaunal element widespread in tropical and subtropical ecosystems. The role of giant tortoises as herbivores and seed dispersers, however, is poorly known. We evaluated tortoise impacts on Opuntia cactus (Cactaceae) in the Galapagos Islands, one of the last areas where giant tortoises remain extant, where the cactus is a keystone resource for many animals. We contrasted cactus populations immediately inside and outside natural habitats where tortoises had been held captive for several decades. Through browsing primarily and trampling secondarily tortoises strongly reduced densities of small (0.5-1.5 m high) cacti, especially near adult cacti, and thereby reduced densities of cacti in larger size classes. Tortoises also caused a shift from vegetative to sexual modes of reproduction in cacti. We conclude that giant tortoises promote a sparse and scattered distribution in Opuntia cactus and its associated biota in the Galapagos Islands.

AB The lowland tapir Tapirus terrestris is the largest herbivore in the Neotropics and feeds on a large quantity of fruits, often ingesting the seeds and defecating them intact. Seed dispersal by the lowland tapir in the southwestern Amazon was studied by examining seeds from 135 dung samples collected between 2005 and 2007. Seeds of a total of 122 plant species were identified, representing 68 genera and 33 families. The species accumulation curve showed that more species can be expected with further sampling. Many species (45%) were only encountered once, and only 10 percent of all species were found in 410 samples, indicating that the lowland tapir is an opportunistic forager. Seed diversity showed a clear seasonal pattern and was highly correlated with fruit availability. Seed diameter ranged from <1 to 25 mm with 81 percent <10 mm diam. The size distribution of seeds found in lowland tapir dung generally followed that of seeds found in the forest, but had a lower proportion of seeds in the smallest size class (<2.5 mm) and a larger proportion found in the largest size class (20-25 mm). The diversity of seeds encountered in dung of the lowland tapir in this study was much higher than in previous studies. We conclude that the lowland tapir is a potential disperser for a large number of plant species, including many that previously have been thought to be dispersed only by large primates.

AB Spatial patterns of seed dispersal are the focus of numerous theoretical examinations of endozoochory. Here, we examine the spatial pattern of seed dispersal by white-faced capuchin monkeys Cebus capucinus in Santa Rosa National Park, Costa Rica, and the neighborhood characteristics and distance variables most closely associated with seed survival and germination, and seedling survival and growth in various locations. Overall, distance to the nearest fruiting conspecific tree has the most positive, consistent effect on growth and survival variables, which supports a variation of the Janzen-Connell seed escape hypothesis.

AB Most tropical trees produce fleshy fruits that attract frugivores that disperse their seeds. Early demography and distribution for these tree species depend on the effects of frugivores and their behavior. Anthropogenic changes that affect frugivore communities could ultimately result in changes in tree distribution and population demography. We studied the frugivore assemblage at 38 fruiting Elmerrillia tsiampaca, a rain forest canopy tree species in Papua New Guinea. Elmerrillia tsiampaca is an important resource for frugivorous birds at our study site because it produces abundant lipid-rich fruits at a time of low fruit availability. We classified avian frugivores into functional disperser groups and quantified visitation rates and behavior at trees during 56 canopy and 35 ground observation periods. We tested predictions derived from other studies of plant-frugivore interactions with this little-studied frugivore assemblage in an undisturbed rain forest. Elmerrillia tsiampaca fruits were consumed by 26 bird species, but most seeds were removed by eight species. The most important visitors (Columbidae, Paradisaeidae and Rhyticeros plicatus) were of a larger size than predicted based on diaspore size. Columbidae efficiently exploited the structurally protected fruit, which was inconsistent with other studies in New Guinea where structurally protected fruits were predominantly consumed by Paradisaeidae. Birds vulnerable to predation foraged for short time periods, consistent with the hypothesis that predator avoidance enhances seed dispersal. We identified seven functional disperser groups, indicating there is little redundancy in disperser groups among the regular and frequent visitors to this tropical rain forest tree species.

AB This study examined the importance of habitat heterogeneity on the avian community composition, and investigated the scale at which species abundances respond to habitat variables. The study was conducted within a diverse landscape matrix of a shaded coffee region in Mexico. To detect at which characteristic spatial scale different species and foraging guilds respond most strongly we analyzed the effect of plot-, patch- and landscape-level variables at different spatial extent (i.e., different kilometer radii) on species composition and foraging guilds. We used redundancy analysis to identify species-environment correlations, and to identify predictor variables that best explained the bird community structure, quantified the influence of plot-, patch- and landscape-level variables on the bird community composition. In addition, we used the 4th-corner method to detect significant relationships between the dietary guilds and plot-, patch- and landscape-level variables. We recorded 12,335 individuals of 181 bird species; 105 bird species were recorded foraging within the shaded coffee plantations. We found that plot- and landscape-level variables significantly explained the bird community composition best across all scales, and were significantly correlated with the abundance of the dietary guilds. In contrast, patch- level variables were less important. Habitat composition variables (i.e., coffee, forest and agricultural area) were among the most important predictors. Canopy structure was more important than other vegetation structure variables in explaining dietary guild structure. Hence, the maintenance of a heterogeneous landscape with a high-quality matrix within an agro-ecological region enhances bird conservation.

AB To test flying fox adaptations to a habitat mosaic with extreme deforestation, the abundance, habitat choice and feeding behavior of the Pacific flying fox, Pteropus tonganus, were investigated across 16 islands of the Yasawa archipelago, Fiji. The habitat mosaic is formed by 4.3 percent tropical dry forest and 3.3 percent farmland, leaving exotic grasslands and stands of Leucaena leucocephala to overrun the vast majority of land. Pteropus tonganus abundance was high (5757 bats) despite deforestation and hunting. Roosting sites were restricted to native forest fragments. Grasslands and stands of L. leucocephala were completely void of bats at all times. The mean foraging density in farmland was four times higher than in forests and foraging competition was routinely observed in farmland but was extremely rare in forests. The author suggests that during the study, extensive foraging in farmland was supporting the high P. tonganus population. Additionally, the preferential foraging in farmland was responsible for the low foraging densities within forests and dramatically less intraspecies competition for forest resources. Further research is needed on seed dispersal within forests and to test for seasonal variations in bat abundance and feeding.

AB Manu National Park of southern Peru is one of the most renowned protected areas in the world, yet large-bodied vertebrate surveys conducted to date have been restricted to Cocha Cashu Biological Station, a research station covering <0.06 percent of the 1.7Mha park. Manu Park is occupied by >460 settled Matsigenka Amerindians, 300-400 isolated Matsigenka, and several, little-known groups of isolated hunter-gatherers, yet the impact of these native Amazonians on game vertebrate populations within the park remains poorly understood. On the basis of 1495 km of standardized line-transect censuses, we present density and biomass estimates for 23 mammal, bird, and reptile species for seven lowland and upland forest sites in Manu Park, including Cocha Cashu. We compare these estimates between hunted and nonhunted sites within Manu Park, and with other Neotropical forest sites. Manu Park safeguards some of the most species-rich and highest biomass assemblages of arboreal and terrestrial mammals ever recorded in Neotropical forests, most likely because of its direct Andean influence and high levels of soil fertility. Relative to Barro Colorado Island, seed predators and arboreal folivores in Manu are rare, and generalist frugivores specializing on mature fruit pulp are abundant. The impact of such a qualitative shift in the vertebrate community on the dynamics of plant regeneration, and therefore, on our understanding of tropical plant ecology, must be profound. Despite a number of external threats, Manu Park continues to serve as a baseline against which other Neotropical forests can be gauged.

AB The vegetation near El Bosque Petrificado Piedra Chamana, in the northern Peruvian Andes, is evergreen sclerophyllous forest with significant shrub, epiphyte, and mat components. Important/characteristic genera include Dodonaea, Polylepis, Oreopanax, Oreocallis, Myrcianthes, and the mat-forming orchid Pleurothallis. A vegetation survey including 12 transects and 240 plots in high- and low-grazed areas documented 96 plant species. Compared with low-grazed areas, high- grazed areas had significantly fewer tree species, more herbs, and higher density of individuals. Both grazing categories exhibited high connectedness (as seen in network metrics) and positive biotic associations (nestedness), suggesting facilitation of some species by others, but high- grazed areas showed greater indications of positive associations (as seen in the C-score and V-ratio). These positive biotic associations may relate to the harsh environment and the role of keystone taxa such as Dodonaea viscosa, canopy trees, and mat-forming elements in moderating conditions and promoting species establishment. Only in the low-grazed areas was there any indication of competitive interactions (negative C-score/less than expected species-pair occurrence). The shift in sign of the C-score, from negative in low-grazed areas to positive in high- grazed areas, indicates a loss of competitive interactions as a factor influencing community structure where grazing pressure is higher. Conservation of the area's natural resources would be advanced by protection of areas where the vegetation structure is more intact, better controls on grazing animals, and identification of development alternatives that would reduce pressure on the area's unique vegetation.

ID SCIENCE
AB Estimates of the percent of Earth's land surface that has either been transformed or degraded by human activity range between 39 and 50 percent, with agriculture accounting for the vast majority of these changes. Although much of the focus of research on land use and cover change in the tropics has been on deforestation, ongoing socioeconomic changes both locally and globally have made land transitions in the tropics extremely fluid. In addition, feedbacks between land cover change and human behavior constrain the extent and trajectories of land transitions. The sustainability of land use systems in the tropics depends on an understanding of coupled human-natural systems that can lead to general frameworks for management and prediction. The unprecedented availability of land use/cover data together with ecological data collected at large spatial scales offer exciting opportunities for advancing our understanding of socioecological systems. We rely on six studies of land transitions in the tropics to illustrate some promising approaches and pose critical questions to guide this body of research.

TI Forest Rehabilitation and Its Implication for Forest Transition Theory

AB Forest transition theory bases its predictions of forest recovery in temperate regions primarily on macro-economic factors. In tropical countries, it is important to understand additional complex processes underlying forest recovery. Forest rehabilitation-meaning efforts to restore tree cover-is an important contributor to forest recovery in many tropical regions. Forest rehabilitation itself is subject to multiple factors that influence its scale, effectiveness and outcomes. This paper reviews forest rehabilitation in six countries-Brazil, China, Indonesia, Peru, Philippines and Vietnam. The cases reviewed suggest that globally, forest rehabilitation efforts can be understood in four time periods, or eras, each with distinct approaches to forest rehabilitation and outcomes. Various factors that influence forest rehabilitation outcomes evolved during these eras. Current outcomes of forest rehabilitation can only be adequately predicted if the historical processes influencing forest rehabilitation are understood. The paper suggests that forest transition in the tropics needs to be analyzed not only in terms of macro-economic factors, but also in terms of the factors that influence forest rehabilitation outcomes as well as other processes that affect forest cover increase.

AB While research continues on the causes, consequences, and rates of deforestation and forest degradation in the tropics, there is little agreement about what exactly is being lost, what we want back, and to whom the 'we' refers. Particularly unsettling is that many analyses and well-intended actions are implemented in fogs of ambiguity surrounding definitions of the term 'forest'-a problem that is not solely semantic; with development of markets for biomass carbon, vegetation classification exercises take on new relevance. For example, according to the basic implementation guidelines of the Kyoto Protocol, closed canopy natural forest could be replaced by monoclonal plantations of genetically engineered exotic tree species and no deforestation would have occurred. Following these same guidelines, carbon credits for afforestation could be available for planting trees in species-rich savannas; these new plantations would count towards a country moving towards the 'forest transition,' the point at which there is no net 'forest' loss. Such obvious conflicts between biodiversity conservation and carbon sequestration might be avoided if 'forest' was clearly defined and if other vegetation types and other ecosystem values were explicitly recognized. While acknowledging that no one approach to vegetation classification is likely to satisfy all users at all scales, we present an approach that recognizes the importance of species composition, reflects the utility of land-cover characteristics that are identifiable via remote sensing, and acknowledges that many sorts of forest degradation do not reduce carbon stocks (e. g., defaunation) or canopy cover (e. g., over-harvesting of understory nontimber forest products).

AB Shifting cultivators depend on forest biomass inputs to nourish their crops. For them, forest resilience has an immediate impact: it affects crop productivity. A decline in the rate of recovery following shifting cultivation would ultimately affect local, regional and global carbon budgets, with feedbacks to climate. Yet the long-term impacts of shifting cultivation have been quantified in only six locations. In this study, we reanalyze data from these locations to determine whether the rate of biomass recovery is the same from cycle to cycle. Further, using case studies in Southern Yucatan, Mexico and West Kalimantan, Indonesia, we investigate the ecological and socioeconomic factors that affect forest resilience and thus determine whether or not shifting cultivation is sustainable. The reanalysis links aboveground biomass recovery following shifting cultivation to site productivity, forest age, fallow length, history of cultivation, and soil texture. Across locations, biomass accumulation rate declines by 9.3 percent with each cycle of shifting cultivation. Per cycle change in biomass accumulation rate is significantly more negative in younger forests and forests that experience a shorter fallow period. However, more detailed analyses for two case studies suggest that a purely ecological framework is of limited effectiveness in explaining variability in the effect of repeated shifting cultivation. Rather, socioeconomic factors such as migration, subsidies, roads, and settlement history can alter the outcome of shifting cultivation by limiting the accumulation and use of local knowledge.

Mature forests had significantly higher relative abundance of understory trees and slow-growing canopy/emergent trees, but lower relative abundance of fast-growing canopy/emergent trees than secondary forests. Fast-growing subcanopy and canopy trees reached peak densities early in succession. Density of fast-growing canopy/emergent trees increased during the first 20 yr of succession, whereas basal area continued to increase beyond 40 yr. We also assigned canopy tree species to one of three colonization groups, based on the presence of seedlings, saplings, and trees in four secondary forest plots. Among 93 species evaluated, 68 percent were classified as regenerating pioneers (both trees and regeneration present), whereas only 6 percent were classified as nonregenerating pioneers (trees only) and 26 percent as forest colonizers (regeneration only). Slow-growing trees composed 72 percent of the seedling and sapling regeneration for forest colonizers, whereas fast-growing trees composed 63 percent of the seedlings and saplings of regenerating pioneers. Tree stature and growth rates capture much of the functional variation that appears to drive successional dynamics. Results further suggest strong linkages between functional types defined based on adult height and growth rates of large trees and abundance of seedling and sapling regeneration during secondary succession.

AB In land change science studies, a cover type is defined by land surface attributes, specifically including the types of vegetation, topography and human structures, which makes it difficult to characterize land cover as discrete classes. One of the challenges in characterizing a land-cover type is to distinguish variability within the class from actual land-cover transformation. The spread of plant invasions in tropical systems is affected by seasonal variations and disturbances such as agricultural activities and fires, making it difficult to determine the spread through thematic classifications. In this paper, we estimate the changes in spatial extent and seasonal variation of bracken fern invasion in Southern Yucatan from 1989 to 2005 by using a linear mixture model (LMM), a widely used method in the classification of remotely sensed data. The results show an increase in areas affected by bracken from 40 km(2) in 1989 to almost 80 km(2) in 2000. Lower estimates of the invasion resulted from data acquired at the end of the dry season (March-May), when bracken mixes with secondary vegetation or is removed by fires. The accuracy of the maps is estimated through the use of sketch maps of farmer's parcels and field data collected from 2000 to 2001. Understanding the spatial distribution and annual variability of bracken fern cover in the region is critical to determining the relation between disturbances such as fire and forest recovery. Using LMM may enhance this understanding by giving a more accurate picture of the extent and distribution of bracken fern invasion.

AB Degraded grasslands resulting from intensive land use appear to be highly resistant to tree invasion due to interactions between land use, climate, grazing and fire. We describe long-term patterns of tropical montane forest regeneration into degraded grasslands and analyze their relationships with historical changes in rainfall, grazing and fire in Los Toldos valley (Northwest Argentina), cloud forest life zone (1600 m asl). We used dendrochronological techniques to reconstruct spatial and temporal patterns of Podocarpus parlatorei establishment (the dominant tree species in secondary forests) and grassland fires for the last 150 yr. We assessed current livestock spatial distribution along the valley through feces sampling. Inferred tree establishment patterns (i.e., considering age structure and mortality) were analyzed in relation to temporal and spatial patterns of grazing and fire derived from our own analyses and from government statistics, and to rainfall patterns derived from previous dendrochronological reconstructions. Current grazing intensity was higher close to the local township. Fire occurrence increased with periods of above-average rainfall (higher fuel productivity), and tended to increase with distance to township (less grazing). Tree establishment in grasslands was spatially associated with high grazing intensity and low fire frequency, and temporally associated with periods of high grazing intensity and below-average rainfall. Despite climatic and land-use changes leading to conditions potentially favorable for trees (i.e., more rainfall, less grazing), grasslands persist in this study area, likely due to the direct (saplings burning) and indirect (soil degradation and desiccation) effects of recurrent fires, enhanced by decreasing grazing and increasing rainfall.

AB Land cover transformations in the tropics are not limited to deforestation; they include other complex transitions such as agricultural and urban expansion, pasture development, and secondary vegetation regrowth. Understanding the causes and extent of these highly variable and complex transitions requires close collaboration between biological, physical, and social scientists. Here we address three critical issues in the study of land transitions: (1) What methodological and socioecological criteria should be used for characterizing land cover categories and transformations? Results from case studies presented here call for the creation of continuous land cover classes that allow for detection of disturbance and human use dynamics and consideration of socioeconomic and biophysical criteria in characterizing and monitoring land transitions. (2) What are the most promising theoretical frameworks? Successful theoretical frameworks must bridge disciplinary boundaries, and encompass multiple spatial, temporal, and political scales. (3) Are regime shifts, constraints, and resilience of land transformations in the tropics predictable? Resilience of land use systems requires a feedback loop between ecological constraints and management decisions. This loop may be broken by policies, migration, and flow of capital from global commodity markets. In addition, land transformations may lead to novel interactions between land-use and natural disturbance leading to unpredictable regime shifts in ecosystems. Planning for sustainable patterns of land use requires some understanding of these regime transformations.

AB Oil and gas concessions now cover vast swaths of the western Amazon, including protected areas and indigenous territories. The Yasuni-ITT Initiative, Ecuador's innovative proposal to leave nearly a billion barrels of oil locked beneath Yasuni National Park, is the first major effort to reverse this trend. We provide a concise overview of the initiative, including an in-depth look at its widely lauded goals of protecting biodiversity, respecting indigenous peoples' territory, and combating climate change. We also discuss the proposal's lingering caveats, such as technical questions regarding the generation of financial resources to replace the forgone oil revenue. We conclude that the Yasuni-ITT Initiative is a potentially precedent-setting advance towards avoiding damaging oil and gas development in sensitive areas.

AB This study investigates whether it is possible to simplify the complex influence of numerous species on leaf litter decomposition in a diverse tropical forest using functional classifications to predict litter quality, decomposition rate, and nutrient dynamics during decomposition, over a 2-yr period. Thirty-three lowland tropical forest plant species from contrasting growth forms (canopy trees, pioneer trees, lianas, palms, herbs) were studied. Twelve of 18 indices of litter quality varied significantly among growth forms, with canopy trees and palms showing lower litter quality than pioneer trees and herbs. Canopy leaves decomposed more slowly than understory leaves. Decomposition rate and mass loss trended greater (P < 0.1) in herbs and pioneer trees compared with other growth forms. There were no significant differences between monocots and dicots, and no phylogenetic signal for decomposition was observed. Significant correlations between continuous litter quality variables and decomposition rate were observed with correlation coefficients up to 0.72. Litter lignin: Mg, P concentration, and lignin: K, were the litter quality variables most related to decomposition rate. All elements showed significant negative correlations between initial litter concentration and percent remaining, but many elements showed significant correlation between percent element remaining and initial concentrations of other elements, indicating a stoichiometric balance between these elements during decomposition. The results show that although classification by growth form and canopy position are helpful for considering the ecosystem implications of changing community composition, litter quality traits provide additional predictive power for estimating the effects of species change on decomposition.

AB Drought stress in tropical dry forests is thought to result in greater asexual regeneration via vegetative sprouting (e.g., basal, root, and branch layering) than occurs in moister tropical forests. We tested this hypothesis by examining the prevalence of tree sprouting and seeding in tropical forests located along a rainfall gradient on the island of Hawai'i. Additionally, we examined the potential for novel disturbance, feral pig Sus scrofa rooting and trampling, to alter patterns in tree regeneration mode. We found greater sprouting (in terms of relative density and basal area) in dry forests than in mesic and wet forests, supporting the hypothesis. We also found that feral pig disturbance is negatively correlated with the relative density and basal area of seedlings in wet forests, but is positively correlated with the relative importance of sprouting, and the richness and diversity of sprouting species. Our results suggest rainfall regimes may be an important factor controlling broad-scale patterns in tree regeneration mode, and that exotic ungulates can significantly modify such patterns with potential consequences for the structure and dynamics of tree populations and communities.

AB One of the most significant challenges in developing a predictive understanding of the long-term effects of hurricanes on tropical forests is the development of quantitative models of the relationships between variation in storm intensity and the resulting severity of tree damage and mortality. There have been many comparative studies of interspecific variation in resistance of trees to wind damage based on aggregate responses to individual storms. We use a new approach, based on ordinal logistic regression, to fit quantitative models of the susceptibility of a tree species to different levels of damage across an explicit range of hurricane intensity. Our approach simultaneously estimates both the local intensity of the storm within a plot and the susceptibility to storm damage of different tree species within plots. Using the spatial variation of storm intensity embedded in two hurricanes (Hugo in 1989 and Georges in 1998) that struck the 16 ha Luquillo Forest Dynamics Plot in eastern Puerto Rico, we show that variation in susceptibility to storm damage is an important aspect of life history differentiation. Pioneers such as Cecropia schreberiana are highly susceptible to stem damage, while the late successional species Dacryodes excelsa suffered very little stem damage but significant crown damage. There was a surprisingly weak relationship between tree diameter and the susceptibility to damage for most of the 12 species examined. This may be due to the effects of repeated storms and trade winds on the architecture of trees and forest stands in this Puerto Rican subtropical wet forest.

AB We monitored seventy-two 1 ha permanent plots spread over 64 km 2 of terra firme forest at Reserva Ducke (Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil) over 2-yr intervals to assess the effects of a soil and topographic gradient on the rate of change in the aboveground tree live biomass (AGLB). AGLB increased significantly over the 2-yr intervals, exhibiting a mean rate of change of 1.65 Mg/ha/yr (bootstrapped 95% CI: 1.15, 2.79). The rate of change varied according to tree size class; understory and sub-canopy trees exhibited higher rates of change. Over the whole period, the rate of change was not related to soil or topographic features of the plots, but there was evidence that the relationships varied depending on the year of measurement. In the plots monitored between 2001 and 2003 we found a significant relationship between AGLB change and the soil textural gradient, but this relationship was not evident in plots monitored between 2002 and 2004. This suggests that both the temporal variation in the soil-biomass change relationship and the size structure of the forest need to be included in models of biomass change in Amazonia. We also noted that the rate of biomass change is sensitive to the equation used to estimate AGLB. Allometric models that incorporate wood-density data provide higher per plot AGLB estimates, but lower rates of change, suggesting that variations in floristic composition have important implications for carbon cycling in diverse tropical forests.

AB We examined structural and physiological traits relevant to the phenology of the tropical dry forest (TDF) pioneer tree Cochlospermum vitifolium. Despite marked seasonality in rainfall, meristem activity occurred throughout the year. Leaves were produced almost continuously during the rainy season, while leaf shedding started early during drought, before changes in soil water content were observed. Phenological activity under drought included flowering and fruiting of leafless trees; bud break and shoot extension took place before the end of the dry season. Low wood density of C. vitifolium stems (0.17 g/cm(3)) and lignotubers (0.14 g/cm(3)) provided water and starch storage needed to support phenological events such as branch extension, leaf flushing, and reproduction during the dry season, and probably also contributed to survival following mechanical damage and fire, typical of early TDF successional stages. Lignotuber water and starch contents showed substantial seasonal variation, declining from the beginning of the dry season to their lowest levels at the time of reproduction and dry-season flushing. Stems progressively replaced lignotubers as main storage organs as tree size increased. Evidence for a role of water stores in buffering daily water deficits was weak. Leaf water potentials remained above - 1.2 MPa and stomatal conductance below 350 mmol/m(2)/s, suggesting that gas exchange during the rainy season was limited to prevent xylem cavitation. Leaf shedding occurred when early-morning and mid-day Psi(L) converged at the rainy - dry season transition, without changes in lignotuber or soil water content, suggesting that leaves of C. vitifolium are closely tuned to atmospheric drought.

AB This study aimed to compare canopy herbivore diversity and resultant insect damage to vegetation in two distinct and adjacent ecosystems, specifically a dry forest ecosystem and a cerrado (savanna) ecosystem that occur together in an abrupt transition zone in southeastern Brazil. In the dry forest, the canopy was reached using a single rope climbing technique, whereas the shorter canopy of the cerrado was assessed using a 7 m ladder. Insect specimens were collected by beating the foliage, and 20 representative leaves were collected to calculate the specific leaf mass (SLM) and leaf area loss through herbivory. Also, we collected ten soil samples from each habitat to determine soil nutrient content. We sampled 118 herbivorous insects from ten families, mostly in dry forest trees (96 individuals belonging to 31 species). A higher abundance of chewing and sap-sucking insects were observed in dry forest trees than in cerrado trees. The same pattern was observed for the richness of chewers, with a higher degree of diversity of chewers found in dry forest trees than in cerrado trees. Herbivorous insects were not affected by SLM regardless of guild and habitat. However, we observed a negative correlation between the herbivory rate and the specific leaf mass (SLM). The cerrado trees showed a higher SLM and lower herbivory rates than trees occurring in the dry forest. These results suggest that herbivory rates in the transition dry forest-cerrado may be driven by soil nutrient content, which is thought to influence leaf sclerophylly.

AB Habitat loss and fragmentation can have severe negative and irreversible effects on biodiversity. We investigated the effects of forest fragmentation on frog diversity in Singapore because of its high rates of deforestation and the demonstration that frogs are some of the most sensitive species to habitat degradation. We surveyed frog species in 12 forest fragments varying from 11 to 935 ha. We compared differences in species richness, abundance, and Shannon's index in relation to forest fragment size, connectivity (distance between fragments), and breeding habitat heterogeneity. A total of 20 species from 12 genera and five families were encountered in 12 fragments. Larger fragments and those closer to larger fragments had higher species richness. Abundance, however, was not correlated with forest area or connectivity, but we found fewer individual frogs in the larger fragments. We also found that breeding habitat heterogeneity best explained frog species diversity and abundance in forest fragments. Fragments with a high diversity of breeding habitats had more species. We found no evidence to suggest that abundance and diversity are strongly correlated, particularly in disturbed areas, but that breeding habitat heterogeneity is an under-appreciated factor that should be considered when prioritizing areas for anuran conservation. Enriching breeding habitat heterogeneity, creating corridors between fragments, and reforesting degraded areas are some of the most beneficial strategies for preserving urban frog biodiversity.

AB Relative abundance indices are often used to compare species abundance between sites. The indices assume that species have similar detection probabilities, or that differences between detection probabilities are known and can be corrected for. Indices often consist of encounter frequencies of footprints, burrows, markings or photo captures along trails or transect lines, but the assumption of equal detection probabilities is rarely validated. This study analyzes detection probabilities of a range of Neotropical mammals on trails in dense secondary forests, using camera-trap and track data. Photo captures of the two large cats, jaguars (Panthera onca) and pumas (Puma concolor), were correlated solely with trail variables, while photo captures of their potential prey species had no correlation or negative correlation with trail variables. The Neotropical mammals varied greatly in their tendency to follow or cross trails based on footprints surveys. This indicates that camera locations on trails will have varying detection probability for these Neotropical mammals. Even the two similar-sized jaguars and pumas, occupying relatively similar niches, differed subtly in their use of trails. Pumas followed trails more completely while jaguars were more likely to deviate from trails. The ecological significance of these findings is that jaguars seem to be more willing to use the forest matrix away from trails than do pumas. We conclude that trail-based indices, such as photographic captures or tracks along trails, are not appropriate for comparison between Neotropical species, and not even between relatively similar species like jaguars and pumas.

ID FOREST; BIODIVERSITY; MANAGEMENT; BORNEO
AB The landscape approach is being used for initiatives that have the dual objectives of conserving biodiversity and alleviating poverty. However, working at such landscape scales greatly expands the level of ambition of conservation organizations and requires them to use skills that differ from those that they have traditionally deployed. Influencing landscape change requires major commitments for long periods of time and since there is still little evidence for the success of such approaches they should be used cautiously. Landscape programmes must be based on a comprehensive understanding of landscape dynamics and of the underlying drivers of social, economic and ecological change. Just as in any other investment in conservation it is important to set objectives in clear and measurable terms. Landscape approaches should therefore complement and not replace more conventional biodiversity conservation measures. They should be guided by scenarios agreed by concerned stakeholders, should be constructivist and in most cases their success will require major changes in the behavior of local people.

AB The complexity of factors driving tropical deforestation demand integrated approaches from concerned researchers and policy makers. Strict protection is sometimes the most appropriate mode of conservation, but conservation through management is often the better option. In either case, this essay highlights the importance of considering the social/cultural, economic, and political contexts in which these forests are threatened. By attempting to understand the cultural settings, institutional architectures and dynamics, and local expectations, and then by combining the concepts and tools of a range of disciplines, researchers will be more likely to forge lasting partnerships and increase their potential for sustained improvement in resource management and overall forest conservation.

AB Tropical cloud forests are considered humid ecosystems with frequent cloud cover down to the ground surface. However, seasonal variation in precipitation may induce short-term water stress. For canopy leaves, this water stress may also be a consequence of large atmospheric vapor pressure deficits. The objective of this work was to study five canopy cloud forest species to determine if there are restrictions to leaf gas exchange as a consequence of seasonality in precipitation and to daily water deficit due to air evaporative demand mainly during maximum incoming radiation hours. Seasonal daily courses of microclimatic variables (air temperature, relative humidity, photosynthetic photon flux density) and plant responses (leaf water potential, stomatal conductance, CO(2) assimilation rates, leaf nitrogen concentration) were measured at 2400 m asl in Monterrey, an intermontane valley of the Venezuelan Andes. A gradient in terms of responses to water stress conditions was observed between the species, with Clusia multiflora (a 46% reduction in stomatal conductance between seasons) as the most affected and Miconia resimoides (increased stomatal conductance) responding more favorably to slight water stress conditions. If we consider the limitations of water stress and/or light conditions on CO(2) assimilation we may arrange the species into those in which water stress conditions have a greater impact on leaf carbon gain, those where light conditions are determinant and one in which both water stress and light conditions may affect leaf carbon assimilation.

AB The distributions of 17 tree species with seeds or fruits that are commonly eaten or otherwise used by humans were studied in reference to anthropogenic soils in a seasonally dry lowland tropical forest in Bolivia. Two types of anthropogenic dark earths (ADEs) were identified: terra preta (TP: darkened with charcoal fragments and with abundant pottery shards) and terra mulata (TM: somewhat darkened but with little or no pottery). In 216 ha, we compared the densities of trees > 10 cm dbh of useful species in nine TP patches, three TM patches, and six areas with nonanthropogenic soils (N-ADE). The TP, which covers approximately 20 percent of the sample area, has higher contents of organic matter, extractable P, and extractable Ca than N-ADE soils, as well as higher pH and extractable P than TM. TM has organic matter and Ca contents similar to N-ADE soils but significantly less extractable K. In general, TP has higher nutrient content than surrounding soils, both at the surface (0-10 cm) and deeper in the profile (40-50 cm). Despite these differences in soil fertility and contrary to our expectations, none of the 17 tree species were concentrated on TP perhaps because interactions between local dispersal agents and natural disturbances have masked historical patterns. Alternatively, past inhabitants of the study area may have enriched forests with useful tree species in areas where they were not practicing the intensive soil husbandry that results in ADEs.

AB Epiphytic plants are a dominant component of the rain forest canopy biota. They represent a significant proportion of canopy plant biomass and diversity, play a key role in nutrient cycling, and support highly abundant and diverse animal communities. Understanding the factors affecting their distribution in this three-dimensional habitat is consequently of great importance, not least because they may be particularly vulnerable to climate change and habitat conversion. Here we investigate how canopy architecture affects the distribution of two species of bird's nest fern (Asplenium spp.) in pristine rain forest. Both species were found at high abundances (Asplenium phyllitidis: 136/ha, SE +/- 31.6, Asplenium nidus: 44/ha, SE +/- 9.2) and their distributions were differentially affected by canopy architecture. Asplenium phyllitidis was found only at heights < 30 m in areas with a thicker lower canopy layer. Asplenium nidus was found at all heights in the canopy and was associated with emergent trees and areas with an open understory. Larger A. phyllitidis were found higher in the canopy while larger A. nidus were found on trunks and branches with a wider diameter. Asplenium nidus seems adapted to withstand the hot dry conditions in the upper canopy and in gaps, and its size is consequently limited only by the size of its support. Asplenium phyllitidis is dominant in areas that are cooler and damper, and so the growth rate of individuals may be limited by light levels. We discuss possible implications of this partitioning for epiphyte communities in the face of climate change and habitat conversion.

AB Richness and occupancy patterns of epiphyll bryophytes in a fragmented landscape of tropical rain forests in northeastern Brazil (Murici Ecological Station) were investigated to assess the influence of regional and local disappearance of habitat on epiphyllous metapopulation indicators. Bryophytes were collected from ten forest fragments, from the fragment's border to 100 m inside the forest. The number of colonized phorophytes and the cover on leaves were scored. Decreasing trends in regional and local abundance linked to habitat loss were observed, which may be related to the sexual and asexual expression. Although fertility was not related to constancy in the fragments, frequently fertile species colonized more sites within fragments than infertile species. Landscape metrics and indicators of habitat quality explained better the variation in epiphyll richness and occupancy than distance from the forest's edge. This suggests that the abrupt habitat quality modification resulting from edge creation is secondary in the area studied, while irreversible landscape modifications still play an important role. The results add to empirical support that metapopulations are prone to negative and long-term effects in fragmented landscapes. Thus, the selection of priority areas for conservation must take into account the remaining amount of habitat as well as the connectivity between the landscape's patches.

AB Habitat fragmentation may affect the reproductive success of plant populations in many different ways. Thus, negative, neutral, or positive plant responses can be observed, according to the balance of the different interactions. Variables related to mutualistic and antagonistic interactions (pollinator activity and gall occurrence, respectively) were measured on Byrsonima sericea populations of a fragmented seashore area (restinga) in southeastern Brazil. Pollinator visits to the oil-bearing flowers, insect gall occurrence on stems and inflorescences, and fruit set of B. sericea were compared between three small (up to 0.3 ha) and three large (14.0-99.0 ha) fragments. MANOVA showed differences between fragment classes. Nevertheless, a posteriori univariate ANOVA showed that the pollinator visit frequency was more than twofold higher in small fragments, and that gall occurrence and fruit set did not show significant differences between small and large fragments. These results suggest that the habitat fragmentation does not affect the female reproductive success of B. sericea in the studied restinga areas because resource availability seems to be a more important factor for fruit set than pollen limitation due to pollination failure. This is the first work assessing the effects of habitat fragmentation in restinga areas, which are intensely impacted by urbanization, so that no generalization about the fragmentation consequences can still be made for this ecosystem.

AB Understanding the impact of hunting on wildlife populations is crucial to achieving sustainability and requires knowledge of prey abundance responses to different levels of exploitation. While the abundance of primates has been shown to respond independently to hunting and habitat, habitat is rarely considered simultaneously when evaluating the impacts of hunting. Furthermore, the importance of these two factors in determining the abundance of other species has not been well investigated. We evaluate the independent effects of hunting and habitat on the abundance of a diverse assemblage of species, using a series of predictions and data from a study in Equatorial Guinea. Line transect surveys in sites of varying hunting intensity and habitat, and weekly interviews with hunters on current hunting effort in each site, were conducted. We also consider the role of past hunting, and discuss the interrelationships between hunting and habitat variables. We show that for primates, hunting is important in determining abundance, while for rodents and duikers, habitat is more important. Our findings show that the effects of hunting and habitat on abundance vary greatly between species, are often confounded and require an approach that isolates their independent effects to determine the true impact of hunting. Conservation managers must consider and incorporate habitat heterogeneity when managing hunting systems, taking into account the way in which the relative importance of these factors can vary between species.

AB Leaf-cutting ants (LCAs) profoundly benefit from edge creation in Neotropical forests, where they act as a keystone species and disturbance agent. In view of their poorly explored population dynamics, the question arises whether high densities of LCAs are a transitional or a persisting phenomenon. We studied the temporal variation of LCA colony densities at the edge of the Brazilian Atlantic forest. At physically stable edges of an old forest fragment, densities of Atta cephalotes and Atta sexdens (11 and five times higher in a 50 m edge zone in comparison with the forest interior) persisted over a 4-yr interval (2001-2005) with no significant difference in densities between years. Species-specific per colony growth rates ranged from 12 to -5 percent/yr, suggesting that populations were approximately at equilibrium. High rates of colony turnover (little less than 50% in 4 yr) indicated an average colony life span of about 7 yr-a life expectancy considerably lower than previous estimates for Atta colonies. Stable, hyper-abundant populations of LCAs accord with the constantly high availability of palatable pioneer vegetation (the preferred food source of LCAs) at forest edges and are expected to persist in time as long as forests are characterized by high edge to interior ratios, with potentially long-lasting consequences for the ecosystem.

AB Fig trees (Ficus) and their obligate pollinating wasps (Hymenoptera, Chalcidoidea, Agaonidae) are a classic example of a coevolved mutualism. Pollinating wasps are attracted to figs only when figs are receptive. It has been shown that figs will lose their attraction to pollinators sooner in monoecious and male dioecious figs when multiple pollinators have entered the enclosed inflorescence. However, little is known about the nature of the stimulus inducing the loss of attraction. By conducting experiments on the functionally dioecious fig, Ficus hispida, we show that (1) different stimuli induce the loss of attraction in each sex, pollination in female figs, and oviposition in male figs; and (2) foundress number affects the loss of attraction in both sexes only when the prerequisites (i.e., pollination in female figs and oviposition in male figs) have been satisfied. In general, the more foundresses that enter, the earlier the fig will lose its receptivity. We argue that the stimuli in male and female figs are adaptations to the fulfillment of its respective reproduction.

AB Floral characteristics often indicate the pollinators' functional group visiting the plant and the pollination syndromes associated with them. This idea has been challenged in the past decades due to increasing evidence that most plants, including those exhibiting floral syndromes, are visited by large arrays of species that differ in their effectiveness as pollinators. Our study focuses on Mecardonia tenella (Plantaginaceae) from the Araucaria forest of southern Brazil, which exhibits characteristics of the oil flower pollination syndrome. However, it is visited by three types of functional groups of bees: male orchid bees, oil-collecting bees, and pollen-seeking bees. The relative contribution of each functional group to the plant's reproductive success was estimated based on their pollen load, visitation frequency, and morphology. We assessed resources, phenology, and breeding system of M. tenella. Our results indicate that flowers lack nectar, but volatiles, lipids, and pollen are resources that can be gathered by visitors. This combination of floral traits and visitors' assemblage makes M. tenella a challenge to the concept of pollination syndromes. Our findings indicate that the current interactions may not reflect the circumstances under which some floral traits of this plant were selected.

AB Plant resins are used by stingless bees for nest construction and maintenance. To reveal factors that influence the bees' decision about where and when to collect resin, resin collection was studied in ten stingless bee species (Apidae, Meliponini) collecting resin at natural and artificially induced wounds of nine tree species in Borneo. Artificially induced wounds were found by bees within 1-2 d. The number of foragers at artificial wounds increased during the subsequent 5 d until resin secretion stopped or the resin hardened. At natural resin wounds, species identity and number of foragers remained constant during the observation period. Bees collected resin from some trees and ignored others. Agathis borneensis (Araucariaceae) was the most attractive resin source. The bees' visitation rate did not correlate significantly with resin wound size. Inter- and intraspecific aggression occurred at ten resin wounds. In Tetragonilla collina and Tetragonula melanocephala, we additionally recorded resin intake at colony entrances. The proportion of workers retuning with resin varied considerably between colonies. We observed attacks by ants at three of our eight focal colonies, which resulted in a significant increase in resin intake while the nest was under attack and until 1-2 d after the attack had stopped. The increase in resin collection triggered by ant attacks was even stronger than the increase following a manual destruction of the nest entrance tube.

AB In Neotropical regions, fruit bats are among the most important components of the remaining fauna in disturbed landscapes. These relatively small-bodied bats are well-known dispersal agents for many small-seeded plant species, but are assumed to play a negligible role in the dispersal of large-seeded plants. We investigated the importance of the small tent-roosting bat Artibeus watsoni for dispersal of large seeds in the Sarapiqui Basin, Costa Rica. We registered at least 43 seed species > 8 mm beneath bat roosts, but a species accumulation curve suggests that this number would increase with further sampling. Samples collected beneath bat feeding roosts had, on average, 10 times more seeds and species than samples collected 5 m away from bat feeding roosts. This difference was generally smaller in small, disturbed forest patches. Species-specific abundance of seeds found beneath bat roosts was positively correlated with abundance of seedlings, suggesting that bat dispersal may influence seedling recruitment. Our study demonstrates a greater role of small frugivorous bats as dispersers of large seeds than previously thought, particularly in regions where populations of large-bodied seed dispersers have been reduced or extirpated by hunting.

AB Seed dispersal by small primates may be particularly relevant in areas where populations of larger frugivores have been reduced or extinguished by hunting and/or habitat disturbance. In this context, the aim of this study was to evaluate the role of the golden-headed lion tamarin Leontopithecus chrysomelas as a seed disperser in Atlantic forest remnants in Brazil. To this end, we opportunistically collected feces deposited during observations on the feeding behavior of two groups of golden-headed lion tamarins ranging in the degraded areas of the Una Biological Reserve, Bahia, Brazil, from February 2006 to January 2007. We collected 587 fecal samples, of which 524 contained seeds from 24 plant species, distributed over 13 families. Disregarding seeds of < 3 mm, the majority of seeds recovered were bromeliad seeds. In general, ingestion of seeds by golden-headed lion tamarins did not improve the germination proportion or decrease the germination delay of seeds, with the exception of Aechmea spp. seeds. The tamarins encountered different habitats during their daily activity period, while feeding and defecating. Consequently, some seeds were transported to different habitats including disturbed areas. Thus, the role of seed dispersal in combination with the daily movement pattern of L. chrysomelas contributes to the persistence of fruit plants and epiphyte species and to the natural regeneration process within Atlantic forest remnants.

AB The most generalized mechanism of seed dispersal in tropical and subtropical forests is dispersal by vertebrates. The pattern of seed dispersal and germination capacity of dispersed seeds can determine the seed disperser quality because both affect the postdispersal fate of dispersed seeds. Animals' behavior is an important determinant of seed deposition pattern. One of most abundant frugivores of Neotropical forests are howler monkeys Alouatta spp., so my aim was to evaluate the potential quality of Alouatta caraya as a seed disperser, obtaining details of: (1) seed deposition pattern, (2) behavioral context of defecations, and (3) germination capacity of dispersed seeds. During 2 years the seed shadow created by howlers and the behavioral context of depositions was examined in the Parana flooded forest, and germination tests were conducted in the laboratory. Black and gold howler monkeys consumed fruits of five canopy trees, three understory trees, one shrub, and two vines. Howlers dispersed seeds in a complex pattern: 35 percent (337 scats) of scats were deposited individually, and 65 percent were deposited in big latrines associated with the main sleeping trees and in small latrines associated with secondary sleeping trees and confrontations at territory edges. From 261 dispersal distances recorded, 20 and 40 m were the mode, but 57 percent of distances were > 50 m and 31 percent were > 100 m. Germination speed increased significantly in ingested seeds of Banara arguta, Ocotea diospyrifolia and Eugenia punicifolia. The seed deposition pattern generated by A. caraya may produce a diversification of environmental conditions for dispersed seeds that should be considered in future evaluations.

AB The Nevados del Aconquija (5500 m) and Cumbres Calchaquies (4600 m) are isolated mountain ranges that contain at least three physiognomic units in their eastern slopes: Neotropical rainforests, Andean grasslands and High Andean Steppes. Despite phytogeographical similarities, the two ranges differ in the amount and spatial distribution of rainfall over the elevation gradient. We studied terrestrial small mammals by direct trapping in two altitudinal transects on the eastern slope of the two mountain ranges. We recorded the changes in richness and species composition, as well as the relationships between species and microhabitats at each altitudinal level. The results show a similar structure of the small mammal assemblage in the two ranges. The largest differences, in terms of species composition, were registered at lower elevation forests, and faunal affinities increased with elevation to the point of finding identical species composition at the top of the mountains. Species richness showed a clear curvilinear pattern with a peak at the upper limit of the forests. Our findings suggest that total rainfall has an important influence on the composition and abundance of small mammal species but apparently not on the species richness along the elevation gradient. The highest values of species richness were observed at the sites where a contact between two different physiognomic units exists. These results indicate that habitat heterogeneity plays an important role in allowing the juxtaposition of small terrestrial mammal assemblages of the highlands and lowlands at a given point, contributing significantly to the considerable diversity of species observed in intermediate altitudinal sites.

AB Many animal populations are forced to inhabit very small forest patches, which may threaten their long-term survival. In some cases, animals in these forest remnants are able to supplement their diet by using resources outside of their home patch, a process named 'landscape supplementation'. Although this is probably a key process for population survival in fragmented landscapes, little is known about the ability of most animal species to move through the matrix and feed from different landscape elements. In this paper we report several cases of landscape supplementation by two groups of Mexican mantled howler monkeys Alouatta palliata mexicana inhabiting two different forest patches in Los Tuxtlas, Mexico. Our observations show that howler monkeys used several landscape elements, such as isolated trees, live fences and neighboring forest patches to supplement their diet. These observations underline the importance of these landscape elements for the survival of forest-dependent animals in highly fragmented landscapes, as they can provide important food resources and, hence, can be considered as potential extensions of their home range. However, the degree of protection the landowner provides to howler monkeys and proper management of these landscape elements are key aspects in determining the use of these elements by these animals.

AB Conserving tropical ecosystems is one of the foremost challenges of the 21st century. Lately, conservation efforts have focused on advancing conservation through dialogue and interaction with and among diverse stakeholders. Knowledge sharing, and specifically the transfer of scientific knowledge, can raise ecological awareness among stakeholders and is necessary to facilitate dialogue, yet the communication of tropical scientific research to local stakeholders is rarely effectively implemented. Such a communication gap potentially undermines the conservation and management of natural resources. The papers in this special section highlight the difficulties and benefits of sharing ecological knowledge, as well as the underlying reasons for why a research-implementation gap has arisen.

AB Most of the world's population that derives their livelihoods or part of their livelihoods from forests are out of the information loop. Exclusion of public users of natural resources from access to scientific research results is not an oversight; it is a systemic problem that has costly ramifications for conservation and development. Results of a survey of 268 researchers from 29 countries indicate that institutional incentives support the linear, top-down communication of results through peer-reviewed journal articles, which often guarantees positive performance measurement. While the largest percentage of respondents (34%) ranked scientists as the most important audience for their work, only 15 percent of respondents considered peer-reviewed journals effective in promoting conservation and/or development. Respondents perceived that local initiatives (27%) and training (16%) were likely to lead to success in conservation and development; but few scientists invest in these activities. Engagement with the media (5%), production of training and educational materials (4%) and popular publications (5%) as outlets for scientific findings was perceived as inconsequential (< 14%) in measuring scientific performance. Less than 3 percent of respondents ranked corporate actors as an important audience for their work. To ensure science is shared with those who need it, a shift in incentive structures is needed that rewards actual impact rather than only 'high-impact' journals. Widely used approaches and theoretical underpinnings from the social sciences, which underlie popular education and communication for social change, could enhance communication by linking knowledge and action in conservation biology.

AB It is widely accepted that there is a considerable gap between the science of conservation biology and the design and execution of biodiversity conservation projects in the field and science is failing to inform the practice of conservation. There are many reasons why this implementation gap exists. A high proportion of papers published in scientific journals by conservation biologists are seldom read outside of the academic world and there are few incentives for academics to convert their science into practice. In turn, field practitioners rarely document their field experiences and experiments in a manner that can meaningfully inform conservation scientists. Issues related to access to scientific literature, scientific relevance in multidisciplinary environments, donor expectations and a lack of critical analysis at all levels of conservation theory and practice are factors that exacerbate the divide. The contexts in which conservation biologists and field practitioners operate are also often highly dissimilar, and each has differing professional responsibilities and expectations that compromise the ability to learn from each other's expertise. Building on recent debate in the literature, and using case studies to illustrate the issues that characterize the divide, this paper draws on the authors' experiences of project management as well as academic research. We identify five key issues related to information exchange: access to scientific literature, levels of scientific literacy, lack of interdisciplinarity, questions of relevance and lack of sharing of conservation-related experiences and suggest new ways of working that could assist in bridging the gap between conservation scientists and field practitioners.

AB Local communities are important stakeholders in resource management and conservation efforts, particularly in the developing world. Although evidence is mixed in suggesting that these resident stakeholders are optimal forest stewards, it is highly unlikely that large tracts of tropical forests will be conserved without engaging local people who depend on them daily for their livelihoods. Stakeholders, who reside in biodiverse ecosystems like tropical forests, are the largest direct users and ultimate decision-makers of forest fate, can be important investors in conservation, harbor local ecological knowledge that complements Western science and frequently have long-term legitimate claims on lands where they reside. Research partnerships with local stakeholders can increase research relevance, enhance knowledge exchange and result in greater conservation success. Different phases of the research cycle present distinct opportunities for partnership, with flexibility in timing, approaches and strategies depending on researcher and local stakeholder needs and interests. Despite being the last step in the research process, dissemination of results can be the best starting point for researchers interested in experimenting with local stakeholder engagement. Still, tropical biologists might not choose to partner with local people because of lack of institutional rewards, insufficient training in stakeholder engagement, insecure research infrastructure in community settings, and time and funding limitations. Although not appropriate in all cases and despite significant challenges, some biological scientists and research institutions have successfully engaged local stakeholders in the research process, proving mutually beneficial for investigators and local people alike and resulting in important innovations in tropical biology and conservation.

AB There is a well-acknowledged communication or knowledge gap between scientists and decision-makers. Many scientists who take on the challenge of narrowing this gap operate on the understanding that their role is to communicate their findings in a one-way flow of information: from science to decision-makers. However, to be effective scientists must engage in an ongoing social learning process with decision-makers, and regard themselves as facilitators, and also as one among many stakeholders who have valid and important ecological knowledge. The developing world poses some particular challenges in this regard, specifically in terms of the large number of local level subsistence resources users who are important de facto decision-makers. We examine four natural resource management case studies from South Africa that differ in spatial scale and complexity, ranging from a single village to a whole biome. We distil seven lessons to help guide development of social learning processes and organizations in similar situations relating to natural resource planning and management. The lessons pertain to: maintaining 'key individuals' within social learning processes; the role of researchers; the formulation of research questions that social learning processes require adaptive long-term funding and capacity support; that local resource users are key decision-makers in developing countries; some perspectives on knowledge; and the need to measure research success.

AB Environmental research is often conducted independently of the community in which the environment is situated, with transfer of results into policy and on-ground action occurring independently of the community's interests or aspirations. Increasingly the need for greater community involvement in the research process has been recognized. For community members, however, such engagement usually involves trade-offs. While it is often assumed that community members should participate voluntarily because they will gain from the research, any benefits from knowledge, understanding and a capacity to influence the research have to be offset against time and potential loss of unremunerated intellectual property. We argue, using case studies from tropical Australia and Africa, that a more effective means of engagement and knowledge transfer is training and remuneration of community members as coresearchers. This engagement is much more than payment for labor-it is investment in local intellectual property and requires researcher humility, power-sharing and recognition that access to research funding provides no moral or intellectual authority. Further, we argue that, for effective adoption of research results, community members need to be part of negotiated agreements on the initial nature of the research to ensure it answers questions of genuine local relevance and that local researchers have the capacity to place locally conducted research into a wider context. We argue that immediate rewards for involvement not only secure engagement but, where appropriate, are likely to lead to effective implementation of research results, enhanced local capacity and greater equity in intellectual power-sharing.

ID CONSERVATION BIOLOGY; EDUCATION; AMAZONIA
AB Tropical biologists are exploring ways to expand their role as researchers through knowledge exchange with local stakeholders. Graduate students are well positioned for this broader role, particularly when supported by graduate programs. We ask: (1) how can graduate students effectively engage in knowledge exchange during their research; and (2) how can university programs prepare young scientists to take on this partnership role? We present a conceptual framework with three levels at which graduate students can exchange knowledge with stakeholders (information sharing, skill building, and knowledge generation) and discuss limitations of each. Examples of these strategies included disseminating preliminary research results to southern African villages, building research skills of Brazilian undergraduate students through semester-long internships, and jointly developing and implementing a forest ecology research and training program with one community in the Amazon estuary. Students chose strategies based on stakeholders' interests, research goals, and a realistic evaluation of student capacity and skill set. As strategies became more complex, time invested, skills mobilized, and strength of relationships between students and stakeholders increased. Graduate programs can prepare students for knowledge exchange with partners by developing specialized skills training, nurturing external networks, offering funding, maximizing strengths of universities in developed and developing regions through partnership, and evaluating knowledge exchange experiences. While balancing the needs of academia with those of stakeholders is challenging, the benefits of enhancing local scientific capacity and generating more locally relevant research for improved conservation may be worth the risks associated with implementing this type of graduate training model.

AB Knowledge sharing between scientists and nonscientist stakeholders is necessary to implement research findings in an appropriate and effective manner within the context of the environment and conservation sectors. Yet scientific ecological knowledge is rarely shared and transferred effectively. This special section has addressed a number of opportunities and barriers to the improvement of scientific communication and knowledge transfer with respect to environmental management in tropical settings. A main challenge is seen in creating a research 'impact-metric' system, which is fundamental to foster knowledge sharing with institutional research incentives. Partnering with local institutions and research centers as well as participatory research methods will promote effective knowledge exchange. Research relevance and impact will be improved by matching interdisciplinary research with local capacity building and support through research activities. We conclude that training the next generation of tropical biologists through more effective knowledge sharing will be crucial to the long term success of scientifically based environmental management in tropical regions.

ID ECOSYSTEMS
AB In 1966 Eugene P. Odum delivered a speech before the Ecological Society of America that transformed the way ecologists looked at succession. His comparison of mature and successional systems lead ecologists to place secondary forests in an inferior position relative to mature ones to the point that today, prominent tropical biologists argue for and against the conservation value of secondary forests. Nevertheless, we live in the era of secondary forests that is rapidly giving way to a new era of novel tropical forests. Research in Puerto Rico documents the emergence of novel forests, which are different in terms of species composition, dominance, and relative importance of species from forests that were present before the island was deforested. These novel forests emerged without assistance. They are a natural response to the new environmental conditions created by human activity. Natural processes have remixed or reassembled native and introduced plant and animal species into novel communities adapted to anthropogenic environmental conditions. Novel forests are expected to protect soils, cycle nutrients, support wildlife, store carbon, maintain watershed functions, and mitigate species extinctions. The dawn of the age of tropical novel forests is upon us and must not be ignored.

AB Most predictions of vegetation responses to anthropogenic climate change over the next 100 yr are based on plant physiological tolerances and do not account for the ability of plant species to migrate over the distances required in the time available, or the impact of habitat fragmentation on this ability. This review assesses the maximum routine dispersal distances achievable in tropical East Asia and their vulnerability to human impacts. Estimates for various plant-vector combinations range from < 10 m, for species dispersed by ants or mechanical means, to > 10 km for some species dispersed by wind (tiny seeds), water, fruit pigeons, large fruit bats (tiny seeds), elephants, rhinoceroses, and people. Most plant species probably have maximum dispersal distances in the 100-1000 m range, but the widespread, canopy-dominant Dipterocarpaceae and Fagaceae are normally dispersed < 100 m. Large fruit bats and fruit pigeons are particularly important for long-distance dispersal in fragmented landscapes and should be protected from hunting. The maximum seed dispersal distances estimated in this study are potentially sufficient for many plant species to track temperature changes in steep topography, but are far too small for a significant role in mitigating climate change impacts in the lowlands, where temperature and rainfall gradients are much more shallow.

AB In this study, we investigated the pattern of floristic similarity as a function of geographical distances and environmental variability in well-drained uplands (terra firme) in Colombian Amazonia. The study site comprised three National Natural Parks, Tinigua, Chiribiquete, and Amacayacu, located in different geological units that represent a soil fertility gradient linked to parental materials. Differences in species richness between sites were compared using rarefaction analysis. A clear floristic transition appeared in the east-west direction following a soil fertility gradient along the first PCoA axis. In multiple regression analyses based on distance matrices, both geographical distances and geology explained 64 percent of the total floristic variation. Geographical distances alone accounted for 12 percent of variation in floristic similarities among plots, while geology alone accounted for 1 percent, and the joint effect of both explained 51 percent of the floristic variation. The species richness trend supports the existence of a latitudinal corridor southward of the geographical Equator in the Amazon basin, where tree diversity reaches the maximum expected values. A coupled effect of stochastic dispersal limitation and habitat specialization would certainly appear to be an appropriate explanation for tree species turnover in terra firme forests in Colombian Amazonia, strongly emphasizing that competition and neutrality must be supplementary rather than mutually exclusive processes. This result pinpoints the effect of dispersal on floral mixing as an ongoing active process for structuring tree communities in NW Amazonia, and the size of the reserves as a relevant issue to protect rare species from extinction by chance.

AB Secondary forests are a vital part of the tropical landscape, and their worldwide extent and importance continues to increase. Here, we present the largest chronosequence data set on forest succession in the wet tropics that includes both secondary and old-growth sites. We performed 0.1 ha vegetation inventories in 30 sites in northeastern Costa Rica, including seven old-growth forests and 23 secondary forests on former pastures, ranging from 10 to 42 yr. The secondary forest sites were formerly pasture for intervals of < 1-25 yr. Aboveground biomass in secondary forests recovered rapidly, with sites already exhibiting values comparable to old growth after 21-30 yr, and biomass accumulation was not impacted by the length of time that a site was in pasture. Species richness reached old-growth levels in as little as 30 yr, although sites that were in pasture for > 10 yr had significantly lower species richness. Forest cover near the sites at the time of forest establishment did not significantly impact biomass or species richness, and the species composition of older secondary forest sites (> 30 yr) converged with that of old growth. These results emphasize the resilience of tropical ecosystems in this region and the high conservation value of secondary forests.

AB Lianas are an integral part of tropical forest ecosystems, which usually respond strongly to severe disturbances, such as logging. To compare the effect of different logging systems on the lianas diversity in tropical rain forest, we recorded all lianas and trees >= 1 cm dbh in two 40-year-old forest sites after clear cutting (CC) and selective cutting (SC) as well as in an old-growth (OG) lowland tropical rain forest on Hainan Island in south China. Results showed that OG contained fewer liana stems and lower species richness (stems: 261, richness: 42 in 1 ha) than CC (606, 52) and SC (727, 50). However, OG had the highest Fisher's alpha diversity index (17.3) and species richness per stem (0.184). Species composition and dbh class distribution of lianas varied significantly with different logging systems. The mean liana dbh in OG (22.1 cm) were higher than those in CC (7.0 cm) and SC (10.4 cm). Stem twining was the most frequent climbing mechanism represented in the forest, as shown by the greatest species richness, abundance, basal area, and host tree number with this mechanism. The percent of host tree stems >= 4 cm dbh hosting at least one liana individual in SC (39%) was higher than CC (23%) and OG (19.5%). Large host trees (dbh >= 60 cm) were more likely to be infested by lianas in SC and OG. Our study demonstrated that logging disturbance could significantly change the composition and structure of liana communities in the lowland tropical rain forest of south China.

AB Stream shredders play an important role in the breakdown of allochthonous leaf litter-a well-known, key process in temperate headwater streams. In contrast, it has been suggested that litter breakdown in tropical streams is driven by microorganisms, shredders being scarce or absent. We propose that shredders have been overlooked in some tropical streams for two reasons: (1) assuming that tropical shredders belong to the same taxa as temperate ones, without determining the diet of tropical litter fauna; and (2) the small spatial scale of most tropical stream studies, which do not account for intra- and inter-site comparisons. We explored shredder abundance and species richness in six streams in each of two tropical regions, the Australian wet tropics (AWT) and Panama (PAN), finding 734 individuals of 12 shredder species in AWT and 391 individuals of 16 species in PAN. Shredder species richness was positively related to altitude in AWT, but not in PAN. Shredder contribution to total leaf breakdown in the field was 24 +/- 3 SE percent in AWT and negligible in PAN, but this was probably due to the unsuccessful colonization of experimental cages by PAN shredders. In the laboratory, shredder contribution to total leaf breakdown was higher than in the field (35%+/- 2 SE in AWT and 64%+/- 3 SE in PAN) and varied with leaf decomposability. Our results support earlier indications that shredders are not scarce or functionally unimportant in the tropics, and suggest that their contribution to litter processing should be determined along altitudinal gradients.

AB Litter-nesting ants are diverse and abundant in tropical forests, but the factors structuring their communities are poorly known. Here we present results of the first study to examine the impact of natural variation in flooding on a highly diverse (21 genera, 77 species) litter-nesting ant community in a primary Amazonian forest. Fifty-six 3 x 3 m plots experiencing strong variation in flooding and twenty-eight 3 x 3 m terra firme plots were exhaustively searched for litter-nesting ants to determine patterns of density, species richness and species composition. In each plot, flooding, litter depth, twig availability, canopy cover, plant density, percent soil nitrogen, carbon, and phosphorus were measured. Degree of flooding, measured as flood frequency and flood interval, had the strongest impact on ant density in flooded forest. Flooding caused a linear decrease in ant abundance, potentially due to a reduction of suitable nesting sites. However, its influence on species richness varied: low-disturbance habitat had species richness equal to terra firme forest after adjusting for differences in density. The composition of ant genera and species varied among flood categories; some groups known to contain specialist predators were particularly intolerant to flooding. Hypoponera STD10 appeared to be well-adapted to highly flooded habitat. Although flooding did not appear to increase species richness or abundance at the habitat scale, low-flooding habitat contained a mixture of species found in the significantly distinct ant communities of terra firme and highly flooded habitat.

AB In the tropics, several ant species are obligate inhabitants of leaf pouches and other specialized structures in plants known as myrmecophytes. However, the cues used by ant queens to locate suitable host-plants following dispersal remain poorly understood. Here we tested the hypothesis that Pheidole minutula queens use volatiles to distinguish their host Maieta guianensis (Melastomataceae) from other sympatric myrmecophytes. To do so, we used a Y-tube olfactometer to quantify the preference for volatiles of different plant species. Our results indicate that P. minutula queens discriminate the chemical volatiles produced by its host-plant from those of other sympatric ant-plant species. However, queens failed to distinguish the volatiles of Maieta from those of the ant-plant Tococa bullifera (Melastomataceae), with which P. minutula is not mutualistically associated. Nevertheless, a strong preference for Maieta over Tococa was observed during a subsequent bioassay, where the ants had physical contact with a domatium of each plant species. These results suggest that additional, short distance mechanisms are also necessary for host discrimination. Overall, our findings suggest that the high degree of compartmentalization observed in symbiotic ant-plant relationships is achieved, at least in part, by the relatively high degree of specificity in host selection displayed by foundress queens.

AB Because of the large differences between flower buds and leaves as food resources we predict that florivore caterpillars compared with folivores would present: (1) higher degree of dietary specificity; (2) higher abundance; and (3) lower species richness. Based on emerged adults from caterpillars collected on leaves and inflorescences our results showed that the florivore fauna was strongly dominated by a few species with higher abundance and dietary specificity than the folivore fauna.

In a dry environment of southeastern Sri Lanka, I examined 290 elephant dung piles and found a total of six frogs from three different species in 1.7 percent (N=5) of the dung piles. This suggests a facilitative role of elephants by providing habitat for amphibians.

AB Vertebrates play a fundamental role in the dispersal of Neotropical trees, generating different seed shadows according to their physical and behavioral features. Tapirs are capable of consuming great quantities of large fruits, and they defecate seeds far from parent trees. For instance, intact seeds of the palm Syagrus romanzoffiana have been found in tapir dung piles in the Atlantic Forest of southeastern Brazil, suggesting that tapirs effectively disperse this species. However, recruitment was not examined therein. We studied tapir endozoochory of large and medium seeds in the semi-deciduous Atlantic Forest of Argentina by examining dung piles found within Iguazu National Park. We recorded dung-pile positions to evaluate the spatial distribution. We also counted the number of juveniles in 2 x 2 m quadrats placed on old dung piles in latrines, beneath adults and in random sites to estimate recruitment levels. Syagrus romanzoffiana seeds were present in 98 percent of dung piles, averaging > 200 seeds/dung pile, indicating that this species constitutes the main fruit component in the tapir's diet. Dung piles showed a clumped deposition pattern reflecting the use of latrines. Juvenile recruitment in latrines was 21 times higher than that of under-adult sites and 500 times greater than in random sites, and correlated with the frequency of use of the areas. We concluded that the lowland tapir is a major disperser of S. romanzoffiana. Given that this palm can be considered a keystone species, a disruption of this interaction might affect the entire community of frugivores in the long term.

AB Global warming exacerbates threats to biodiversity as ecological systems shift in response to altered climatic conditions. Yet the long-term survival of populations at direct risk from climate change may also be undermined by local factors such as infectious disease or anthropogenic harvest, which leave smaller and more isolated populations increasingly vulnerable to the rapid pace of global change. We review current and future threats to an exemplar tropical waterfowl species, magpie geese Anseranas semipalmata, and focus on the potential synergies between infectious diseases, harvest, and climate change. We outline viral, bacterial, and fungal pathogens likely to cause disease in geese, and give mention to parasites. Further, we elaborate on a previously developed, spatially explicit population viability model to simulate demographic responses to hunting and novel or enhanced disease outbreaks due to climate change. With no harvest, the simulated disease epizootics only threatened metapopulation viability when both mortality rate was high and outbreaks were regular (a threshold response). However, when contemporary site-specific harvest is included as an additive impact, the response to disease severity and probability was linear. We recommend field research to test these hypotheses linking drivers of waterfowl population decline to disease-climate change interactions.

AB Growth-survival trade-offs play an important role in niche differentiation of tropical tree species in relation to light-gradient partitioning. However, the mechanisms that determine differential species performance in response to light and soil resource availability are poorly understood. To examine responses to light and soil nutrient availability, we grew seedlings of five tropical tree species for 12 mo at < 2 and 18 percent full sunlight and in two soil types representing natural contrasts in nutrient availability within a lowland dipterocarp forest in North Borneo. We chose two specialists of nutrient-rich and nutrient-poor soils, respectively, and one habitat generalist. Across all species, growth was higher in high than low light and on more nutrient rich soil. Although species differed in growth rates, the ranking of species, in terms of growth, was consistent across the four treatments. Nutrient-rich soils improved seedling survival and increased growth of three species even under low light. Slower-growing species increased root allocation and reduced specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf area ratio (LAR) in response to decreased nutrient supply. All species increased LAR in response to low light. Maximum growth rates were negatively correlated with survival in the most resource-limited environment. Nutrient-poor soil specialists had low maximum growth rates but high survival at low resource availability. Specialists of nutrient-rich soils, plus the habitat generalist, had the opposite suite of traits. Fitness component trade-offs may be driven by both light and belowground resource availability. These trade-offs contribute to differentiation of tropical tree species among habitats defined by edaphic variation.

AB Folivory may indirectly impact plant reproduction through changes in sexual expression (i.e., number or proportion of male and female flowers produced), which influence plant-pollinator interactions via changes in pollinator preference or efficiency. This study is an experimental evaluation of the effect that defoliation has on sex expression in the monoecious shrub Cnidoscolus aconitifolius, how such effect varies across sites, as well as how such changes indirectly affect pollinator visitation rates. The present study used three populations of C. aconitifolius, each one located in a different site in Yucatan (Mexico): pasture, deciduous forest and subdeciduous medium height forest and three levels of defoliation: 50 percent, 100 percent, and a control (no damage). Results showed that defoliation reduced significantly the total number of male flowers produced in two of the sites. Defoliation did not impact female flower production or the proportion of female flowers produced. Finally, floral visit rates were not affected by defoliation via changes in sexual expression and neither by site or by the interaction site x defoliation. Findings showed that defoliation had an effect on sex expression in C. aconitifolius, although apparently this change did not affect the plant-pollinator interactions.

AB We examined frugivore visitation and seed dispersal of five large-seeded (>= 5 mm) tree species in tropical montane forest based on their occurrence in frugivorous primate diets: Ekebergia capensis, Olea capensis, Parinari excelsa, Prunus africana, and Syzygium guineense. A total of 21 frugivores in five assemblages (i.e., chimpanzees, cercopithecines, large-bodied birds, small-bodied birds, and squirrels) were observed over the study period (August 2006 and October-April 2007). We observed seed dispersal in four of five tree species studied; no dispersal was observed for P. excelsa. Frugivore assemblages did not visit tree species equally. Primates spent the most time in trees and had the largest group size. Large-bodied birds (LB) and chimpanzees dispersed the highest number of seeds per minute. LB and cercopithecines potentially dispersed the greatest number of seeds for E. capensis, and chimpanzees for S. guineense. Our analyses indicated that the mean fruiting duration of the focal tree, time in the tree, and number of species present are important predictor variables for seed dispersal by small- and large-bodied birds, and cercopithecines. The number of fruiting trees in the immediate vicinity of the focal tree further predicted seed dispersal for small-bodied birds (SB). Large-bodied birdseed dispersal also was predicted by time in tree by SB, and the number of individuals for SB and cercopithecines. Cercopithecines (CS) were further explained by the time in tree and number of species (SB & LB), and number of individuals for CS. Our study highlights the complexity of describing the relative importance of a frugivore assemblage to the dispersal of a tree species seeds.

AB In the tropical forests of SE Asia, only a few studies have dealt with the role animal dispersal plays in early forest succession and rehabilitation, and a comparison of bird and bat dispersal is even rarer. We investigated seed dispersal by birds and bats in a successional area in the lowland dipterocarp forest of the Subic Watershed Forest Reserve (SWFR) in Luzon Island, Philippines. Using pairs of day and night traps, we collected seeds during 3 mo of wet season and 3 mo of dry season in a 1.2-ha study site. Bird-dispersed seeds predominated over those dispersed by bats in terms of both seed abundance and number of seed species. The most abundant endozoochorous seed species were significantly biased toward either bird or bat dispersal. Birds and bats appeared to compete more strongly for fruit resources during the dry season than during the wet season, and bats responded more to changes in the seasons than birds did. GLM analyses showed that the factor that had the strongest influence on overall seed distribution was the number of fleshy-fruited trees surrounding the traps, and that the distribution pattern of day-dispersed seeds was affected by more physical factors (number of trees, size of trees, presence of fleshy-fruited and conspecific trees) in the study site than the pattern of night-dispersed seeds were. Given that birds are the more important dispersers in the study site, restoration efforts in SWFR might benefit by focusing on attracting these dispersers into its degraded habitats.

AB The abundance of large vertebrates is rapidly declining, particularly in the tropics where over-hunting has left many forests structurally intact but devoid of large animals. An urgent question then, is whether these 'empty' forests can sustain their biodiversity without large vertebrates. Here we examine the role of forest elephant (Loxodonta africana cyclotis) seed dispersal in maintaining the community structure of trees in the Ndoki Forest, northern Congo. Analysis of 855 elephant dung piles suggested that forest elephants disperse more intact seeds than any other species or genus of large vertebrate in African forests, while GPS telemetry data showed that forest elephants regularly disperse seeds over unprecedented distances compared to other dispersers. Our analysis of the spatial distribution of trees from a sample of 5667 individuals showed that dispersal mechanism was tightly correlated with the scale of spatial aggregation. Increasing amounts of elephant seed dispersal was associated with decreasing aggregation. At distances of < 200 m, trees whose seeds are dispersed only by elephants were less aggregated than the random expectation, suggesting Janzen-Connell effects on seed/seedling mortality. At the landscape scale, seed dispersal mode predicted the rate at which local tree community similarity decayed in space. Our results suggest that the loss of forest elephants (and other large-bodied dispersers) may lead to a wave of recruitment failure among animal-dispersed tree species, and favor regeneration of the species-poor abiotically dispersed guild of trees.

AB Tropical stream ecosystems in montane forest watersheds are important centers of endemism and diversity and provide essential ecosystem services. These habitats are subject to a variety of stressors, including the conversion of adjacent terrestrial habitats from forest to agriculture, but the impacts of these anthropogenic effects are largely unknown because of the paucity of studies in these systems. In montane habitats in the wet tropics, large-scale cultivation of tea is common and can represent an important source of income at local and national scales. However, little is known about how tea cultivation impacts adjacent stream ecosystems. In this study, we examine stream macroinvertebrate assemblages in a biodiversity hotspot the East Usambara Mountains, Tanzania. Specifically, we compare diversity of macroinvertebrate assemblages found on cobbles in stream riffles in watersheds dominated by forest with those surrounded by tea cultivation. We found that streams surrounded by tea were characterized by significantly lower dissolved oxygen and had lower total estimated species richness and number of families. Furthermore, the richness of invertebrate taxa known to be sensitive to anthropogenic disturbance were substantially reduced in tea streams and general assemblage-level analysis shows significant differences in the composition of macroinvertebrate assemblages between tea and forested streams. Our results suggest that tea cultivation may reduce stream habitat quality and biodiversity in the East Usambaras. Further research is needed to evaluate the effects of tea cultivation on streams over longer times scales and to address methods for minimizing negative effects of agriculture on montane stream communities.

AB Very little is known about the diversity of arthropods in the fast-disappearing fragments of natural forests in sub-Saharan Africa. This study investigated: (1) the influence of forest fragment characteristics on dung beetle species richness, composition, abundance, and diversity; and (2) the relationship between dung beetle assemblages and rainfall pattern. Beetles were sampled through 12 mo using dung baited pitfall traps. A total of 18,073 dung beetles belonging to three subfamilies and 45 species were captured. The subfamily Scarabaeinae was the most abundant (99%) and species rich (89%). Fast-burying tunnellers (paracoprids) were the most dominant functional group. Catharsius sesostris, Copris nepos, and Heliocopris punctiventris were the three most abundant species, and had the highest contributions to dissimilarities between forests. With few exceptions, dung beetle abundance, species richness, and diversity were generally higher in larger forest fragments (100-150 ha) than in smaller ones (10-50 ha) and the nature reserve (1042 ha). Forest fragment size had a highly significant positive relationship with beetle abundance, but only when the nature reserve is excluded in the analysis. Dung beetle abundance and species richness showed direct weak relationships with litter depth (positive) and groundcover (negative) but not tree density, tree species richness, and fragment isolation distance. Dung beetle abundance and species richness were strongly correlated with monthly changes in rainfall. Results of this study indicate that forest fragments on agricultural lands in the Budongo landscape, especially medium-sized (100-150 ha) ones, represent important conservation areas for dung beetles.

AB Land conversion for agriculture is an increasing threat to biodiversity conservation, but its ecological effects on African birds is practically unknown. We investigated the impacts of agriculture on the diet and productivity of a small, disjunct population of Mackinder's eagle owls (Bubo capensis mackinderi ) in central Kenya. Owl diet was determined by analysis of pellets and other remains and compared to small mammal populations estimated by live trapping in two habitats. Small mammal abundance was low and averaged 7.4 small mammals/ha in farms and 0.5 small mammals/ha in grassland. Owls consumed a wide diversity of prey. The majority were mammals (87%) followed by birds (7%) and insects (5%). The percentage of small mammals in owl diet correlated positively with the relative abundance of small mammals during monthly trapping sessions. Diet composition did not influence owl breeding success. Farming activities affected owl diet composition through crop production. The amount of maize, peas, and carrots growing in farms was correlated with the abundance of Mastomys sp. and Procavia sp. in the owl's diet. Agricultural activities had a large effect on Mackinder's eagle owl diet by increasing the abundance of certain small-mammal prey and attracting owl prey to farms, though farming practices harmful to owls were observed.

AB Small mammals were trapped annually in two savanna and two forest plots in cerrado habitats of Noel Kempff Mercado National Park, Santa Cruz, Bolivia, for 5-10 yr. Eighteen species were captured in forest and seven species in savanna. Species numbers and total number of individuals captured were tightly correlated. In forest, species and abundance varied interannually by up to fourfold in one plot and to 100-fold in the other, and showed alternating highs and lows as is typical for small mammals. The largest faunal differences were due not to site differences, but to year differences, with markedly different patterns in forests and savannas. Abundance was not correlated with rainfall overall, but showed correlation in exceptional years of rainfall and ENSO drought. In savanna, species and overall abundance declined without recovery during 3 yr after reaching minimum numbers in 2004. One species, Cavia aperea, became extinct on both plots, and subsequently, apparently on the entire savanna. Both herbivorous and insectivorous species declined together. Rainfall, fire, and flooding do not seem to account for savanna rodent declines. I propose the novel hypothesis that smoke from anthropogenic burning raises nocturnal temperatures and prevents dew formation, and that a decrease in nightly dry season dewfall has been instrumental in rodent declines. Anecdotal and climatic data are consistent with this hypothesis, but it cannot yet be tested.

AB Although members of the family Hylobatidae are known to be monogamous, adult white-handed gibbons (Hylobates lar) at Khao Yai National Park, Thailand, also show multimale groups and polyandry. A need for more than one male to successfully raise offspring cannot explain the occurrence of polyandry in these territorial primates, because direct paternal care is absent in this species. We hypothesize that polyandry is primarily related to costs/benefits for males of cooperatively defending a female and/or resources; our prediction was that polyandry would become more frequent with increasing costs of female/resource defense. We measured the ecological quality of seven gibbon home ranges over a 3-yr period (2001-2003) to investigate how resource availability affected the probability of polyandry, and found a significant negative relationship between home range quality and home range size. Larger home ranges were of lower quality. As predicted, groups living on larger, poorer home ranges also experienced longer periods of polyandry. In forest areas of comparatively low quality, acquiring and maintaining a large home range that includes enough resources for a female to reproduce steadily may surpass a single male's capacity. Our model of cooperative male polyandry was supported by preliminary data of shared territorial defense and access to the female. However, interaction proportions were strongly skewed, and female's primary male partners monopolized grooming and mating. Nevertheless, a primary male on a large territory may benefit from the presence of a secondary male with aid in territorial/female defense, whereas a secondary male may gain by avoiding high dispersal costs.

AB We combined phylogenetic and biogeographic data to examine the mode of speciation in a group of African monkeys, the Cercopithecini. If allopatric speciation is the major force producing species, then there should be a positive relationship between the relative divergence time of taxa and their degree of geographic range overlap. Alternatively, an opposite relationship between divergence time and geographic range overlap is consistent with sympatric speciation as the main mechanism underlying the cercopithecin radiation. We collected biogeographic and phylogenetic data for 19 guenon species from the literature. We digitized geographic range maps and utilized three different phylogenetic hypotheses based on Y chromosome, X chromosome, and mitochondrial (mtDNA) data. We used regressions with Monte Carlo simulation to examine the relationship between the relative time since divergence of taxa and their degree of geographic range overlap. We found that there was a positive relationship between relative divergence time and the proportion of geographic range overlap between taxa using all three molecular data sets. Our findings provide evidence for allopatric speciation being the common mode of diversification in the cercopithecin clade. Because most of these primates are forest adapted mammals, the cyclical contraction and expansion of African forests from the late Miocene to the present has likely been an important factor driving allopatric speciation. In addition, geographic barriers such as the Congo and Sanaga rivers have probably played a complementary role in producing new species within the clade.

AB To assess the contributions of rustic shade cacao plantations to vascular epiphyte conservation, we compared epiphyte species richness, abundance, composition, and vertical distributions on shade trees and in the understories of six plantations and adjacent natural forests. On three phorophytes and three 10 x 10 m understory plots in each of the agroforestry plantations and natural forests, 54 and 77 species were observed, respectively. Individual-based rarefaction curves revealed that epiphyte species richness was significantly higher on forest phorophytes than on cacao farm shade trees; detailed analyses showed that the differences were confined to the inner and outer crown zones of the phorophytes. No differences in epiphyte species richness were found in understories. Araceae, Piperaceae, and Pteridophyta were less species-rich in plantations than in forests, while there were no differences in Orchidaceae and Bromeliaceae. Regression analysis revealed that epiphyte species richness on trunks varied with canopy cover, while abundance was more closely related to soil pH, canopy cover, and phorophyte height. For crown epiphytes, phorophyte diameter at breast height (dbh) explained much of the variation in species richness and abundance. There were also pronounced downward shifts in the vertical distributions of epiphyte species in agroforests relative to natural forests. The results confirm that epiphyte diversity, composition, and vertical distributions are useful indicators of human disturbance and showed that while the studied plantations serve to preserve portions of epiphyte diversity in the landscape, their presence does not fully compensate for the loss of forests.

Based on the stable carbon isotope ratio of the animals' breath (delta(13)C(breath)), it was possible to distinguish between the isotopically distinct food chains of fruit-eating bats and blood-eating vampire bats. Portable instruments for the analysis of delta(13)C(breath) may improve our ability to quantify animal diets, because they are accurate and cheap, and most importantly they can be used in situ.

AB Primates are an extraordinarily well-known tropical forest, mammalian taxon. We investigated potential modes of niche separation in primates by identifying sympatric species with putatively similar niche characteristics and assessing potential competition using data gleaned from an extensive literature review. We defined competing species-pairs as (a) sympatric species in which (b) the body mass of the larger species was within 30 percent of the smaller species' mass and (c) the species had the same category of diet. A sample of 43 well-studied forests (7-20 per continent) provided 673 pairs of sympatric primate species. Of these, 45 pairs (7%) are potential competitors by our definition. Africa has the largest number of competing pairs (17 pairs), while Asia might have the highest percentage of competitors in each forest site (17%). Niche separation was investigated for each pair by examining them for each of eight possible modes of separation: detailed differences in diets (28% of potential competitors), use of different heights in the forest (25%), use of different types of forest (14%), use of different locations within the forest (11%), use of support branches of different diameters (7%), different ranging behavior (6%), different techniques of prey capture (4%), and differential timing of activity (4%). The use of different heights in the forest is the dominant form of potential separation in Africa (31% of competing species-pairs) and Asia (38%), while detailed differences in diet appears to be the primary mode of niche separation in the Americas (26%) and Madagascar (32%).

AB Leaf chemical, biophysical, and optical properties were measured in 13 populations of Metrosideros polymorpha across gradients of soil fertility and climate in Hawaii. Climate (predominantly temperature) caused large changes in specific leaf area (SLA) and SLA-linked traits, including nitrogen (N) and pigment contents, as did conditions of highest soil fertility on 20 ky old substrates. When averaged by site, chemical constituent ratios containing chlorophyll (Car/Chl, Chl/N) varied more across climate than substrate gradients, while the Chl a/b ratio was similarly influenced by climate and substrate. Variations in Chl a/b ratios and SLA were similar to those found previously in a common garden of M. polymorpha taken from our climate gradient, suggesting strong genetic control over these traits. Optical reflectance indices related to photosynthetic function were closely correlated to pigment changes, varying three times more in response to climate than across substrate ages. Combined, our results suggest that variation in leaf structure, composition, and function of M. polymorpha is a result of genetic and phenotypic adaptation to environmental differences, and that these variations are greater in response to climate (especially temperature) than to soil fertility.

AB Mature tropical forests are disappearing and secondary forests are becoming more abundant, thus there is an increasing need to understand the ecology and management of secondary forests. In the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico, seasonally dry tropical forests are subject to frequent fire, and early-successional stands are extremely dense. We applied vegetation thinning (removal of all stems < 2 cm in diameter) to hasten secondary succession and open the understory to reduce the fire ladder in an 11-yr-old stand. We quantified the effect of vegetation thinning on above- and belowground carbon over 5 yr. Aboveground carbon included all standing vegetation and belowground carbon included fine roots and organic carbon in the Oi, Oe, and Oa soil horizons. Trees with diameter of 2-10 cm and > 10 cm had higher carbon accumulation rates in thinned plots than in control plots. Carbon stored in the Oi-horizon and the Oe > 2 mm fraction remained significantly higher in thinned plots even 5 yr after treatment. Carbon in fine roots was significantly higher in thinned plots, and radiocarbon ((14)C) data suggest that fine roots in thinned plots were recently produced in comparison with fine roots in control plots. We did not find significant differences in total ecosystem carbon after 5 yr (126 +/- 6 and 136 +/- 8 Mg C/ha, respectively). These results suggest rapid carbon recovery and support the hypothesis that young tropical forests thinned to hasten succession and reduce the fire hazard may have only a short-term negative impact on carbon accumulation in vegetation and soils.

AB In a Panamanian lower montane rain forest we: (1) analyzed the vertical and horizontal distribution of fine roots; and (2) assessed the relationship of fine root mass to thickness of the soil organic layer, soil pH, and soil-extractable nitrogen. The soil in the study area has developed on volcanic ash deposits and was classified as Hapludand. In randomly distributed samples, the median fine root mass (biomass and necromass, diam <= 2 mm) to a depth of 100 cm mineral soil was 544 g/m(2), 41 percent of which was found in the organic layer. Fine root mass was approximately twice as high in the vicinity of stems of the tree species Oreomunnea mexicana (1069 g/m(2)) and the palm species Colpothrinax aphanopetala (1169 g/m(2)) and was associated with thick organic layers. The median thickness of the soil organic layer in a larger random sample (N = 64) was 8 cm with a considerable variation (interquartile range: 7 cm). In these samples, the density of fine root biomass was correlated with the concentration of extractable nitrogen (r = 0.33, P = 0.011), and on an areal basis, fine root biomass in the organic layer increased with increasing thickness of the organic layer (r = 0.63, P < 0.001) and decreasing pH(KCl) (r = -0.33, P < 0.01). Fine root biomass in the upper mineral soil did not show significant correlations with any of the studied parameters.

AB Variation in postdispersal seed fate is an important factor driving patterns of forest regeneration. Because most previous studies have not tracked final seed fate and have commonly equated seed removal with predation without considering the possibility of secondary dispersal, little is known about individual seed mortality factors in successional and degraded habitats. This study tracked the postdispersal fate of large-seeded tropical montane trees in abandoned pasture, young secondary forests, and small forest fragments during two consecutive years in an agricultural landscape in southern Costa Rica. The incidence of secondary dispersal by animals, scatterhoarding in particular, and the effects of seed burial on germination were measured. Overall, seeds survived through germination more often in secondary forests with high levels of mortality occurring in abandoned pastures and forest fragments. The majority of seed mortality was caused by rodent predation in forest fragments, insects and fungal pathogens in secondary forests, and a combination of desiccation, insects, and fungal pathogens in pastures. Seeds were frequently secondarily dispersed in larger forest fragments, whereas they were only rarely moved in pastures and secondary forests. Burial tended to improve germination in pastures and was important for an often scatterhoarded species, Otoba novogranatensis, in all habitats. The results of this study suggest that: (1) seed mortality factors differ in response to the type of habitat degradation; (2) large-seeded species have high potential for survival when dispersed to young secondary forests; and (3) seed removal is not a reliable proxy for seed predation, particularly in less degraded forest fragments.

AB One of the least understood aspects of insect diversity in tropical rain forests is the temporal structuring, or seasonality, of communities. We collected 29,986 beetles of 1473 species over a 4-yr period (45 monthly samples), with the aim to document the temporal dynamics of a trophically diverse beetle assemblage from lowland tropical rain forest at Cape Tribulation, Australia. Malaise and flight interception traps were used to sample adult beetles at five locations at both ground and canopy levels. Beetles were caught throughout the year, but individual species were patchy in their temporal distribution, with the 124 more abundant species on average being present only 56 percent of the time. Climatic variables (precipitation, temperature, and solar radiation) were poorly correlated with adult beetle abundance, possibly because: (1) seasonality of total beetle abundance was slight; (2) the peak activity period (September-November) did not correspond to any climatic maxima or minima; or (3) responses were nonlinear owing to the existence of thresholds or developmental time-lags. Our results do not concur with the majority of tropical insect seasonality studies suggesting a wet season peak of insect activity, perhaps because there is no uniform pattern of insect seasonally for the humid tropics. Herbivores showed low seasonality and individual species' peaks were less temporally aggregated compared to nonherbivores. Canopy-caught and larger beetles (> 5 mm) showed greater seasonality and peaked later in the year compared to smaller or ground-caught beetles. Thus seasonality of adult beetles varied according to the traits of feeding ecology, body size, and habitat strata.

AB We used a standard sampling protocol to measure elevational patterns of species richness and abundance of eusocial paper wasps (Hymenoptera: Vespidae) in Costa Rica. The sample transect of six sites spanned approximately 2000 m in elevation from lowland to montane forest. Species accumulation curves and species richness estimates both document a low elevation peak in paper wasp species richness at 50 and 300 m asl, with a decline in species richness at higher elevations. Comparison of species composition among elevations revealed strong species turnover from a rich lowland fauna to a depauperate, but distinct, montane fauna. We also observed a general trend toward a greater abundance of paper wasps at higher elevations, a pattern not usually observed in eusocial insects. Army ant species that prey on paper wasps declined in abundance with elevation across the sample transect, a pattern that has been observed at other sites. We discuss the possibility that elevational changes in predation pressure affect variation in paper wasp abundance and species richness. Eusocial paper wasp species employ one of two modes of colony founding, independent and swarm founding. We found that the total abundance of individual swarm-founding wasps was higher at all elevations than the abundance of independent-founding wasps, supporting previous suggestions that Neotropical swarm founders are more successful ecologically.

AB Dry season den use by the pygmy spotted skunk Spilogale pygmaea, an endemic and threatened species of western Mexico, was evaluated at the micro and macrohabitat level, in the tropical deciduous forest of Chamela, Jalisco, Mexico. During the dry seasons of 1997, 1998, and 2000, 79 skunk den sites (29 for females and 50 males) were located using Radiotelemetry. Dens were underground excavations with one to five access points, located mostly on open ground or under live or dead trees. Skunks exhibited a continued reuse of dens but evidence of simultaneous occupation by two or more skunks was not found. Microhabitat den-site analysis showed that skunks showed flexibility and individual variation in usage of the microhabitat surrounding den sites inside the forest. Macrohabitat den-site analysis showed that skunks were not selecting either tropical deciduous or tropical semideciduous forest; however, no dens were located outside the forest in transformed habitats, strengthening the hypothesis of the association of this species with the tropical deciduous forests on the Pacific coast of Mexico. The current deforestation rates of the tropical deciduous forest in the coast of Jalisco could be reducing the potential den sites for pygmy spotted skunks and exposing them to adverse environmental conditions and predation.

AB Development of sustainable forestry has been hampered in tropical countries by a scarcity of research on the ecological effects of logging. We focused on cavity-nesting birds, a group known to be sensitive to logging. Cavities used for nesting were not a random subset of all available suitable cavities. Birds selected cavities that were relatively high above the ground, had smaller entrances, and were excavated by woodpeckers. The use of tree species was also not random: Calycophyllum multiflorum, Blepharocalyx gigantea, and Podocarpus parlatorei were disproportionately important. Cavity nests were also more likely to be found in areas with trees with high mean diameter at breast height. This study emphasizes the need to maintain some unlogged forest patches within logging areas and retain certain species of trees. This study has implications for forest management in Argentina, where a new law mandates the sustainable use of forest resources and where many landowners are interested in forest certification.

AB Parrot populations are being increasingly pressured to occupy modified or fragmented landscapes, yet little is known of the habitat requirements of most species, particularly with regard to the effects on breeding habitat. We evaluated nesting habitat of the lilac-crowned parrot Amazona finschi in the modified landscape of coastal Michoacan in Mexico. We located 90 parrot nests in 12 tree species in Michoacan, with lilac-crowned parrots presenting a narrow niche-breadth of tree species used for nesting. Considering an additional 82 nest trees recorded for lilac-crowned parrots in Jalisco, we determined a 51 percent similarity in cavity resource use by parrots in the two dry forest regions. Overall, the predominant nest tree species with 76 percent of nests were Astronium graveolens, Piranhea mexicana, Brosimum alicastrum, and Tabebuia spp., all characteristic of semi-deciduous forest. Only 8 percent of nests occurred in trees characteristic of deciduous forest. Parrots utilized large trees with canopy level cavities as nest sites, and preferred conserved semi-deciduous forest for nesting, with fewer nests than expected in deciduous forest and transformed agricultural land. Nest areas in semi-deciduous forest occurred on significantly steeper terrain, as remnant semi-deciduous forest is restricted to steep ridges and canyons. Those parrot nests in modified habitats and forest patches were located near to continuous forest, with nest trees in open agricultural land being significantly closer to continuous forest than nests in disturbed forest patches. These results demonstrate the importance of conserved semi-deciduous forest as breeding habitat for the threatened, endemic lilac-crowned parrot, making wild populations of the species vulnerable to the high rate of transformation and fragmentation of tropical dry forest.

AB Reduced-impact logging (RIL) represents a viable option for sustainable use of Neotropical lowland forests while minimizing negative effects on local biodiversity. Many Neotropical bats of the family Phyllostomidae provide ecosystem services associated with pollination and seed dispersal that promote the regeneration of disturbed areas; therefore, effects of RIL on these species is of particular concern. We determined patterns of temporal activity, degree of temporal overlap of activity, and dispersion in peaks of activity for seven abundant species of frugivorous bat in Tapajos National Forest, Para, Brazil. In addition, we evaluated the effects of RIL at a harvest level of 18.7 m(3)/ha and habitat physiognomy on temporal patterns of activity for these species. Bats were surveyed for four nights at each of 96 sites for a total sampling effort of 64,512 net-m-h. Sites were distributed among four experimental blocks, two blocks of unlogged forest and two blocks of forest subjected to RIL. Half of the sites in each management type were in forest gaps and half were in closed-canopy forest. In general, species exhibited similar patterns of activity, and greater than expected temporal overlap in activity among species. RIL and forest physiognomy had little effect on activity patterns of species. RIL in Amazonia removes fewer trees than do naturally occurring treefalls and such changes in habitat structure do not alter activity patterns of frugivorous bats. Evidence suggests that RIL does not have an appreciable adverse effect on frugivorous bats in Amazonia.

AB Quantifying forest change in the tropics is important because of the role these forests play in the conservation of biodiversity and the global carbon cycle. One of the world's largest remaining areas of tropical forest is located in Papua New Guinea. Here we show that change in its extent and condition has occurred to a greater extent than previously recorded. We assessed deforestation and forest degradation in Papua New Guinea by comparing a land-cover map from 1972 with a land-cover map created from nationwide high-resolution satellite imagery recorded since 2002. In 2002 there were 28,251,967 ha of tropical rain forest. Between 1972 and 2002, a net 15 percent of Papua New Guinea's tropical forests were cleared and 8.8 percent were degraded through logging. The drivers of forest change have been concentrated within the accessible forest estate where a net 36 percent were degraded or deforested through both forestry and nonforestry processes. Since 1972, 13 percent of upper montane forests have also been lost. We estimate that over the period 1990-2002, overall rates of change generally increased and varied between 0.8 and 1.8 percent/yr, while rates in commercially accessible forest have been far higher-having varied between 1.1 and 3.4 percent/yr. These rates are far higher than those reported by the FAO over the same period. We conclude that rapid and substantial forest change has occurred in Papua New Guinea, with the major drivers being logging in the lowland forests and subsistence agriculture throughout the country with comparatively minor contributions from forest fires, plantation establishment, and mining.

AB Macadamia tetraphylla is a subtropical rain forest tree from fragmented lowlands in eastern Australia. Owing to habitat loss and fragmentation, this commercially important species is vulnerable to extinction. Breeding system and fecundity were investigated in nine populations incorporating three habitat types (moderately disturbed, highly disturbed, and intact) to determine if seed set, seed weight, and genetic diversity are compromised by disturbance. Breeding success was also tested using pollen donors from distant (30-100 km), local (2-3 km), neighbor (10-20 m), and near-neighbor (< 10 m) sources. Macadamia tetraphylla is weakly self-compatible but incapable of automatic self-pollination. Across populations, seed to flower ratios were always < 0.1 percent in open-pollinated trees and trees from moderately disturbed habitats had the highest fruit production. Outcross pollen produced more seed per raceme than open-pollinated or self-pollination treatments. Seed set and seed weights were positively influenced by pollen source with local pollen and distant pollen effecting more or heavier seeds. Germination rates and genetic diversity did not vary significantly in seedlings from different pollen sources. Results suggest a pollen source from at least a 2 km distance is an optimal outbreeding distance; however, many wild populations do not have conspecifics at optimal distances owing to habitat fragmentation. Highly disturbed populations are producing seed but the longevity of these sites is threatened by weed invasions. We conclude that small populations in degraded habitats that are at risk of being overlooked should not be ignored but should be a focus for restoration efforts as they are a valuable asset for the conservation of M. tetraphylla.

AB To truly understand the current status of tropical diversity and to forecast future trends, we need to increase emphasis on the study of biodiversity in rural landscapes that are actively managed or modified by people. We present an integrated landscape approach to promote research in human-modified landscapes that includes the effects of landscape structure and dynamics on conservation of biodiversity, provision of ecosystem services, and sustainability of rural livelihoods. We propose research priorities encompassing three major areas: biodiversity, human-environment interactions, and restoration ecology. We highlight key areas where we lack knowledge and where additional understanding is most urgent for promoting conservation and sustaining rural livelihoods. Finally, we recommend participatory and multidisciplinary approaches in research and management. Lasting conservation efforts demand new alliances among conservation biologists, agroecologists, agronomists, farmers, indigenous peoples, rural social movements, foresters, social scientists, and land managers to collaborate in research, co-design conservation programs and policies, and manage human-modified landscapes in ways that enhance biodiversity conservation and promote sustainable livelihoods.

AB We evaluated differences in the rates and correlates of decomposition among 32 fern and angiosperm litter types collected in Hawai'i. Leptosporangiate ferns were separated into groups based on phylogeny: 'polypod' ferns, a monophyletic clade of ferns that diversified in the Cretaceous, and all other ('non-polypod') ferns that diversified earlier. We measured initial litter chemistry (nutrients and carbon chemistry), and mass loss and nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and calcium (Ca) of litter tissue during a 1-yr incubation in a common garden. Nutrient concentrations and carbon (C) chemistry differed significantly among litter types, and litter turnover (k-values) ranged from 0.29 to 8.31. Decomposition rates were more closely correlated with nutrient concentration than is typically observed. Lignin:N was the best predictor of decomposition across all litter types combined; however, among plant groups different predictors of decomposition were important. Nitrogen and P concentrations best predicted fern decomposition, whereas C chemistry, particularly lignin concentration, was more important for angiosperm (monocot and dicot) decomposition. Among native plants, non-polypod ferns decomposed significantly more slowly than both polypod ferns and angiosperms. Contrary to our hypothesis, fern litter did not decompose more slowly than angiosperm litter overall. Nutrient dynamics in litter were affected by initial litter concentration more than phylogeny; low-nutrient litter immobilized more nutrients than high-nutrient litter. Systematic differences in rates of decomposition, and the importance of nutrients in predicting fern decomposition, imply that changes in species composition within ferns and between ferns and angiosperms could influence the functioning of ecosystems where ferns are important forest components.

AB Oceanic islands are good model systems with which to explore factors affecting exotic species diversity. Islands vary in size, topography, substrate type, degree of isolation, native species diversity, history, human population characteristics, and economic development. Moreover, islands are highly vulnerable to exotic species establishment. We used AICc analyses of data on 1132 vascular plant species for 15 countries and 114 islands from the Pacific Island Ecosystems at Risk (PIER) project to examine biological, geographical, and socioeconomic correlates of exotic species richness. PIER provides data on the distribution of naturalized non-native plant species thought to pose environmental or economic risk. We hypothesized that the numbers of PIER-listed species would be positively correlated with island size, habitat diversity, and proximity to major source pools for propagules. Further, we expected numbers of PIER-listed exotic species to be similar among islands in the same country and to be greater where human populations were larger and where economic activity was high. Most species (908) were found on <= 10 islands. Species number was significantly correlated with island and country areas and with native plant species richness. The strongest model revealed by AICc analyses of island data included log (area) and maximum elevation as well as country membership, substrate type, and presence of an airport with paved runway (an index of economic activity). By country, AICc analyses revealed two equivalent models, both of which included log (area) and per capita gross domestic product as well as a measure of population size (either log (population size) or (population density)). Our analyses provide strong evidence of the roles of biogeographic, environmental, and socioeconomic impacts on the distribution and spread of exotic species.

AB Current understanding of the vulnerability of tropical forests to plant invasion is limited but is widely believed to increase where forests: (1) suffer marked natural or man-made disturbance; and/or (2) are exposed to high propagule pressure of alien species. This study aimed, for the first time, to address the importance of propagule pressure and disturbance by examining the spread of an introduced tree, Cordia alliodora, from a single plantation into a surrounding mosaic of humid forest in the East Usambara Mountains, Tanzania. By assessing vulnerability to invasion along transects radiating from the plantation, the effects of distance (measure of propagule pressure), and disturbance could be discerned. For all life stages, distance from source population was the strongest correlate of density. A marked influence of disturbance was only evident for C. alliodora seedlings. Spatial variation in the densities of later life stages may be a function of past disturbances, less easy to assess from current surveys, especially following the marked self-thinning between seedling and adult densities. Nevertheless, the evidence suggests that propagule pressure is a more important determinant of Cordia density than disturbance. If this is true for other alien tree species in tropical forests, controlling for introduction effort is essential to assess the drivers of plant invasion. Given an annual population growth rate of ca 3.5 percent, equivalent to the population doubling every 20 yr, C. alliodora poses a significant threat to the East Usambaras as well as other humid forests where it is promoted for agroforestry.

AB Information concerning the fruit production of timber species is important for the assessment of the effects of logging practices and for the improvement of harvesting techniques. We assessed the effects of stem diameter, crown illumination, and liana load on Chrysophyllum lucentifolium subsp. pachycarpum fruiting over a 3-yr period in areas subjected to conventional and reduced impact logging 10-13 yr prior to the study and within a control area, in the eastern Brazilian Amazon. We further used this data set to estimate the proportion of fertile trees harvested following the adoption of 90 percent harvesting intensity and two different minimum diameter cutting limits (MDCL). Liana presence on > 50 percent of the crown was associated with a decrease in the odds of fruiting. Therefore, liana cutting aiming to increase fruiting output should target only trees in such a condition. We found no significant effects of logging treatments and crown illumination on the odds of fruiting. The percentage of reproductive trees, frequency, and intensity of fruiting increased markedly for trees > 40 cm dbh. The proportion of fertile trees harvested following the adoption of 50 cm dbh MDCL is relatively low (13-15%) and therefore, this practice is likely to have a low direct impact on C. lucentifolium fruiting at the population level. However, even for a population with relatively small fertile individuals and low proportion of trees >= 50 cm dbh, the MDCL should not be < 50 cm dbh, unless a lower harvest intensity is adopted.

AB Studies of tropical secondary forest succession face strong limitations due to the slow pace of succession and the time-consuming task of monitoring processes. The occurrence of tree rings in secondary forest trees may help expand our knowledge on succession in these systems and may be useful for fallow dating in chronosequence studies. We examine here the potential of tree rings to study forest succession by sampling 70 species along chronosequences of dry and wet forests in southern Mexico. Based on wood anatomical features, we estimated that about 37 percent of the species presented distinct growth rings useful for ring studies. Overall, maximum number of rings matched well the interview-based fallow ages but, at some sites, trees had consistently higher numbers of rings, probably due to errors in fallow ages derived from interviews. Best fallow age estimations were obtained by examining rings in both pioneer and nonpioneer species. Reconstruction of species' establishment dates revealed that pioneer and nonpioneer species establish early during succession, and that species of both groups continue to recruit after many years. Our study clearly shows that tree ring analysis is a promising tool for studies on secondary forest succession in the tropics.

AB Spiders that are abundant along streams may depend on energy subsidies across land-water ecotones, but the effects of season and habitat structure on this trophic linkage remain poorly understood in the tropics. We carried out surveys and a manipulative experiment to investigate the effects of season and substrate availability on the distribution of riparian orb-web spiders in Hong Kong, southern China. In the surveys, spider abundance, prey, substrate use, and web orientation were recorded. The experiment involved installation of in-stream artificial substrates (ropes and bamboo poles) to increase substrate availability for web attachment. We found no seasonal difference in web abundance, but seasonal differences were observed for the prey on webs: aquatic insects (mostly Ephemeroptera and chironomid midges) contributed 69 percent of total prey collected during the wet season, but only 38 percent during the dry season. Most webs (50-80%) were < 0.5 m above the water and 45-51 percent of them tended to be orientated horizontally to the water surface and supported by overhanging vegetation and boulders. The addition of artificial substrates resulted in a 23-34 percent increase in the number of webs at the four treatment sites compared to controls, indicating that availability of web-building substrates is a critical determinant of the spider distribution. Our results suggest that riparian zones are potential 'hotspots' of food availability for spiders, and that the aquatic insect subsidy allows this habitat to support increased densities of spiders when the constraint of substrate availability is relaxed.

AB In Mauritius, the endemic blue-tailed day-gecko Phelsuma cepediana is currently the sole pollinator and seed disperser of the critically endangered endemic plant Roussea simplex (Rousseaceae). The flowers and fruits are often visited by the invasive ant Technomyrmex albipes, which forages on the nectar and fruit pulp, and tends honeydew-producing mealybugs on the fruits. Here, we experimentally explore how the presence of this alien ant species influences geckos foraging at flowers and fruits of R. simplex by removing and excluding ants from flowers and fruits. Gecko visitation rates to ant-free control flowers and fruits, and flowers and fruits where ants had been removed and excluded, were higher than those to ant-infested flowers and fruits. The resulting seed set of ant-infested flowers was greatly reduced, compared to ant-free control flowers. Similarly, for fruits with ants, very few seeds were likely to be ingested and dispersed by the geckos. Thus, T. albipes monopolizes flowers and fruits of R. simplex, and prevents access of pollinating and seed-dispersing P. cepediana geckos by aggressive interference competition. For a critically endangered plant like R. simplex, this double-disruption of two vital mutualistic interactions is of urgent conservation concern.

AB Plants frequently display fruit characteristics that support multiple seed-dispersal syndromes. These ambiguous characteristics may reflect the fact that seed dispersal is usually a complex process involving multiple dispersers. This is the case for the Neotropical ginger Renealmia alpinia (Zingiberaceae). It was originally suggested that the aromatic fruits of R. alpinia located at the base of the plant are adapted for terrestrial mammal seed dispersal. However, the dark-purple coloration of the fruits and bright orange aril surrounding the seeds suggest that birds may play a role in R. alpinia seed dispersal. At La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica, we used camera traps to record vertebrate visits to infructescences of R. alpinia. Most visitors were toucans and aracaris (Ramphastidae). However fruits were also removed by terrestrial mammals (coatis and armadillos). In addition to vertebrate fruit removal, some of the fruits dehisce and the seeds that fall on the ground are dispersed by ants. Fruitfall traps showed that 77 percent of fruits are removed by vertebrates. However, 15 percent of fruits fall to the base of parent plants to be potentially dispersed by ants. Experiments using a laboratory ant colony showed that ants are effective seed dispersers of R. alpinia. Ant seed manipulation increased germination success and reduced time to germination. In conclusion, primary seed dispersal in the Neotropical ginger R. alpinia is mostly performed by birds, additionally ants are effective dispersers at short distances. Seed dispersal in R. alpinia is a complex process involving a diverse array of dispersal agents.

AB Data from Ghana and Cote d'Ivoire, for local dung beetle assemblages of rain forest, plantations, and savanna, suggest that a subset of the savanna fauna has expanded its range across the Eastern Guinean Forest ecoregion, presumably in response to its conversion from continuous rain forest into an archipelago of forest fragments within a disturbance matrix of less shady plantation and farmland vegetation that more resembles moist savanna.

AB Foliar endophytic fungi live inside healthy plant leaves, and in some cases they confer herbivore resistance to the host. All previous studies of endophyte-herbivore interactions have occurred in temperate areas, and many use correlations rather than experiments. In Panama, Glomerella cingulata is a common endophyte species found in healthy leaves, and Chelymorpha alternans is a common herbivore on Merremia umbellata, a tropical vine. We manipulated the abundance of G. cingulata in the leaves of M. umbellata. We then assessed the effects of high and low endophyte densities on the food choice, development, and reproductive success of the leaf beetle, C. alternans. In 'choice' experiments, adult females with a history of feeding on wild plants showed no preference when offered food plants with high and low endophyte densities. Further, in 'no-choice' experiments, C. alternans larvae that were fed high- or low-density endophyte leaves did not differ in development or survivorship. However, when larvae fed on leaves with low endophyte densities became adults, they produced 80 percent more offspring. This suggests high endophyte levels in hosts can have a negative effect on herbivore fecundity. Further experiments are necessary to understand whether the reproductive effects are due to feeding on low-density endophytes in the larval or adult stages, and whether changes in reproductive success are motivated by the adult's perception of food quality or by physiological constraint due to food quality.

AB Termites play important roles in organic matter decomposition, nutrient cycling, and soil structure in tropical rain forests. When forests are replaced by agriculture, termite species richness, abundance, and function often decline. We compared the termite assemblage of a primary forest site with that of a low plant diversity, palm-based agroforest (five plant species) and a high plant diversity, home-garden agroforest (10 plant species) using a rapid biodiversity assessment protocol. In comparing the primary forest termite species composition to previously published studies, we found soil feeders and the Apicotermitinae to be more dominant than previously reported in Amazonia. Thirty percent of the species belonged to the Apicotermitinae, and an unusually high percentage (57%) of species were soil feeders. Unexpectedly, the palm-based agroforest, despite its lower plant diversity, was closer to primary forest in termite species composition, rate of species accumulation, and proportions of species in taxonomic and functional classes than was the home-garden agroforest. This suggests that particular plant attributes may better determine the termite assemblage than plant diversity alone in these agroecosystems. Unlike other agroecosystems reported in the literature, Apicotermitinae and soil feeders were proportionally more abundant in these agroforests than in primary forest. The ability of agroforests to support populations of soil feeders has a potentially positive effect on soil fertility in these agroecosystems; insomuch as feeding guild is a proxy for function, these closed-canopy agroforests may be able to sustain the same termite-mediated functions as primary forest.

AB The nutritional demands of animals vary by taxon. Across landscapes, communities of animals experience variability in the stoichiometry of carbon and nutrients within their resource base. Thus, we expect stoichiometry to contribute to the spatial variance in the demographic parameters of animal communities. Here, we measure how the composition of a litter-nesting tropical rainforest ant community is influenced by spatial variation in environmental stoichiometry relative to litter biomass, a known predictor of ant density. We found the density of ants and their nests were strongly related to litter biomass and carbon: phosphorus stoichiometry. The spatial variation in soil nutrients, which determines leaf litter stoichiometry, was an excellent predictor of nest size in the two most common genera of ants. We found a negative relationship between species' growth rate and local soil stocks of phosphorus. Overall, the density of litter-dwelling ants varied greatly across this tropical forest landscape and environmental stoichiometry can account for limits on ant density independent of the biomass of the leaf litter resource base.

AB Patterns of movement and space usage are important components of the ecology of any organism. Among snakes, this information is often lacking even for species that are abundant, ecologically important, and/or relevant to human health. We used radiotelemetry to examine the spatial ecology and behavior of the fer-de-lance (Bothrops asper), a highly venomous pit viper that is ubiquitous throughout much of Central America. Sixteen adult snakes were tracked over 2 yr in lowland rainforest of Costa Rica to determine home range, movement patterns, and foraging behavior. Consistent with previous descriptions, B. asper was found to be a highly nocturnal ambush predator, exhibiting virtually no activity during the day. Overall home range was determined using both minimum convex polygon (mean size = 5.95 ha) and 95 and 50 percent kernel density (mean size = 3.71 and 0.370 ha, respectively); home range size did not differ between males and females by any estimation method. Movement pattern was largely aseasonal and unrelated to any observed environmental conditions other than the daily low temperature. Most movements consisted of short (< 10 m) movements between daytime shelter and nocturnal ambush sites within a given area, interspersed with longer distance (> 50 m) movements to new foraging areas. Compositional analysis of habitat usage indicated an avoidance of developed areas and selection of swamp habitat. Most snakes had several activity cores (50% kernel density), the majority which were in or near swamps. These patterns suggest that space and habitat usage of fer-de-lance may be related to foraging strategy.

AB Strong hurricanes can cause population reductions in West Indian birds and bats, but the genetic consequences of such reductions have not been documented. For three species of phyllostomid bats, we report on the genetic effects of three strong hurricanes that struck the northern West Indies in 2004. Hurricane Ivan devastated Grand Cayman and severely depressed populations of several bat species. Despite being smaller than pre-hurricane levels, the population of Artibeus jamaicensis (the only species we could resample) on Grand Cayman contained greater mitochondrial haplotype diversity but similar microsatellite allelic diversity compared to pre-Ivan levels. We suggest that hurricane-aided dispersal from Cayman Brac introduced two new haplotypes into the Grand Cayman population. In the Bahamas, two other phyllostomids (Erophylla sezekorni and Macrotus waterhousii) did not suffer population losses or changes in genetic diversity as a result of Hurricanes Frances and Jeanne. Our results suggest that strong hurricanes usually have greater demographic than genetic effects but that hurricane-aided dispersal can occasionally introduce new genotypes or haplotypes into island bat populations.

AB I estimated habitat-specific population densities for a population of Bornean white-bearded gibbons Hylobates albibarbis inhabiting seven distinct forest types at Gunung Palung National Park, West Kalimantan, Indonesia. Population densities in montane forests (0.44 individuals/km(2)) were almost ten times lower than those in the next best habitat (upland granite forest; 4.2 individuals/km(2)) and far lower than those in lowland forest types. Demographic data on 33 gibbon groups living across the seven forest types showed that reproduction was substantially depressed in montane forests compared to high-quality lowland habitats. A simple model suggests that montane forests are demographic sinks for gibbons at Gunung Palung. Follow-up data from observations of montane groups 5 yr after the initial observation period support this result. As high-quality lowland forests (source habitat for gibbons) are being disproportionately lost in and around Gunung Palung National Park due to illegal logging and conversion to oil palm plantations, an increasing percentage of the remaining forest in the park comprises sink habitat for gibbons. This result has disquieting implications for the long-term viability of gibbon populations at Gunung Palung. In addition, as montane forests are generally low-quality habitat for most rainforest vertebrates, and since lowland forests are being lost at alarming rates across the tropics, source-sink population dynamics similar to those I describe here may characterize populations of other tropical vertebrate species.

AB This study shows for the first time that terrestrial tank bromeliads from Brazilian restinga can act as natural traps for dispersed palm Euterpe edulis seeds. Such bromeliads, which are shade intolerant, gain benefits by limiting palm recruitment since they hinder canopy formation and, consequently, increase luminosity over its aggregates.

AB The ectomycorrhizal (EM) canopy tree Dicymbe corymbosa (Fabaceae subfam. Caesalpinioideae) forms monodominant forests in the Pakaraima Mountains of western Guyana. Like other tropical monodominants, D. corymbosa has several life-history traits that promote conspecific clumping, in contrast to density-dependent recruitment limitations characterizing most tropical trees. Dicymbe corymbosa forests, occurring in Guyana as patches within a largely non-EM mixed-species forest matrix, are important habitats for a diverse assemblage of EM fungi. Ground-based studies have not adequately determined the regional extent of D. corymbosa forests, nor are they practical due to the rugged, remote nature of the Pakaraima Mountains. We assessed the suitability of Landsat satellite imagery for mapping regional distribution of D. corymbosa forests in Guyana's Upper Potaro River Basin. Supervised image classification was performed on images from August 1989 (Landsat-5 TM) and October 1999 (Landsat-7 ETM+). In situ forest reference data were used to quantitatively assess accuracy of output classification maps. Classification performed well in distinguishing monodominant from mixed-species forests. For both images, D. corymbosa forest class accuracy was good (1989 user's accuracy = 89.8%, K(hat) = 0.74; 1999 user's accuracy = 80.7%, K(hat) = 0.59). The resulting output classification maps will be useful for planning fungal surveys and ecological studies in forests of the Pakaraima region. Classification of Landsat images may be effective for identifying monodominant forests in other remote regions of the tropics.

AB Studies of tropical rain forest beta-diversity debate environmental determinism versus dispersal limitation as principal mechanisms underlying floristic variation. We examined the relationship between soil characteristics, terrain, climate variation, and rain forest composition across a 3000 km(2) area in northeastern Costa Rica. Canopy tree and arboreal palm species abundance and soils were measured from 127 0.25-ha plots across Caribbean lowlands and foothills. Plot elevation, slope, temperature, and precipitation variation were taken from digital grids. Ordination of forest data yielded three floristic groups with strong affinities to foothills and differing lowland environments. Variation in floristics, soil texture, and climate conditions showed parallel patterns of significantly positive spatial autocorrelation up to 13 km and significantly negative correlation beyond 40 km. Partial Mantel tests resulted in a significant correlation between floristic distance and terrain, climate and soil textural variables controlling the effect of geographical distance. Separate comparisons for palm species showed significant correlation with Mg and Ca concentrations among other soil factors. Arboreal palm species demonstrated a stronger relationship with soil factors than did canopy trees. Correlation between floristic data and geographical distance, related to seed dispersal or unmeasured variables, was not significant after controlling for soil characteristics and elevation. Canopy trees and palms showed differing relationships to soil and other environmental factors, but lend greater support for a niche-assembly hypothesis than to a major role for dispersal limitation in determining species turnover for this landscape.

AB Tropical hardwood hammocks, among the rarest and most threatened vegetative communities in the United States, occur throughout the 225-km Florida Keys archipelago as it extends toward the Caribbean from the southeast tip of peninsular Florida. Compounding their critical conservation status, tropical hardwood hammocks and the dynamics that support their peculiar species diversity in the region are poorly understood. The goal of this study was to explore the dynamics of the species compositional gradient of the hammocks along the Florida Keys, and to identify significant ecological units within the gradient. The primary data for this research were assembled from the Institute for Regional Conservation's floristic database of South Florida. We were able to extract presence/absence data for 295 species from comprehensive surveys of 23 study sites. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling was used to deconstruct the compositional trends into a reduced ordination space. Cluster analysis was subsequently used to identify discrete ecological units. Additionally, we used vector fitting to interpret the significant correlated ancillary variables. Our main results were three well-fitted nonmetric multidimensional scaling axes with three nonoverlapping ecological units. Of the ancillary variables, latitude, longitude, percent composition from biogeographical regions, richness, and area were correlated to the nonmetric multidimensional scaling results. These results increase our understanding of the community structure of the hammocks along the Florida Keys, and can contribute to increasing our ability to adequately protect and restore tropical hardwood hammocks and other similar tropical dry forest communities throughout the Caribbean.

AB Although many animal species consume herbaceous vegetation found in African tropical forests, little is known of the temporal and spatial availability of these plants. From September 2004 to August 2005 we conducted a study that quantified the temporal and spatial biomass availability of 20 species of herbs frequently consumed by endangered mountain gorillas at two locations (Buhoma and Ruhija) in Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda. In general, the biomass of herbs varied over the study period, but these changes were relatively small. For 12 of 18 and nine of 11 species in Buhoma and Ruhija, respectively, herb biomass differed significantly among habitat types. Of the nine species found in both locations, seven species had a higher biomass at Ruhija, one species had a higher biomass at Buhoma, and one species showed no difference. These results demonstrate that herb biomass varied little temporally but spatial differences in herb biomass were more pronounced. Future studies should investigate the variables that may influence herb phenological patterns such as rainfall, light, soil quality, previous disturbance regimes, and animal foraging and trampling damage.

AB We evaluated temporal patterns of seedling survival of eight Neotropical tree species generated under multiple abiotic and biotic hazards (vertebrates, disease, litterfall) in the forest understory on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. Seedlings were transplanted at first leaf expansion in low densities along a 6-km transect and damage and mortality were recorded for 1 yr. We also planted and monitored small and large artificial seedlings to estimate physical disturbance regimes. During 0-2 mo after transplant, vertebrate consumers of reserve cotyledons caused high mortality of real seedlings, but little damage to artificial seedlings. On real seedlings after 2 mo, disease became an important agent of mortality, despite a decrease in overall mortality rates. Damage by litterfall remained relatively low during the 1-yr study period. Survival ranks among species showed ontogenetic shifts over time, as species changed susceptibility to the mortality agents. Survival after 2 mo was positively correlated with stem toughness, not because species with tough stems were less likely to receive mechanical damage, but because they survived better after receiving mechanical damage. Within each transplant station, artificial seedlings were not good predictors of litterfall damage experienced by real seedlings. Forest-wide litterfall damage level, however, was similar for both real and artificial seedlings (ca 10%/yr), a moderate level compared to other tropical forests. In conclusion, species traits including biomechanical traits interact to create complex temporal patterns of first year seedling survival, resulting in ontogenetic shifts that largely reflect changes in the relative importance of vertebrate consumers relative to other hazards.

AB Understory herbs are an important and species-rich component of tropical forests, but little is known about factors limiting recruitment of these herbs. In a Peruvian flood plain forest, we studied seedling recruitment of the widespread clonal herb Heliconia metallica. We analyzed natural recruitment and experimentally added seeds, excluded predators and removed the understory vegetation at occupied and unoccupied sites to test whether seed limitation, predation, disturbance, and the presence of mature conspecific plants influence seedling recruitment. The number of naturally recruited seedlings was higher at flooded sites and close to flowering H. metallica ramets. Predation caused considerable seed loss shortly after sowing. Seed survival strongly increased with the openness of a site, but was not affected by the presence of mature conspecifics. Seed addition increased the number of seedlings at both occupied and unoccupied sites. Two years after sowing, the number of established seedlings and their size increased with light availability at a site. In experimentally disturbed plots, light availability, seedling establishment, and survival were higher. The effect of disturbance on seedling survival was stronger at occupied sites, probably due to strong light competition from mature H. metallica plants. Herbivore damage on leaves of seedlings was lower at occupied sites, but seedlings grew faster at unoccupied sites. We conclude that seedling recruitment of H. metallica depends on natural disturbance and is limited by both seed availability and the presence of mature conspecific plants.

AB Most bamboos are semelparous. Their synchronous masting events occur on a cycle of 3-120 yr and represent an extremely pulsed resource for granivorous birds. Although many bird species feed occasionally on bamboo seeds, there are constraints to specializing on such a fluctuating resource and few bird species are known to specialize on bamboo seeds. Three of these bird species are endemic to the Atlantic forest of South America: the purple-winged ground-dove Claravis godefrida, buff-fronted seedeater Sporophila frontalis, and Temminck's seedeater Sporophila falcirostris. All three species are irregularly recorded in the province of Misiones, Argentina. We compared the temporal and spatial patterns of records of these birds in Misiones to masting events of the five common bamboos: yatevo Guadua trinii, takuaruzu Guadua chacoensis, takuapi Merostachys claussenii, pitinga Chusquea tenella, and takuarembo Chusquea ramosissima. All bird records coincided with times and places where Guadua bamboos (G. trinii and G. chacoensis) were known or estimated to have seeds. None of the bird species occurred during masting events of Merostachys or Chusquea, unless Guadua was also masting. We discuss relevant ecological and morphological features of the birds that might bear on their association with Guadua bamboos and that might be key to their conservation.

AB Call rate suppression is a common short-term solution for avoiding acoustic interference in animals. It has been widely documented between and within frog species, but the effects of non-anuran calling on frog vocalizations are less well known. Heterospecific acoustic interference on the calling of male Oophaga pumilio (formerly Dendrobates pumilio) was studied in a lowland, wet tropical forest in SE Nicaragua. Acoustic playback experiments were conducted to characterize the responses of O. pumilio males to interfering calls of cicadas, two species of crickets, and a sympatric dendrobatid frog, Phyllobates lugubris. Call rate, call bout duration, percent of time calling, dominant frequency, and latency to first-call were analyzed. Significant call rate suppression was observed during all stimulus playbacks, yet no significant differences were found in spontaneous call rates during pre- and postplayback trials. Dominant frequency significantly decreased after P. lugubris playback and first-call latency significantly decreased in response to both cicada and tree cricket playbacks. These results provide robust evidence that O. pumilio males can dynamically modify their calling pattern in unique ways, depending on the source of the heterospecific acoustic interference.

ID BREEDING BIOLOGY; AERODRAMUS
AB Biscutate swift Streptoprocne biscutata nests are usually built on protected rocky cliff walls. Birds often renest at the same location. Remains of previous nests may offer information about potential nests and quality of nest-sites. Here, we experimentally study nest-site selection to test the hypothesis that information from previous nests is used in current nest-site selection. We placed old nest material at artificial nest-sites to test whether new nest-sites are chosen based on the presence of nesting material. We also tested whether the use of natural nest-sites is influenced by nesting material by creating two types of natural sites: previously used natural nest-sites with vestiges of old nests removed and never used natural nest-sites to which vestiges of old nests were added. In the first experiment, in 139 nest-use opportunities, 16 artificial nest-sites were used, all of which included vestiges. In the second experiment, in 91 nest-use opportunities, four nests were in previously unused but natural locations to which vestiges had been added, 22 nests were in previously used sites without vestiges, and the remaining 65 nests remained unused. Two processes are apparently in action: first, prior experience and memory; second, vestiges indicate where nesting has occurred, possibly useful for first breeding, or for imperfect memory. Previous nesting information may explain why swifts use nesting locations for many years and why new nesting colonies seldom form. This transmission of information suggests that swifts tend to be conservative and nest where previous nesting has occurred.

AB Species richness and composition of bird assemblages found in the understory of undisturbed Neotropical forests vary at local and regional scales but the extent of that variation has not been well documented. Yet, such variation can be important for understanding patterns of diversity and for conservation. Here, we use capture data from two ca 100-ha study plots (sampled from March 2001 through March 2005) to compare understory assemblages at a local scale; nets on the plots were separated by approximately 1.7 km at the closest point. A total of 157 species (133 per plot) was represented in 6023 captures of 4001 individuals. After eliminating species not likely to be well-sampled with nets, there were 122 species total with 110 and 113 on the two plots, respectively. Species-accumulation curves and abundance-rank relationships were almost identical on both plots. Capture rates were high (53 and 56 birds captured per 100 mist-net-hours, mnh) on both plots. Distributions of species and individuals among families and genera were similar on the two plots but numbers of captures of some common species differed between plots in response to small-scale variation in environmental features. Indicator-species analyses selected seven species as more characteristic of one plot and nine as more characteristic of the other. At the regional level, understory assemblages were most similar to a site in Peru but differed from sites in Brazil, Venezuela, and, especially, Costa Rica. Dissimilarity in species richness per family was related to geographic distance only when Costa Rica was included in the analysis.

AB Habitat fragmentation is one of the greatest threats to biodiversity. Despite their importance for conservation, the genetic consequences of small-scale habitat fragmentation for bat populations are largely unknown. In this study, we linked genetic with ecological and demographic data to assess the effects of habitat fragmentation on two species of phyllostomid bats (Uroderma bilobatum and Carollia perspicillata) that differ in their dispersal abilities and demographic response to fragmentation. We hypothesized that population differentiation and the effect of habitat fragmentation on levels of genetic diversity will be a function of the species' mobility. We sequenced mtDNA from 232 bats caught on 11 islands in Gatun Lake, Panama, isolated from the mainland for ca 90 yr, and in adjacent, continuous forest on the mainland. Populations of both species showed significant genetic differentiation (F-ST). Consistent with our prediction, population subdivision was lower in the highly mobile U. bilobatum (F-ST = 0.01) compared to the less vagile C. perspicillata (F-ST = 0.06), and only the latter species showed a pattern indicative of isolation by distance and, in addition, an effect of fragmentation. Genetic erosion as a result of fragmentation was also only detectable in the less mobile species, C. perspicillata, where haplotype diversity was lower in island compared to mainland populations. Our results suggest that some Neotropical bat species are prone to loss of genetic variation in response to anthropogenic small-scale habitat fragmentation. In this context, our findings point toward mobility as a good predictor of a species' vulnerability to fragmentation and altered population genetic structure.

AB The impacts of tropical deforestation and forest degradation on SE Asia's biotas have been documented, but a quantitative synthesis is currently lacking. We examined the responses of biodiversity to anthropogenic forest disturbance by comparing key ecological attributes between undisturbed and neighboring disturbed forests. Based on data from four taxonomic groups (vascular plants, invertebrates, birds, and mammals), six broad measures of 'ecological health' (e.g., richness, abundance, and demographics), and a range of different impact types from 120 articles published, we calculated the proportion of pairwise comparisons in which the measure of ecological health was lower in impacted than in pristine sites, as would be expected if forest disturbance was detrimental. The explanatory power of correlates of disturbance sensitivity was assessed using an information-theoretic evaluation of a candidate set of generalized linear models (GLMs). Overall, 73.6 percent (95% CI = 70.8-76.2%) of 1074 pairwise comparisons supported the expectation that forest disturbance was detrimental to ecological health, with mammals being the most sensitive group. The median effect size was for pristine areas to have 22.2 percent higher ecological health than equivalent disturbed areas. The most responsive measure of ecological health was species richness (median = 28.6% higher in pristine), and agricultural areas were the most ecologically degraded (median = 35.6% higher in pristine). However, the GLMs revealed no marked differences overall between taxonomic groups, habitat impact types, or ecological health measures. Our finding implies that the sensitivity of biodiversity to forest disturbance is moderately high, but essentially universal, suggesting urgent forest conservation actions.

AB Tree regeneration is severely hampered in the fragmented afromontane forests of northern Ethiopia. We explored how trees regenerate in remnant forests along the gradient from open field, forest edge to closed sites and canopy gaps inside the forest. We investigated the effects of seed sowing, litter removal, and weeding on the regeneration success along this gradient. Regeneration success was investigated for four indigenous tree species, and measured in terms of seedling establishment, growth, and survival. Species performed differently according to site conditions. Within the forest, local canopy openings facilitated seed germination (Ekebergia), seedling growth (all species except Olea), or survival (Ekebergia and Olea), suggesting that all species benefited from local high light conditions in the forest. Outside the forest, germination (all species) and growth rates (Juniperus and Olea) were lower in the open field, most probably due to water stress in the dry season. Outer edge conditions favored growth for three of the four species. Natural seed germination was, however, zero at any site for Juniperus and Olea and low for Ekebergia and Prunus in the open field. Soil scarification influenced germination positively, while weeding did not have a positive effect. These results suggest that simple measures may improve seedling establishment, and that, for some species, forest edges are particularly useful for growth and survival after succesful establishment. Together with erecting fences, needed to protect seedlings against grazing, seed sowing, planting seedling, and soil scarification may contribute to maintain and restore church forests in the fragmented landscapes of northern Ethiopia.

AB Guaiacum sanctum (lignumvitae, guayacan) comprises economically important and globally endangered trees endemic to the dry neotropics. These trees were historically over-harvested and now G. sanctum is among the species listed by IUCN and CITES. Guaiacum sanctum was once found throughout the Florida Keys, but anthropogenic habitat fragmentation and exploitation have left only one significant population, on Lignumvitae Key. The ecology of this population is additionally subject to hurricane-mediated effects and an endemic parasite. Genetic profiles were determined for the Lignumvitae and putative source populations of G. sanctum to assess variability and to test biogeographic hypotheses. These data were analyzed by phylogenetic and statistical parsimony analyses. The results were most readily interpreted as indicating historical fragmentation followed by long-term isolation. However, recent dispersal or gene flow could not be entirely excluded. Both types of analyses strongly support a significant genetic divergence between Caribbean and Mexican populations of G. sanctum and also suggest bidirectional dispersal of G. sanctum into Lignumvitae Key from both the Caribbean and Mexico. These results inform the process of restoring G. sanctum in the Keys.

AB Rain forests are expected to be amongst the ecosystem types most affected by fragmentation due to their high species diversity, high endemism, complexity of interactions, and contrast with surrounding altered matrix. Due to their shorter life cycles and dependence on canopy cover, rain forest understory herbs are expected to indicate the effects of recent fragmentation more rapidly than canopy trees. This study investigated all four known species of the genus Romnalda, all of which are rare rain forest herbaceous species, to investigate the possible effects of habitat fragmentation and isolation on genetic diversity and gene flow. Allozymes were used as genetic markers and regional remnant vegetation maps were used to compare landscape fragmentation. We found that R. strobilacea populations in a highly fragmented landscape were genetically depauperate compared with those of its congeneric species that are found within continuous rain forest habitats and that allelic diversity decreased with decreasing population size but not geographic distance in R. strobilacea. Given the similarity among the species, our results indicate that all Romnalda species are potentially susceptible to loss of genetic diversity due to habitat fragmentation within relatively short timeframes. The results indicate that populations are not highly genetically differentiated and there is little evidence of genetic provenance where the species have restricted geographic ranges. Thus, species recovery programs would be better to focus on maintaining population size and genetic diversity rather than population differentiation.

AB The 2006 completion of the circum-island Compact Road on the island of Babeldaob in the Republic of Palau resulted in several deforested stream reaches with modified stream channels. To determine the impacts of deforestation and road construction, various ecosystem parameters were compared between road-impacted reaches, reforested savanna reaches, and forested reaches. Compared to adjacent forested reaches, road-impacted reaches received significantly more light (0.4 +/- 0.1 vs. 87.8 +/- 4.1 % light transmittance, respectively), were significantly warmer (25.7 +/- 0.1 vs. 26.1 +/- 0.1 degrees C, respectively), and received higher nutrient and sediment loads, all of which were attributed to the removal of riparian vegetation and increased surface runoff from the road. These differences were believed to have shifted the benthic algal community in road-impacted reaches from diatoms to filamentous algae with significantly greater chl a biomass (10x) and benthic algal ash free dry mass AFDM (3x) compared to adjacent forested reaches. Savanna-impacted and forested reaches had similar chl a, algal AFDM, and received similar amounts of light. Nutrient and sediment concentrations varied between the two reach types. Results from this study emphasize the need for the maintenance of riparian forests especially with predicted increases in population, development, and deforestation. Future studies are needed to determine effective riparian widths and riparian forest community structure to help resource managers and land owners protect and preserve the many ecosystem services that Palauan streams and watersheds provide.

AB Spatial and temporal variation in the below-canopy light environment of tropical forests is not well known and its measurement is technically challenging. Distributions of gap and understory areas in forests are likewise little known because of the resource requirements of forest structural censuses and a lack of consensus over how gaps should be defined. A basic model of forest structure, based on tree allometries from the 50 ha Forest Dynamics Plot on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama, and a solar positioning algorithm were used to predict spatial and temporal variation in the distribution of direct light at the forest floor. Predicted duration of direct sunlight was then compared with the distribution of gap and understory areas, delimited according to four standard gap definitions, giving predictions for the correspondence between direct light regimes and forest structure. At least 36 percent of the areas of gaps of all sizes was predicted to receive < 1 h of direct sunlight per day, and the understory to receive direct sunlight for >= 1 h per day in up to 15 percent of its area, even when not in proximity to gaps. The predicted distribution of light changed over the course of the year with the greatest spread of light throughout the forest floor coinciding with the months when maximum daily solar elevation peaked. These predictions suggest a partial decoupling of light regimes from canopy structure, with implications for gap definitions, patch models of forest development and current understanding of tree seedling recruitment patterns.

AB Large-fronded tree ferns are critical components of many tropical forests. We investigated frond and whole-plant allometries for Hawaiian keystone species Cibotium glaucum, for prediction and to compare with global scaling relationships. We found that C. glaucum fronds maintain geometric proportionality across a wide range of plant and frond sizes. These relationships result in strong allometries that permit rapid field estimation of frond size from simple linear dimensions. C. glaucum frond allometries complied with intra- and interspecific global trends for leaf area versus mass established for much smaller-leafed species, indicating 'diminishing returns' in photosynthetic area per investment in mass for larger fronds. The intraspecific trend was related to declining water content in larger fronds, but not to a significantly larger investment in stipe or rachis relative to lamina. However, C. glaucum complied with the global interspecific trends for greater allocation to support structures in larger leaves. Allometries for frond number and size versus plant height showed that as plants increase in height, frond production and/or retention progressively declines, and the increases of leaf size tend to level off. These frond and whole plant-level relationships indicate the potential for estimating frond area and mass at landscape scale to enrich studies of forest dynamics.

AB Typhoons are an important meteorological feature of the tropical southwest Pacific. However, little is known about their effects on aquatic plants. Here, we describe the potential influence of typhoons on the diversity and distribution of aquatic plants on Hainan Island, South China. Using a combination of field survey and published data, 266 species or sub-species belonging to 115 genera in 57 families were found across typhoon impacted regions of the island. Multiple regression analysis indicated that species richness of aquatic plants was correlated with typhoon incidence rather than the area of aquatic habitat within each region. Heavy rainfall, flooding, and strong winds are likely to create suitable habitats and increase the diversity of aquatic habitats in regions frequently affected by typhoons, which may explain the higher species richness found in those regions. Beta diversity and cluster analyses showed that distinct aquatic floras occurred in regions that were impacted by different typhoon pathways. By comparing the aquatic floras of the Philippines and the typhoon-affected regions of Hainan, we suggest that typhoons have the potential to transport aquatic plants long distances, although there are a number of other potential explanations for the patterns observed in the aquatic flora of Hainan Island.

AB We tested whether local abundance of rain forest trees in the medium elevation wet forests of the southern Western Ghats (WG) was related to environmental tolerance, life form, and geographical range. We selected trees in medium elevation wet forests (750-1700 m asl) of the southern WG, using two data bases: a small plot (30 x 30 m) data base of 288 species of trees (>= 3 cm dbh) in 33 plots totaling 2.97 ha, and a data base of 135 species of tree (>= 10 cm dbh) in larger plots of 1 ha each, totaling 4.84 ha. The species density per hectare and number of records in the plot network was used in a factor analysis to give a measure of the local abundance of each species. The altitude and seasonality ranges of these species in the WG was assessed from independent data bases and used to generate an environmental tolerance score. Results indicated that as a species became locally more abundant, it occurred across a wider range of environmental gradients, but regional distribution was not related to geographical distribution. Understory species tended to be rarer with smaller range sizes and lower environmental tolerances than overstory species. Climate change is predicted to have drastic effects on restricted range species with limited environmental tolerances.

AB Insect herbivores were collected from five species of dipterocarp tree seedling within a large-scale reciprocal transplant experiment in Sabah, Malaysia, on alluvial and sandstone soils in both gap and understory plots. The aim was to determine whether the location and ecological specialization of seedlings influenced the herbivore communities found on and around them. Three major groups of folivores were collected: Coleoptera, Orthoptera, and larval Lepidoptera. Herbivory of all species was confirmed through laboratory trials. Herbivore abundance in the understory plots was extremely low relative to the gaps. Rank-abundance curves were similar on both soil types, differing only within the Lepidoptera. Coleoptera and Orthoptera communities were numerically dominated by a small suite of species capable of feeding on all dipterocarp species tested, whereas lepidopteran communities had both greater species richness and diversity. When corrected for leaf area surveyed, the abundance of Coleoptera was similar on both soil types, while larval Lepidoptera were more abundant in sandstone plots and Orthoptera were more abundant in alluvial plots. Estimated species richness of all three taxa was greater in alluvial forest, but there were contrasting patterns in Simpson diversity and evenness between groups. Species richness of Lepidoptera was greatest on seedlings when grown in their native soil type, providing partial evidence for possible escape effects, although this was not matched by differences in folivore abundance. The link between herbivore communities and herbivory rates on rain forest tree seedlings is complex and is unlikely to be detected through simplistic measures of abundance, species richness, or diversity.

AB Females of an orchid bee, Euglossa viridissima, recently naturalized in southern Florida, routinely collect resin to construct their brood cells from the flowers of two Clusia (Clusiaceae) and two Dalechampia (Euphorbiaceae) species. We demonstrated that the bee pollinates three of these species including: (1) the newly naturalized D. scandens, which it pollinates in Mexico; (2) the ornamental D. aristolochiifolia native to Peru; and (3) the ornamental C. lanceolata native to Brazil, but not the apomictic Clusia rosea native to Florida. Field observations indicated that the bee promotes outcrossing in a naturalized D. scandens population. Comparisons of fruit set between unmanipulated control flowers and flowers supplemented with additional pollen indicated that the presence of bee eliminates pollen limitation for cultivated C. lanceolata. The orchid bee's pollination of ornamental resin-reward plants may promote their naturalization.

AB In this paper we address the effects of anthropogenic disturbance and replacement of Brazilian Coastal sandy vegetation (restingas) on dung beetles communities. We sampled dung beetles in the four main vegetative physiognomies of Guriri Island, Espirito Santo State: forest restinga, restinga Clusia, disturbed restinga (from burning events), and pastures. We placed four sets of two pitfall traps (baited with horse and human dung) in four independent areas of each vegetation type, and collected 14,534 individuals of 13 dung beetle species. Neither log(10) of individuals nor log(10) of species richness were good predictors of restinga disturbance. However, a significant amount of variation in dung beetle abundance and richness could be explained by bait type. Ordination of these sites using hybrid multidimensional scaling revealed a gradient of habitat disturbance from undisturbed restinga samples to pasture. Dung beetle communities along this gradient demonstrated a complete turnover in species composition, from restinga-specialists to invasive and generalists species respectively. This complete turnover signals the local extirpation of forest-adapted species in disturbed and converted areas. Only a single dung beetle species in preserved restingas is protected by Brazilian law (Dichotomius schiffleri). Given the extent of the clearing of restinga habitat, the conservation status of dung beetles associated with restinga forest gives cause for concern.

AB Sampling oribatid mites in large areas using conventional methods is expensive, time-consuming, and this constrains their use in environmental monitoring programs. We used samples collected in 38 plots of 3.75 ha spread over 30,000 ha in an Amazonian savanna to evaluate the reduction in costs and person-hours in sampling and sorting and to elaborate cost-effective protocols. Ten samples per plot were collected and extracted using a Berlese-Tullgren apparatus. In the laboratory, samples were reduced to 50, 25, 12.5, and 6.25 percent of the initial content. Field-effort reduction was estimated by reducing the number of subsamples per plot. Dissimilarity matrices were generated using Bray-Curtis, Sorensen, and Chao-Sorensen indices. Correlations between each reduced-effort dissimilarity matrix and 100 or 50 percent sorting were used as an index of how much information was retained in reduced-effort sampling, and could still be used in multivariate analyses. The effects of most predictor variables on mite composition were detected in data based on every level of sample reduction. The intensive sampling was insufficient to reveal the full oribatid-mite fauna in the savanna; as more plots were sampled, more species were recorded. Our data indicate subsampling protocols for biodiversity assessment of oribatid mites in savanna that increase field and laboratory efficiency, and optimize both taxonomic and ecological aspects of the investigation.

AB In tropical forests, light-gaps created from treefalls are a frequent source of habitat heterogeneity. The increase in productivity, through gap formation, can alter food quality, predation and their impact on insect herbivores. We hypothesized that in gaps, herbivores would be less resource-limited and more predator limited, whereas in the understory, we predicted the reverse. In this study, we investigate the combined effects of food quality and predation on the lepidopteran larva Zunacetha annulata feeding on its host plant Hybanthus prunifolius in two habitats; sunny treefall gaps and the shaded understory in Panama. In bioassays, Z. annulata feeding on sun leaves ate 22 percent less leaf area, grew 25 percent faster, and had higher pupal weights than larvae feeding on shade leaves. However, shade leaves had higher nitrogen content and specific leaf area. In gaps, predation was 26.4 percent compared to 13.8 percent in the understory. Larvae on understory plants traveled greater distances and spent more time searching and traveling than larvae on gap plants. These differences in behavior are consistent with lower predation risk and lower quality food in the understory. Using data from bioassays and field experiments we calculated 0.22 percent and 1.02 percent survival to adulthood for larvae in gaps and the understory, respectively. In conclusion, although these habitats were in close proximity, we found that larvae in the understory are more resource-limited and larvae in gaps are more predator limited.

AB Shaded coffee agroecosystems traditionally have few pest problems potentially due to higher abundance and diversity of predators of herbivores. However, with coffee intensification (e.g., shade tree removal or pruning), some pest problems increase. For example, coffee leaf miner outbreaks have been linked to more intensive management and increased use of agrochemicals. Parasitic wasps control the coffee leaf miner, but few studies have examined the role of predators, such as ants, that are abundant and diverse in coffee plantations. Here, we examine linkages between arboreal ant communities and coffee leaf miner incidence in a coffee plantation in Mexico. We examined relationships between incidence and severity of leaf miner attack and: (1) variation in canopy cover, tree density, tree diversity, and relative abundance of Inga spp. shade trees; (2) presence of Azteca instabilis, an arboreal canopy dominant ant; and (3) the number of arboreal twig-nesting ant species and nests in coffee plants. Differences in vegetation characteristics in study plots did not correlate with leaf miner damage perhaps because environmental factors act on pest populations at a larger spatial scale. Further, presence of A. instabilis did not influence presence or severity of leaf miner damage. The proportion of leaves with leaf miner damage was significantly lower where abundance of twig-nesting ants was higher but not where twig-nesting ant richness was higher. These results indicate that abundance of twig-nesting ants in shaded coffee plantations may contribute to maintenance of low leaf miner populations and that ants provide important ecosystem services in coffee agroecosystems.

AB A widely accepted biodiversity crisis in the tropics has been recently challenged by claims that secondary forests will gradually restore biodiversity losses. This prediction was examined for the herpetofauna in Quintana Roo, Mexico. Quantitative sampling (108 transects) of reptiles was undertaken monthly (January-September 2004) along a vegetation gradient covering induced grasslands, and regrowth and primary rain forests. A total of 35 species was found, 14 being present in and five showing dependence on mature forests. Lizards contributed > 90 per cent of the individuals observed. Reptile abundance and snake species richness was highest in primary forests, even though the lower abundance and richness did not differ between regrowth forest and induced grasslands. Multivariate ordinations and ANOSIM tests displayed clear differences in assemblage structure among vegetation types, mainly caused by contrasting abundances of lizard species having distinctive arboreal or terrestrial habits. There was no evidence that snake assemblages differed between secondary forests and induced grasslands. Microhabitat availability had a key role in shaping species composition through the vegetation gradient. Our results dismiss the hypothesis that secondary forests can act as reservoirs of primary forest reptile diversity on the basis that many taxa depend largely on habitat quality and have specialized life-history traits, and that biological succession does not guarantee the recovery of assemblage complexity.

AB Sea turtle egg mortality, egg predation, and small organisms associated with turtle nests were studied at Playa Ostional, Costa Rica. Sites with concentrated sea turtle nesting were compared with solitary nesting sites as a function of place and time based on ANOVA, Akaike's Information Criterion, and Bayesian analyses. Results indicate that sea turtle egg mortality was significantly associated (P < 0.005) with flowing water that erodes or saturates nesting sites, and with overlapped nesting in which sea turtles disturb each other's nests. Sarcophagid and calliphorid fly larvae (Bayesian prior = 1.19; posterior = 2.27), fungi (prior = 1.14; posterior = 1.92), mites (prior = 0.51; posterior = 1.15), and several other types of small organisms increased in number after turtle egg laying (N = 303 nests; 34,451 turtle eggs). During peak sea turtle nesting periods, visitation to nesting sites by poachers and vertebrate predators was high, and relative number of nests disturbed by these predators was low (P < 0.02). In multimodel analysis, the three most parsimonious models were: (1) turtle egg mortality and distance from mean high tide; (2) turtle egg predation and distance from mean high tide; and (3) turtle egg mortality and nesting density, with Akaike weights of 0.224, 0.203, and 0.153 respectively. Intensive sea turtle nesting might result in upwelling and turnover of nesting debris and nest organisms, and may influence biotic community structure of sandy beach ecosystems.

AB Geophagy, the intentional ingestion of soil, is a widespread phenomenon whose function is still debated. Recent studies suggest that consumed soils adsorb dietary toxins and provide sodium. However, quantification of soil choice has been absent from most studies, prohibiting the direct comparison of soil use and characteristics. To determine correlates among bird use and soil characteristics, we analyze physical structure, mineral composition, and alkaloid adsorption (14 soil characteristics in total) for 22 soil samples from a riverbank 'clay lick' used by macaws and parrots (family Psittacidae) in Amazon lowland forests in the Tambopata region of southeastern Peru. We quantified bird preferences through photographic mapping. Mineral concentrations were determined using analyses designed to approximate the mineral availability in the vertebrate stomach. The sodium levels in the soil were much higher than in food plants consumed by parrots in this region. Both adsorption of quinine, the model alkaloid used, and sodium concentration correlated significantly with bird use. Sodium explained a much higher percentage of the variation in bird use than quinine adsorption. However, the analyses were complicated by the high degree of correlation among soil variables: clay percentage and sodium concentration were highly correlated with each other and with bird use, making it impossible to determine which of these may have the greater contribution to bird preference. The results suggest that the soils consumed provide an important source of dietary sodium and adsorb alkaloid toxins.

AB We describe patterns of tree community change along a 700-km transect through terra firme forests of western Amazonia, running from the base of the Andes in Ecuador to the Peru-Brazil border. Our primary question is whether floristic variation at large scales arises from many gradual changes or a few abrupt ones. Data from 54 1-ha tree plots along the transect support the latter model, showing two sharp discontinuities in community structure at the genus level. One is located near the Ecuador-Peru border, where the suite of species that dominates large areas of Ecuadorean forest declines abruptly in importance to the east. This discontinuity is underlain by a subterranean paleoarch and congruent with a change in soil texture. A second discontinuity is associated with the shift from clay to white sand soils near Iquitos. We hypothesize that the first discontinuity is part of an edaphic boundary that runs along the Andean piedmont and causes a transition from tree communities preferring richer, younger soils near the base of the Andes to those preferring poorer, older soils farther east. Because the floristic changes observed at this discontinuity are conserved for large distances to the east and west of it, the discontinuity is potentially key for understanding floristic variation in western Amazonia. The significant floristic turnover at the Ecuador-Peru border suggests that the only large protected area in the region-Ecuador's Yasuni National Park-is not adequate protection for the very diverse tree communities that cover vast areas of northern Peru.

AB Growth and death of fine roots represent an important carbon sink in forests. Our understanding of the patterns of fine root turnover is limited, in particular in tropical forests, despite its acknowledged importance in the global carbon cycle. We used the minirhizotron technique for studying the changes in fine root longevity and turnover along a 2000-m-elevational transect in the tropical mountain forests of South Ecuador. Fine root growth and loss rates were monitored during a 5-mo period at intervals of four weeks with each 10 minirhizotron tubes in three stands at 1050, 1890, and 3060 m asl. Average root loss rate decreased from 1.07 to 0.72 g/g/yr from 1050 to 1890 m, indicating an increase in mean root longevity with increasing elevation. However average root loss rate increased again toward the uppermost stand at 3060 m (1.30 g/g/yr). Thus, root longevity increased from lower montane to mid-montane elevation as would be expected from an effect of low temperature on root turnover, but it decreased further upslope despite colder temperatures. We suggest that adverse soil conditions may reduce root longevity at high elevations in South Ecuador, and are thus additional factors besides temperature that control root dynamics in tropical mountain forests.

AB We studied the growth of seedlings of native and invasive tree species from secondary tropical forests on Mahe (Seychelles). We were interested in whether native or invasive species are more drought-tolerant, and therefore conducted a garden (pot) experiment comparing the growth of seedlings of five native and five invasive tree species under different light (7% and 60% transmittance) and water (natural and repeated drought stress) conditions. Differences in the responses of native and invasive species to these treatments were small. In both groups, mean relative growth rates were reduced only slightly by intermittent drought that caused wilting of leaves. However, invasive species produced clearly thinner leaves (high specific leaf area, SLA) and more root biomass than native species under high light, while these differences were small under low light. Native species performed better than invasive species under low light with low water availability. It appears that high phenotypic plasticity allows some fast-growing invasive species to cope with water stress by adjusting the relative allocation of resources to aboveground and belowground structures under high light, while this strategy is not effective when both light and water resources are limiting. We conclude that water stress may reduce the invasibility of shaded habitats by fast-growing invasive species, while water stress in unshaded habitats may have less effect on invasive species than previously recognized.

AB The dioecious, tropical palm Mauritia flexuosa has high ecological and economic value, but currently some wild populations are harvested excessively, which is likely to increase. In this study, we investigated the population dynamics of this important palm, the effects of harvesting, and suggested sustainable harvesting regimes. Data were collected from populations in the Ecuadorian Amazon that were assumed to be stable. We used a matrix population model to calculate the density-independent asymptotic population growth rate (lambda = 1.046) and to evaluate harvesting scenarios. Elasticity analysis showed that survival (particularly in the second and fifth size class) contributes more to the population growth rate, than growth and fecundity. To simulate a stable population at carrying capacity, density dependence was incorporated and applied to the seedling survival and growth parameters in the transition matrix. Harvesting scenarios were simulated with the density-dependent population models to predict sustainable harvesting regimes for the dioecious palm. We simulated the removal of only female palms and showed how both sexes are affected with harvest intensities between 15 and 75 percent and harvest intervals of 1-15 yr. By assuming a minimum female threshold, we demonstrated a continuum of sustainable harvesting schedules for various intensities and frequencies for 100 yr of harvest. Furthermore, by setting the population model's lambda = 1.00, we found that a harvest of 22.5 percent on a 20 yr frequency for the M. flexuosa population in Ecuador is consistent with a sustainable, viable population over time.

AB The phenological behavior of many tropical plant species is highly dependent on rainfall, but these plants may also respond to changes in photoperiod. Without a better knowledge of the proportion of species responding to different factors, it is difficult to predict how global climate change may affect natural ecosystem processes. The aim of this study was to describe flowering patterns for more than 100 species in Tinigua Park, Colombia, and to propose which factors may trigger flower production (e.g., rainfall, temperature, cloud cover, and photoperiod). Data gathered in 5.6 km of phenological transects during 4 yr and complementary information indicated that the vast majority of species showed intraspecific synchronization, and annual production was the most common pattern, followed by episodic frequency. The annual patterns were common in tree species, while episodic patterns were common in lianas. Simple and multiple regression analyses suggested several aspects of photoperiod as the most likely triggers for flowering in most species. However, the fact that many of these species produce flowers in different periods each year, suggests that the proportion of species responding to photoperiodic cues is less that 23 percent in this community. The flowering times of taxonomically related species seldom showed significantly staggered distributions; however they do not necessarily occur at the same time, suggesting that flowering patterns are not strongly constrained by phylogeny.

AB It has been suggested that flowers of some plants are specialized for pollination by two unrelated species (or functional groups) of pollinators. However, evidence for 'bimodal pollination systems' has been extremely limited. Studies of the milkweed Xysmalobium undulatum in South Africa showed that its flowers are visited by a range of different insects (representing 18 families), but only two groups, represented by the chafer beetle Atrichelaphinis tigrina and pompilid wasps in the genus Hemipepsis, effect pollination. Experiments showed that both these pollinator groups are effective in removing and inserting pollinia. Pollinia are attached to clypeal hairs and mouthparts on the wasps and tarsal hairs and spines on the beetles. Although considerably less abundant than the beetles, Hemipepsis spp. wasps move more quickly among flowers and appeared to be more effective pollinators overall. Experimental hand-pollinations conducted in the field showed that X. undulatum is genetically self-incompatible and thus completely reliant on pollinators for reproduction. We conclude that X. undulatum has a bimodal pollination system, specialized for pollination by Hemipepsis pompilid wasps and the chafer beetle A. tigrina.

AB Visual cues in fruit displays from foliage, accessory structures, and ripe fruit color are known to be important in attracting bird seed dispersers to ripe fruit, but the role of color in unripe fruit has not been thoroughly studied. Here, we tested the effects of unripe fruit presence and fruit abundance by offering fruit of a Neotropical tree, Ardisia nigropunctata (Myrsinaceae), in bunches of mixed unripe and ripe fruit and bunches of all-ripe fruit. Additionally, foraging bird species identification and behavior information was collected. Contrary to expectation, birds removed more fruit from all-ripe bunches with the most fruit than from contrastingly colored fruit bunches. We therefore discuss alternate explanations for unripe fruit colors in mixed bunches.

AB Many Amazon River fishes consume fruits and seeds from floodplain forests during the annual flood season, potentially serving as important seed dispersers and predators. Using a participatory approach, this study investigated how within-season variation in flood level relates to fruit consumption and seed dispersal by two important frugivorous fish, Colossoma macropomum and Piaractus brachypomus, in two Lower Amazon River fishing communities in Brazil. Diets of both fish species were comprised of 78-98 percent fruits, largely dominated by a few species. Diets included fruits of 27 woody angiosperms and four herbaceous species from 26 families, indicating the importance of forest and Montrichardia arborescens habitat during peak flood. A correspondence between peak fruit species richness and peak flood level was observed in one of two communities, which may reflect higher forest diversity and/or differences in selection of fishing habitat. Both fishes are seed dispersers and predators, the relative role of which did not vary by flood level, seed size, or fish size, but may vary with seed hardness. Interspecific differences in diet volume and intact seeds suggest P. brachypomus are more effective seed dispersers than C. macropomum. Overall, the spatial and temporal variation in fruit species composition and richness demonstrate plasticity in fruit consumption in relation to flood level and locally available fruits. While such diets are adaptive to the dynamic changes of Amazon floodplain habitats, the high consumption of forest fruits and seeds from mid- and late-successional species suggests that floodplain forest degradation could disrupt seed dispersal and threaten local and regional fisheries.

AB The standardized 'Ants of the Leaf Litter' protocol aims to facilitate the use of ground-foraging and litter-dwelling ants in biodiversity assessment and monitoring programs. It was initially developed to characterize assemblages from tropical rain forests and is based on two main techniques: Winkler extractions and pitfall traps. Here, we tested to what extent this protocol was adapted to tropical dry forests and affected by the rainfall regime. Our 10 study sites were located along an aridity gradient (average annual rainfall: 350-1300mm) in the Gran Chaco. The number of species collected per sampling effort increased with aridity for pitfalls but followed an opposite trend for Winkler samples. This trend could be explained by the low daytime foraging activity in the leaf litter during drought periods. In arid and semiarid regions the good performance of pitfalls was probably related to their 24-h operation and to the attractiveness of the water they contained. Our results stress that the Winkler method used in the Ants of the Leaf Litter protocol may not be cost-effective during periods of drought and may lead to severe underestimations of litter ant diversity in tropical dry forests.

AB We examined bait preferences of litter ants along a successional gradient of forests in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. The ants preferred protein-based baits in secondary forests, yet preferred carbohydrate-based baits in old-growth forests. This suggests a shift in stoichiometric balances between secondary and old-growth forest which might have an impact on the functional interactions in these ecosystems. Therefore, the ecological services offered by secondary habitats may be quite different from those offered by old-growth forests.

AB In SE Asian rain forests, general flowering, a community-wide synchronous flowering, occurs at irregular and supra-annual intervals. During general flowering periods (GFP), most Dipterocarpaceae and many other trees flower profusely, while flowering plants are scant between GFP. During flowerless periods, anthophilous animals that depend on floral resources for food may suffer food shortages and subsequently decrease in abundance. Flower-visiting chrysomelid adults are major pollinators for some canopy tree species that flower during GFP. Although such chrysomelids feed on flower petals, the means by which they survive flowerless periods remains unknown. We determined the abundance of flower-visiting chrysomelids in GFP and non-GFP through light trap samples and examined the effects of the presence of young leaves and flowers of dipterocarps on local abundance, and feeding preferences of flower-visiting chrysomelids. We found no clear tendency that the chrysomelid species number and the abundance during GFP were consistently higher than those during non-GFP. Chrysomelid adults were more abundant on trees with many young leaves or flowers than on trees lacking young leaves and flowers. At least a few flower-visiting chrysomelids were observed feeding on young dipterocarp leaves and visiting young leaves and flowers of non-dipterocarps in the canopy during non-GFP. All results consistently suggest that chrysomelids are able to survive flowerless periods by feeding on the young leaves of dipterocarps and on the young leaves and flowers of non-dipterocarps; through this alternate feeding, chrysomelid populations are maintained at sufficient levels to function as effective pollinators of trees that flower during GFP.

AB We studied patterns of call acoustics and external morphological differentiation in populations of the dart-poison frog Allobates femoralis occurring in forested areas along a 250-km stretch of the upper Madeira River, Brazil. Multivariate analyses of variance using principal components representing shared acoustic and morphological parameters distinguished three groups in relation to call structure and external morphology: (1) populations belonging to a two-note call morphotype; (2) populations with four-note calls inhabiting the left riverbank; and (3) populations with four-note calls inhabiting the right riverbank. Our results report a case of Amazonian anuran diversity hidden by current taxonomy and provide evidence for the upper Madeira River being a boundary between distinct populations of A. femoralis, and suggest a new taxonomic interpretation for these groups. Samples that did not fit into the general differentiation pattern and the existence of a well-defined contact zone between two morphotypes on the left riverbank indicate that mechanisms complementary to river-barrier hypotheses are necessary to explain the phenotypic differentiation between populations. Our study shows that at least one anuran species shows congruence between population differentiation and separation by a large Amazonian river, as documented for birds and mammals. Conservation efforts should not consider the taxon now known as A. femoralis as a homogeneous entity. There is much within-taxon variability, which can be probably explained partly by the existence of cryptic species, partly by geological barriers and part of which currently has no obvious explanation.

AB Although open-cup nesting birds generally face increased risk of nest depredation from forest edge predators and brood parasites in fragmented temperate landscapes, little information exists to assess such risks in tropical birds. We compared nesting success of real birds' nests in large and small forest fragments to a control site in Caribbean lowland wet forest of Costa Rica. Pooling across species, nesting success was significantly greater in unfragmented forest than in either small, isolated fragments or the La Selva Biological Reserve, which is at the tip of a forest 'peninsula' embedded in a largely deforested landscape. Nesting success in isolated fragments did not vary according to distance from edge, suggesting that predators in fragments act throughout these forest patches. The case for increased nest predation as a plausible mechanism to explain the documented decline of forest interior bird populations in this fragmented tropical landscape is enhanced by a simple demographic model that suggests nesting success is likely too low to maintain populations at La Selva and in the fragments. The fact that the large (> 1000 ha) La Selva forest reserve is experiencing nest predation rates similar to those in much smaller fragments is cause for concern. Our results make a strong case for additional studies to document the identities of nest predators in both fragmented and unfragmented forests in such tropical forest landscapes.

AB Spatial subsidies of energy and nutrients can influence the distribution of consumers in riparian habitats. This study compared the abundance and composition of bird assemblages and the availability of volant insect prey within the riparian zone (<= 30 m from the stream) and further inland (100-250 m away) within a secondary forest in monsoonal Hong Kong. Replicated point-counts of birds and insect light trapping were conducted in each zone during the wet and dry season of 2006-2007. The biomass of adult aquatic insects in the riparian zone was nine to 12 times higher than inland during both seasons, however, total insect biomass (aquatic plus terrestrial insects) in the riparian zone was only 49 percent (wet season) and 18 percent (dry season) greater. More birds (both numbers of individuals and species) were recorded in the riparian zone, and this difference was particularly conspicuous during the wet season. Most of the wet-season difference was due to the greater number of insectivorous birds in the riparian zone (123% greater than inland), and may have reflected the relative availability of adult aquatic insects. These findings confirm the importance of riparian zones as feeding habitats for forest birds, and have implications for conservation planning and setting the boundaries of protected areas.

AB Here, we used radiotelemetry to determine home range and movement patterns of the frugivorous bat Sturnira lilium in a naturally fragmented landscape in Beni, Bolivia. Four females were monitored for up to 7 d. Based on 575 radiotelemetry positions, kernel home ranges were between 36.5 and 90.7 ha. During each night, bats visited most of their home range, which included forest islands and continuous forest; however activity was concentrated in core-use areas representing 6-12 percent of the home ranges. There was moderate overlap in home range and core-use areas among the four females. The mean long axis across the kernel home ranges was 1324 m. The results reported here show that S. lilium is able to move freely among forest elements in the landscape while crossing a savanna matrix. Hence, S. lilium may contribute to maintain connectivity and ecological processes in a fragmented landscape.

AB Hunting by humans may affect the abundance and activity patterns of game species. We examined the effect of hunting on the abundance and activity patterns of sympatric red brocket deer Mazama americana and dwarf brocket deer M. nana. We conducted four camera-trap surveys (158 sampling stations, 10,244 trap-days, total area sampled 1200 km(2)) in three areas within the Atlantic Forest of Misiones, Argentina, that differ in protection and hunting pressure. We used logistic regression and tests of independence to evaluate if protection, hunting pressure, and other independent variables affect the probability of recording each species and their recording rate. We used the Mardia-Watson-Wheeler test to examine if the daily activity pattern differs between species and changes with hunting pressure. Red brocket deer were more frequently recorded (397 records, 58% of stations) than dwarf brocket deer (100 records, 37% of stations). The probability of recording red brockets was higher in areas with better protection and increased with the distance to the main accesses used by poachers. The probability of recording dwarf brockets was higher in areas with low protection. Red brockets were more nocturnal than dwarf brockets, a difference that may reduce interspecific competition. However, red brockets were more diurnal in the best-protected areas, suggesting that they can adjust their activity to local hunting pressure. Hunting has opposite effects on the abundance of these deer and may facilitate their coexistence. Hunting should be carefully controlled or managed to ensure the conservation of these little known species.

AB The selection of suitable oviposition sites is crucial for successful reproduction of many organisms, including the endangered Madagascan frog Aglyptodactylus laticeps. In a preceding study, a conservation-oriented model of habitat use for this species extracted key habitat factors that reliably predict whether given ponds are used as oviposition sites. However, habitat-use models are descriptive and thus their explanatory power for true causal relationships between habitat variables and species distributions is presumably limited. Furthermore, these models are mostly insufficient with regard to incorporating dynamic components of habitat choice, such as the colonization history. Therefore, the explanatory power of habitat-use models within the context of dynamic components was experimentally investigated by creating artificial breeding ponds in the natural habitat of this frog species and manipulating two environmental factors within these breeding ponds. The absence of tadpoles proved to be the most decisive factor determining colonization. Leaf litter on the pond bottom, that had been suggested to be of importance by the habitat-use model, did not influence oviposition-site selection. Although pond characteristics may be important, the overriding factor affecting pond use in the experimental study was avoidance of pools that already contained tadpoles by ovipositing adults.

AB We reviewed 1333 papers published in Biotropica and the Journal of Tropical Ecology from 1995 to 2004. Only 62 percent of tropical countries were represented in our survey, with 62 percent of the publications based on research conducted in only ten countries. Sixty-two percent of papers had lead authors that were based at institutions outside the country where the research was conducted. Cross-national collaboration was limited, accounting for only 28 percent of papers with multiple authors. To evaluate if our choice of focal journals could have biased our results, we also reviewed 652 papers published in Ecology, Oecologia, Conservation Biology, and Biological Conservation for five randomly selected years from the same time period. While some differences in authorship and the geographic distribution of research existed, the results from these journals generally mirrored patterns observed in the two focal ones-almost 54 percent of publications were based on research conducted in only ten countries, and most studies had lead authors from a developed country. The results of our review suggest that the geographical distribution of research in the tropics is unequal, and that some important regions remain understudied. The results also suggest a need for a greater focus on establishing collaborative relationships with scientists from tropical countries.

DT Editorial Material
ID FORESTS
AB Ferraz et al. (2008) indicated the need for planning in biological monitoring in the Amazon, and reviewed what they considered recent progress. The problems and solutions they discuss are well known, and it is unlikely that many biologists would disagree with most of them. However, the authors do not indicate that most of these issues are already being addressed in practice in the Amazon, especially by the Programa de Pesquisas em Biodiversidade (PPBio) of the Brazilian Ministry of Science and Technology. The only major issue about which we do not agree with Ferraz et al. (2008) relates to the design of monitoring programs. The authors recommended tailoring experimental designs to specific threats, which will result in a multitude of idiosyncratic designs and incompatible data sets. We suggest that generic broad-scale designs will allow us to answer more questions with greater confidence, because the investment in each location provides information about regional and global questions. Although specific designs may be more effective in some cases, there are insufficient resources available to install different research infrastructure for every possible threat.

AB We surveyed postfire vegetation at five sites at high elevations (> 2000 m) in the Cordillera Central, Dominican Republic. Highlands of the Cordillera Central are dominated by a single pine species, Pinus occidentalis, but plant communities are rich with endemics and conservation and fire management efforts in these systems are ongoing. The burns were 2-7 yr in age and had consumed nearly all shrub crowns. Pines suffered high mortality (> 50%, all sites combined), but shrubs resprouted at high rates (88%, N = 957) after fire. All shrub taxa produced basal resprouts; eight of 11 shrub taxa measured had resprouting rates > 90 percent, while Baccharis myrsinites had the lowest (56%). Most taxa grew to prefire height quickly (within 5-7 yr), with regrowth of stem diameters lagging behind. Patterns and rates of shrub recovery resembled those documented in high elevation shrublands in Costa Rica and Brazil. Pinus occidentalis does not resprout, but larger individuals can survive fire. Survival increases dramatically when trees attain > 13-cm dbh, when bark becomes thick enough to protect cambial tissue. Overall, pines are regenerating much more slowly than shrubs, but seedling establishment varied considerably between sites. Frequent fires may cause a decline in pines and an increase in shrub- or grass-dominated communities. Succession in these high elevation fire-dependent pine forests favors taxa already present in the preburn vegetation, with woody composition changing little after fire, in contrast to lower-elevation cloud forest, where postfire vegetation has been shown to bear little resemblance to mature forest even after several years.

AB We analyzed successional patterns in a very dry tropical deciduous forest by using 15 plots differing in age after abandonment and contrasted them to secondary successions elsewhere in the tropics. We used multivariate ordination and nonlinear models to examine changes in composition and structure and to estimate forest recovery rates and resilience. A shrub phase characterized early succession (0-3 yr); afterwards, the tree Mimosa acantholoba became dominant. Below its canopy, sprouts and seed-regenerated individuals of mature forest species slowly accumulated. Canopy height, plant density, and crown cover stabilized in less than 15 yr, whereas species richness, diversity, and basal area continued to increase. The pioneer species group has very low diversity and the long-lived pioneer phase typical of humid forests is absent; species composition may therefore recover soon as suggested by convergence toward mature forest species composition. The time trend of plant density also differed from humid forests for it lacked its characteristic density decline, presumably because of differences in regeneration mechanisms between very dry and other less water-stressed forest types. As opposed to the prevailing hypothesis, resilience was not higher than in moister forests, and thus factors other than structure relative simplicity must be accounted for when assessing resilience.

AB The intensity of competition among forest tree seedlings is poorly understood, but has important ramifications for their recruitment and for the maintenance of species diversity. Intense competition among seedlings could allow competitively dominant species to exclude subordinate species. Alternatively, the low density and small stature of forest tree seedlings could preclude intense interseedling competition. In this case, other processes, such as size-asymmetric competition with adults, interactions with consumers, or neutral dynamics would prevail as those structuring the forest understory. We tested the intensity of, and potential for, intraspecific competition among tree seedlings of three species (Brosimum alicastrum, Matisia cordata, and Pouteria reticulata) in two Neotropical rain forests. We reduced stem densities by up to 90 percent and monitored individual growth and survival rates for up to 24 mo. Individual growth and survival rates were generally unrelated to stem density. Contrary to the predicted behavior of intensely competing plant populations, the distribution of individual heights did not become more left-skewed with time for any species, regardless of plot density; i.e., excesses of short, suppressed individuals did not accumulate in high-density plots. We further measured the overlap of zones of influence (ZOIs) to assess the potential for resource competition. Seedling ZOIs overlapped only slightly in extremely dense monodominant plots, and even less in ambient-density plots of mixed composition. Our results thus suggest that interseedling competition was weak. Given the low density of tree seedlings in Neotropical forests, we infer that resource competition among seedlings may be irrelevant to their recruitment.

AB Plant community composition is the combined result of species-specific competitive abilities and the availability of propagules. For epiphytic plants, current hypotheses consider that dispersal-related factors are most important. By controlling seed dispersal constraints, we experimentally examined whether the community composition of epiphytic bromeliads in a tropical premontane area is determined during early phases of seedling recruitment. Also, we tested whether establishment success was related to eco-physiological traits of the species. A total of 7200 seeds were artificially affixed on several host trees in two secondary forest patches and in a mature forest stand. Four bromeliad species with differing physiological characteristics (CAM, C-3-CAM, and C-3) and habitat preference (secondary vs. primary forest) were selected. We found that differences in seed germination probability among habitats and species were not likely to influence community assembly. After 2 yr, seedling survival and plant development were relatively higher in the early-successional forest. Seedling establishment success was not associated with specific physiological and morphological adaptations or habitat preference of the studied species. Our results were not consistent with the described community composition and rates of population recruitment of the studied species in the same successional habitats. The results support the hypothesis that chance and historic events related to seed dispersal have an important influence on community assembly of epiphytic plants. In addition, differences in growth rates and reproductive turnover among species are expected to influence the relative abundance and recruitment rates in a particular habitat.

AB The variation in leaf mass per area, leaf nutrients (% carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus), and the allometric relation between tree height and diameter of the black mangrove, Avicennia germinans, were explored in nine mangrove forests in similar environments along a 5 degrees latitudinal gradient in the central region of the Gulf of Mexico, as indicated by a southward increase in temperature and precipitation. There was no correlation between leaf nitrogen or phosphorus content and latitude. Leaf mass per area and leaf carbon content were positively correlated with latitude and negatively correlated with temperature and annual rainfall, whereas asymptotic tree height and maximum diameter showed the opposite trend. Such patterns suggest a trade-off between leaf traits and tree size which may be constrained by the same environmental factors along a dry-cold to humid-warm latitudinal gradient.

AB We studied foundress number and its effect on seed production in a dioecious fig Ficus fistulosa in Sarawak, Malaysia. The effects of flowering time and the two-way interaction of flowering time and tree location on foundress number were statistically significant. A multiple regression indicated seed production increased significantly with the number of foundresses. Our results indicate that phenology and local ecological factors generate a large variance in foundress number, which in turn affects the reproductive success of F. fistulosa.

AB Mating system and pollen flow are two key elements to understand the genetic structure of tree species. Mating and pollen-dispersal patterns of a low-density population of bat pollinated Hymanea courbaril were examined before logging in a 546-ha plot in the Brazilian Amazon. The multilocus genotypes of nine microsatellite loci were determined for 130 adult-trees and 367 seeds collected from 20 seed-trees. Mating system analysis, using mixed-mating model and paternity analysis showed that the studied population is perfectly outcrossed (t(m)= 1.002), and probably self-incompatible. However, significant deviations from random mating were detected for mating among relatives (t(m) - t(s) = 0.096, P < 0.05) and correlated matings (r(p) = 0.289, P < 0.05), indicating inbreeding in the population and that part of offspring are full-sibs (28.9%). Inbreeding was reflected in the positive and significant fixation index observed in adult trees (F = 0.137, P < 0.05), although no significant inbreeding was detected in offspring (F = 0.074, P > 0.05). The effective number of pollen donors mating with each seed-tree was determined to be low (N(ep)approximate to 4). The average of pollen flow distance was measured inside of the plot by both paternity (827 +/- 429 m) and TwoGener analysis (115-363 m). However, this underestimated pollen dispersal distance, since the detected rate of pollen immigration inside of the plot was high (55%). The observed long-pollen dispersal distance is probably related to pollination by bats and the low density of reproductive trees in the site.

AB All howler monkey species (Alouatta spp.) have a folivorous-frugivorous diet. Howler monkeys are reported to be seed dispersers in several areas, including black howlers (Alouatta caraya), which are important seed dispersers in northern Argentinean forests. The goal of this work was to study the three-way interaction between insects, seeds, and black howlers, and assess the functional significance of this tri-trophic interaction for seed dispersal. I determined through direct observation that fruits of species with a high proportion of insect infestation were important components of howler monkey diet. Ocotea diospyrifolia seeds from fresh faeces of black howlers contained dead larvae, but seeds were still able to germinate. Seeds in which larvae had reached an advanced stage of development did not germinate. Larvae of infested Eugenia punicifolia fruits were killed by digestion when they occurred in the pulp early in the fruiting season, but were dispersed alive with seeds later in the season. Banara arguta fruits contained both healthy and infested seeds; infested seeds were destroyed during digestion, while healthy seeds were dispersed. Black howlers' ingestion of infested fruits could result in the: (1) killing of larvae and dispersion of healthy seeds; (2) spread of larvae; or (3) destruction of infested seeds. This will depend on the relationship between the time at which fruit is consumed by black howlers, the time at which insect infestation occurs, and also probably on the hardness of the seed coat and the seed-insect size ratio.

AB Although many tropical stream consumers have large effects on resource quantity and quality, little is known about the relative importance of consumption versus bioturbation. We quantified egestion rates of freshwater shrimps (Atya spp. and Xiphocaris elongata) and mayflies (Leptophlebiidae) in two forest streams within the Luquillo Experimental Forest, Puerto Rico. Consumer body size was a strong predictor of egestion rates, with mass-specific egestion rates declining with body size and per-individual egestion rates increasing with body size. We used these egestion rates, together with published rates of epilithon removal by consumers and epilithon accrual by particle deposition and periphytic growth (i.e., with and without consumer access), to estimate the importance of consumption and bioturbation after storm events and during base-flow conditions. Our estimates suggest that direct consumption of epilithon can only account for a minor proportion (< 5%) of material removed following storm events, with most removal likely resulting from bioturbation. During base-flow conditions, we found that consumers (largely shrimps) may be capable of consuming a significant proportion of the material that would otherwise accrue on benthic substrata, but this result was limited to one high-elevation site. Our study suggests that bioturbation is the dominant process that redistributes and entrains fine particles after storm events, and that a variable fraction of deposited and accrued benthic material may be consumed during base-flow conditions. Our results underscore the importance of tropical stream animals in altering the benthic environment through both consumption and bioturbation, and suggest that consumer-mediated material cycling is likely to be context dependent.

AB Knowledge of survival rates of Neotropical landbirds remains limited, with estimates of apparent survival available from relatively few sites and species. We used capture-mark-recapture models to estimate apparent survival of 31 species from eastern Ecuador based on data collected from 2001 to 2006. Models assuming constant survival had highest support for 27 species; models incorporating effects of transients were highest for four. Average apparent survival across 30 species of passerines was 0.58 (+/- 0.02 SE); apparent survival was lower during the first interval after initial capture (phi(1): mean = 0.49 +/- 0.03) than during subsequent intervals (phi(2): mean = 0.60 +/- 0.02). Apparent survival was similar among three families represented by at least four species (Thamnophilidae: 0.57 +/- 0.03, N = 10; Furnariidae: 0.59 +/- 0.03, N = 5; Pipridae: 0.56 +/- 0.02, N = 4). There was no indication that species that occur in flocks had higher survival than nonflocking species (obligate flock members: 0.57 +/- 0.03, N = 10; facultative flock members: 0.56 +/- 0.04, N = 5; nonflocking: 0.59 +/- 0.03, N = 15). Comparisons of published estimates of apparent survival of tropical species demonstrated substantial differences among species and, in some cases, within species across different sites in the Neotropics. Our results support previous studies that concluded that early estimates of high (> 85%) survival in tropical birds may not be representative of all tropical species. Future studies should focus on understanding factors (e.g., life-history traits) that promote differences in survival among species within tropical forests.

AB Understanding coexistence between sympatric felines with similar body sizes, such as jaguars Panthera onca and pumas Puma concolor, requires knowledge of the way these predators consume and partition food resources. Yet the importance of livestock predation on jaguar and puma coexistence is poorly known. I investigated food habits and patterns of livestock depredation of jaguar and pumas in the Iguacu National Park (INP) in southern Brazil. From 1997 to 2001, I collected scats opportunistically on trails and roads in INP and visited ranches on the border of INP. I found that jaguars relied mostly on large and medium-sized wild prey species, while pumas concentrated on medium-sized prey species. Livestock was the fifth most frequent prey found in jaguar scats but the most important one in terms of biomass consumed. Jaguar and puma diets differed significantly when all prey items were compared and also when livestock was excluded from the jaguar diet. Jaguar predation on livestock was considerably higher than predation by pumas. However, predation was not substantial relative to availability of livestock, and cattle likely constitute an alternative source of prey for jaguars. Degree of diet overlap between jaguar and puma in INP suggests that coexistence was likely driven by exploitative competition through some degree of food partitioning. My results highlight the importance of more actions toward increasing numbers of large ungulates to preserve the population of jaguars in INP.

AB Black spider monkey Ateles chamek foraging data from eastern Bolivia are examined in relation to the size of fruit patches and the relative fruit density within the patch. In general, spider monkeys exhibited a preference for larger fruit patches and foraged for longer and in larger subgroups as patch size and relative fruit density increased. Nevertheless, results for specific resources revealed considerable variation in the primary variables influencing foraging behavior and subgroup size with certain specific resources more influenced by patch size, and others more influenced by relative fruit density. The results are discussed in relation to the foraging ecology of fission-fusion primate social systems and previous studies on the influence of patch size on primate foraging decisions.

AB Guidelines designed to aid in the restoration of rare species have been previously proposed using two primary strategies to select individuals for augmentation and reintroduction: mixing progeny from different populations or separating individuals from different populations. Understanding the genetic structure and diversity of an endangered species can offer insights into conservation management strategies. We used random amplified polymorphic DNA markers to assess the genetic structure and diversity of Jacquemontia reclinata, a federally endangered species endemic to Southeastern Florida. We sampled 20 percent of total number of individuals from eight of the ten known wild populations. Across individuals high levels of polymorphic loci (94.7%) were found and larger populations had greater genetic diversity. Cluster and ordination analyses found that one population was genetically differentiated from all the others; this population grows in a unique habitat. Most genetic variation (77.5%) was found within populations, and genetic distances between populations were not explained by their geographic distances. We recommend the use of two management units in restoration programs for J. reclinata, one consisting of the genetically differentiated population and the second consisting of the other seven populations sampled.

AB The southernmost extension of tropical Andean-Amazonian forests protrudes into the arid to semiarid habitats in northwestern Argentina. We analyzed the decline of species richness of forest mammals along these Yungas forests. In particular, we tested whether species decline is due to a general latitudinal effect and whether the drop of species from the assemblages was independent from species' traits and environmental variables. For these tests, we estimated the geographic range edges of 39 species of forest mammal and estimated the species richness with bands of 30'. First, we compared the slope of the decline of species richness from north to south (5.8 species/degree) with the decline expected from the latitudinal species gradient (1-3 species/degree). The decline in species richness of forest mammals along the Yungas was significantly steeper than expected. Second, with a null model assuming a random drop of mammal species we derived confidence limits for the expected species richness and number of range edges within the bands. None of the forest mammals reached the tip of the forest, in marked contrast to nonforest mammals. More range edges than expected from the null model fell within the bands 23 degrees 30'-24 degrees 00' S and a band near the tip of the Yungas indicating a nonrandom drop of species. The correlation between vulnerability traits and range edges suggests that processes associated with the availability of resources influence the drop of species. We propose that a suite of macroecological attributes interacting with a decrease in habitat quality determines the pattern of species richness in the Yungas forest.

AB Translocation experiments showed that a woodcreeper bird species is able to move between isolated forest fragments, but this ability is limited by increasing interpatch distances. Larger distances (> 100 m) were overcome by using small stepping-stones (isolated trees), which enhance connectivity and are useful for the species conservation in fragmented landscapes.

AB The majority of Hawaii's lowland wet forests no longer exist, with many of the last remaining patches found on the eastern, windward sides of the largest islands. To better understand successional patterns and invasion in these native systems, we quantified basal area (BA) and densities of woody species and understory cover at nine sites in the Puna district on the Island of Hawai'i, representing age gradients of native stand development on both 'a'a and pahoehoe lava flows. On both flow types, BA of native species increased (from 5 to 50 m(2)/ha) and stem densities decreased (from 3700 to 2600 stems/ha) with increasing stand/flow age. Both native and introduced species compositions diverged between substrate types on older flows. We found that lowland wet native forests remain at least partially intact in several locations, but their functional and compositional integrity is increasingly compromised by invasion of normative species, such as Tsidium cattleianum and Melastoma candidum, which become more common at sites greater than 300-yr old. This time period may represent a threshold, after which abiotic environmental conditions no longer constrain recruitment of introduced species. On older flows, normative stem densities swamped those of native species by an order of magnitude, with normative stems (height > 1.3 m) achieving densities as high as 18,000 stems/ha. In addition, all stands lacked recruitment of native woody species in the understory, suggesting that without management, the native components of these forests may soon no longer be self-sustaining.

AB This study examines how human land uses and biophysical factors serve as predictors of land cover change in and around Madidi National Park in Bolivia. The Greater Madidi Landscape ranges over an elevational gradient from < 200 m in the Amazon basin to 6000 m in the high Andes, contains more than ten major ecosystem types, and several protected areas and sustainable use zones. In this study, Landsat Thematic Mapper satellite images collected over the study area at the beginning of the 1990s and then the 2000s were classified according to broad land cover types. Below elevations of 3000 m, the landscape experienced equal rates of deforestation and secondary forest increases of approximately 0.63 percent annually, resulting in no significant net change. Below elevations of 1000 M, however, we found an annual net loss in forest cover of 0.11 percent. Across the landscape, land cover change was most likely to occur near areas previously deforested, near roads and population centers, and at low elevations. We found net deforestation rates to be inversely related to strength of natural resource protection laws in protected areas and other jurisdictions. Results suggest little net change for the landscape as a whole, but that local scale changes may be significant, particularly near roads. Management policies favorable for biodiversiry conservation in this landscape should limit the building of new roads and immigration to biologically sensitive areas and continue to support protected areas, which are achieving a positive result for forest conservation.

AB Leaffall phenology is an important periodical event in forests, contributing to mobilization of organic matter from primary producers to soil. For seasonal forests, leaffall periodicity has been related to rainfall regime and dry season length. In weakly seasonal forests, where there is no marked dry season, other climatic factors could trigger leafshed. In this study, we aimed to determine if other climatic variables (wind speed, solar radiation, photosynthetic photon flux density [PPFD], day length, temperature, and relative humidity) could be better correlated with patterns of litter and leaffall in a weakly seasonal subtropical wet forest in,Puerto Rico. Leaffall patterns were correlated mainly with solar radiation, PPFD, day length, and temperature; and secondarily with rainfall. Two main peaks of leaffall were observed: April-June and August-September, coinciding with the periods of major solar radiation at this latitude. Community leaffall patterns were the result of overlapping peaks of individual species. Of the 32 species analyzed, 21 showed phenological patterns, either unimodal (16 species), bimodal (three species), or multimodal (two species). Lianas also presented leaffall seasonality suggesting that they are subject to the same constraints and triggering factors affecting trees. In addition to solar radiation as a main determinant of leaffall timing in tropical forests, our findings highlight the importance of interannual variation and asynchrony, suggesting that leaffall is the result of a complex interaction between environmental and physiological factors.

AB Broad patterns across wild plant species show that leaf composition and morphology vary predictably among habitats, richer habitats favoring resource-acquisition strategies and poorer habitats favoring resource-conservation strategies. Domestication is often accompanied by a shift to richer habitats, and might thus be expected to lead to a shift in leaf composition and morphology and hence in photosynthetic parameters. We compared leaf photosynthetic parameters in domesticated cassava (Manihot esculenta) and a close wild relative, using greenhouse-grown plants. In domesticated cassava, CO(2) exchange rate expressed per unit mass and specific leaf area (SLA, m(2)/kg dry mass) were greater than in the wild relative, whereas leaf dry matter content (LDMC, dry mass/fresh mass) was lower in the domesticate. These results suggest that SLA and net photosynthetic rates may both have increased in the evolution of cassava under domestication, enabling more rapid growth in relatively resource-rich and protected agricultural habitats. Previous comparisons of photosynthetic rates in domesticated plants and wild relatives have usually considered only leaf area-based measures. Here, we discuss the interest of using mass-based rates to study the evolution of ecological strategies under domestication.

AB Allometric models are important for quantifying biomass and carbon storage in terrestrial ecosystems. Generalized allometry exists for tropical trees, but species- and site-specific models are more accurate. We developed species-specific models to predict aboveground biomass in two of the most ubiquitous natives in Hawaiian forests and shrublands, Metrosideros polymorpha and Dodonaea viscosa. The utility of the M. polymorpha allometry for predicting biomass across a range of sites was explored by comparing size structure (diameter at breast height vs. tree height) of the trees used to develop the models against trees from four M. polymorpha-dominated forests along a precipitation gradient (1630-2380 mm). We also compared individual tree biomass estimated with the M. polymorpha model against existing generalized equations, and the D. viscosa model with an existing species-specific model. Our models were highly significant and displayed minimal bias. Metrosideros polymorpha size structures from the three highest precipitation sites fell well within the 95% confidence intervals for the harvested trees, indicating that the models are applicable at these sites. However, size structure in the area with the lowest precipitation differed from those in the higher rainfall sites, emphasizing that care should be taken in applying the models too widely. Existing generalized allometry differed from the M. polymorpha model by up to 88 percent, particularly at the extremes of the data range examined, underestimating biomass in small trees and overestimating in large trees. The existing D. viscosa model underestimated biomass across all sizes by a mean of 43 percent compared to our model. The species-specific models presented here should enable more accurate estimates of biomass and carbon sequestration in Hawaiian forests and shrublands.

AB Water availability is the most important factor determining tree species distribution in the tropics, but the underlying mechanisms are still not clear. In this study, we compared functional traits of 38 tropical tree species from dry and moist forest, and quantified their ability to survive drought in a dry-down experiment in which witting and survival were monitored. We evaluated how seedling traits affect drought survival, and how drought survival determines species distribution along the rainfall gradient. Dry forest species tended to have compound leaves, high stem dry matter content (stem dry mass/fresh mass), and low leaf area ratio, suggesting that reduction of transpiration and avoidance of xylem cavitation are important for their success. Three functional groups were identified based on the seedling traits: (1) drought avoiders with a deciduous leaf habitat and taproots; (2) drought resisters with tough tissues (i.e., a high dry matter content); and (3) light-demanding moist forest species with a large belowground foraging capacity. Dry forest species had a longer drought survival time (62 d) than moist forest species (25 d). Deciduousness explained 69 percent of interspecific variation in drought survival. Among evergreen species, stem density explained 20 percent of the drought survival. Drought survival was not related to species distribution along the rainfall gradient, because it was mainly determined by deciduousness, and species with deciduous seedlings are found in both dry and moist forests. Among evergreen species, drought survival explained 28 percent of the variation in species position along the rainfall gradient. This suggests that, apart from drought tolerance, other factors such as history, dispersal limitation, shade tolerance, and fire shape species distribution patterns along the rainfall gradient.

AB What causes flowers to diverge? While a plant's primary pollinator should strongly influence floral phenotype, selective pressures may also be exerted by other flower visitors or competition with other plants for pollination. Species of the primarily bat-pollinated genus Burmeistera (Campanulaceae) frequently cooccur, with up to four species in a given site, and broadly overlap in flowering phenology, typically flowering throughout the year. The genus displays extensive interspecific variation in floral morphology in the degree that the reproductive parts (anthers and stigma) are exserted outside of the corolla, and species can be roughly classified as either long or short-exserted. I tested two hypotheses regarding the functional significance of such variation: (1) exsertion lengths correspond to pollination by bat species of different sizes; and (2) variation serves to partition pollinator's bodies spatially and thus reduces interspecific pollen transfer. I captured bats in Ecuador to evaluate the identity and location of the Burmeistera pollen they were carrying. Results show that exsertion does not correspond to specialization on different pollinators; different bat species carried pollen of both flower types just as frequently. In support of the second hypothesis, pollen from flowers of different exsertion lengths was found to occur on different regions of bats' heads. This may serve to reduce competition for pollination among coexisting Burmeistera.

AB We investigated the diet of the southern cassowary (Casuarius casuarius) by identifying the seeds and fruits in fecal droppings encountered on a set of transects over 2 yr in upland rain forest in the wet tropics of North Queensland. A total of 198 droppings containing 56 plant species were found. We surveyed fleshy fruit availability over the subsequent 68 mo on transects in the same area to ascertain fruiting patterns in the study area. The number of droppings found each month did not correspond to the pattern of available fruit biomass. There was no relationship between the fruit traits of moisture content, flesh to seed mass ratio, color, or crop size to contribution of a species to the diet. During the lean fruiting season (May-July) cassowaries relied more on species that fruited continuously throughout the year as they were significantly over-represented in droppings, while annual fruiting species were under-represented. During months of high fruit availability (October-December), continuously fruiting species were still over-represented in the diet but became less important while annual and biennial species became more important. Significantly more species with large fruit and large seeds appeared in the diet than expected and we confirm that the cassowary contributes to the continued dispersal of these species over long distances and in large quantities.

AB Montane evergreen forest in SE Asia is structurally and floristically different from lowland habitats. The response of large mammals to this variation is largely unexplored. We used sign transects to compare community structure of large mammals in montane (> 1100 m), and lowland (< 1100 m) forest types over 4 yr in western Thailand. Relative abundance of most ungulate species was significantly higher in lowland forest, except for elephant (Elephas maximus) and tapir (Tapirus indicus), which were most abundant in montane forest (based on chi-square tests of sign encounter rates). Sexual segregation was apparent for gaur (Bos gaurus): breeding herds were concentrated in the lowlands, whereas single males were most abundant in montane forest. Large cat abundance was similar in both elevation zones. Tapir, single gaur, and bears (Ursus spp.) characterized the montane mammal community whereas most other ungulate species and social groups were indicative of lowland forest (based on discriminant function analysis). Results pertain only to the dry season; seasonal movements could alter the patterns we observed. Differences in community structure between elevation zones are hypothesized to result from differences in habitat structure, resource availability, and human impacts. Lowland forests provide bamboo, grass, and mineral licks, probably accounting for higher ungulate densities despite higher levels of hunting. These resources are scarce in montane forest. However, montane forest functions as a refuge for at least three globally threatened large mammal species, because commercial hunting is concentrated in the more accessible lowlands.

AB Aphyllophoraceous fungi are expected to reflect changes in the environmental conditions caused by forest use. To reveal the effects of forest uses on the fungal community structure, we performed a 3-month survey of aphyllophoraceous species in five forest types (undisturbed primary forest, isolated patches of primary forest, old and young fallow forest, and rubber plantations) in Sarawak, Malaysia in 2005. We used a canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) to reveal the relationships between fungal community composition and the environmental variables (canopy openness, soil water potential, amount and composition of coarse woody debris, litter mass, basal area, plant species composition). A total of 155 samples from 67 species were collected during the study period. The fungal species density represented by the number of species in a transect differed significantly among forest types. The fungal species density increased significantly with increasing number of pieces of coarse woody debris (CWD), but decreased significantly with increasing the scores of second axis of principal component analysis (PCA) for plant species composition. In the CCA ordination, automatic forward selection revealed that only the number of pieces of CWD significantly affected the fungal species composition. The occurrences of Flabellophora licmophora, Coriolopsis retropicta, Microporus vernicipes, and Amauroderma subrugosum were positively correlated with the number of pieces of CWD. Our study clearly demonstrated that forest use negatively affected aphyllophoraceous fungal diversity and suggest that the quantity of CWD would be an important determinant of fungal diversity and composition.

AB By genetically characterizing adult individuals, we documented the presumed prefragmentation population structure of an endangered Andean tree, Magnolia espinalii. Our sample included all known surviving individuals for this species. Genetic diversity was high, but genetic distance was not related to geographic distance between sites. Magnolia espinalii apparently was originally distributed in numerous semi-isolated demes. The lack of evidence of recruitment around most adults in this species suggests a fragmentation-related disruption of their reproductive ecology. Artificial propagation projects should obviously attempt to involve all 23 known surviving trees.

AB The effect of forest disturbance on survival and secondary dispersal of an artificial seed shadow (N = 800) was studied at Brownsberg Natural Park, Suriname, South America. We scattered single seeds of the frugivore-dispersed tree Virola kwatae (Myristicaceae), simulating loose dispersal by frugivores, in undisturbed and disturbed secondary forest habitats. Seed survival rate aboveground was high (69%) within 2 wk and was negatively correlated with scatterhoarding rate by rodents, the latter being significantly lower in the undisturbed forest (9%) than in the disturbed forest (20%). Postdispersal seed predation by vertebrates was low (3%) and infestation of seeds by invertebrates was almost zero in all instances. Therefore, secondary seed dispersal by rodents in forest is not as critical for recruitment as observed among other bruchid-infested large-seeded species. Secondary seed dispersal by rodents may, however, facilitate seedling recruitment whether cached seeds experience greater survival than seeds remaining above ground surface.

AB We studied the potential role as seed disperser of the pacu fish (Piaracrus mesopotamicus, Characidae) in the Pantanal of Brazil. The most important food item in the diet of the pacu in the wet season was fruits of the palm Bactris glaucescens found in the guts of 73 percent of all fishes collected (N = 70). We found a positive relationship between fish length, weight, and gape size and the number of intact seeds in their gut. Therefore, large pacus are especially important in dispersing B. glaucescens seeds within the studied system. Since the best seed dispersers are the largest fishes, which are preferred by commercial fisheries, we predict that the ongoing over fishing in freshwater ecosystems will have major impacts on the dispersal system of fish-dependent plants. We suggest that it is paramount to change the attitudes in fisheries management of fruit-eating fishes and urgent to evaluate the impact of fishing on forest regeneration.

AB We developed an automated tree crown analysis algorithm using 1-m panchromatic IKONOS satellite images to examine forest canopy structure in the Brazilian Amazon. The algorithm was calibrated on the landscape level with tree geometry and forest stand data at the Fazenda Cauaxi (3.75 degrees S, 48.37 degrees W)in the eastern Amazon, and then compared with forest stand data at Tapajos National Forest (3-08 degrees S, 54.94 degrees W) in the central Amazon. The average remotely sensed crown width (mean +/- SE) was 12.7 +/- 0.1 m (range: 2.0-34.0 m) and frequency of trees was 76.6 trees/ha at Cauaxi. At Tapajos, remotely sensed crown width was 13.1 +/- 10.1 m (range: 2.0-38.0 m) and frequency of trees was 76.4 trees/ha. At both Cauaxi and Tapajos, the remotely sensed average crown widths were within 3 percent of the crown widths derived from field measurements, although crown distributions showed significant differences between field-measured and automated methods. We used the remote sensing algorithm to estimate crown dimensions and forest structural properties in 51 forest stands (1 km(2)) throughout the Brazilian Amazon. The estimated crown widths, tree diameters (dbh), and stem frequencies differed widely among sites, while estimated biomass was similar among most sites. Sources of observed errors included an inability to detect understory crowns and to separate adjacent, intermingled crowns. Nonetheless, our technique can serve to provide information about structural characteristics of large areas of unsurveyed forest throughout Amazonia.

AB The relationship between phenology and tree stem diameter increment is largely unexplored in tropical species, especially in wet tropical forests. To explore links between these phenomena, we measured stem diameter increment and phenology often canopy tree species from a range of functional types in the Atlantic lowlands of Costa Rica to test for seasonal and interannual patterns. We measured stem diameter increment using band dendrometers and visually assessed leaf and reproductive phenology monthly from 1997 to 2000. We categorized the species into groups based on patterns of leaf exchange and reproduction. Species were either deciduous with synchronous or asynchronous leaf drop, or evergreen with continuous or seasonal leaf flushing. Flowering occurred supra-annually, annually, or continuously. Of the ten species studied, four species, Cecropia insignis, Dipteryx panamensis, Lecythis ampla, and Simarouba amara, had consistent seasonal stem diameter increment patterns in both years. Dipteryx panamensis and L. ampla were deciduous with synchronized leaf drop. Cecropia insignis was evergreen and produced new leaves continuously. Simarouba amara, also evergreen, exchanged leaves over a brief period once a year. We tested whether stem diameter increment was correlated to phenology using logistic regression. Leaflessness significantly explained patterns in stem diameter increment but reproductive phenology did not. Deciduous trees were 2.6-9.3 times more likely to grow less than average the month following leaffall than in months when trees had full crowns.

AB Unlike the seriate lowland rain forests in SE Asia, the tropical vegetation of Xishuangbanna (SW China) has developed in habitats with comparatively lower temperatures and precipitation. Consequently, although most of the families and genera of the flora are components of tropical ecosystems, many have reached their distribution limits in latitude. Selection pressures on sexual systems in these environments may be different from that experienced in lowland tropical regions. Here, we examine the sexual systems of 685 species of flowering plants belonging to 109 families and 356 genera based on 42 plots with a total area of 15.4 ha and compare our results with surveys of sexual systems from other tropical ecosystems. Among these species, 60.6 percent were hermaphroditic, 14.3 percent were monoecious, and 25.1 percent were dioecious. The percentage of dioecious sexual system among tree species (26.1%) was similar or higher than that of other tropical tree floras. Monoecy was significantly associated with the tree growth form and was relatively common in seasonal forest vegetation. Sexual systems involving unisexual flowers (dicliny) are particularly well represented in the tropical forests of Xishuangbanna accounting for 39.4 percent of all species surveyed. This pattern may be associated with the prevalence of relatively small inconspicuous flowers in the tropical forests of SE Asia and their correlation with diclinous sexual systems generally.

AB Factors influencing the niche differentiation of epiphytes have been determined for the epiphytic bromeliads that coexist in the seasonally dry forest of Chamela, Mexico. Over 40 percent of the bromeliad epiphytes were distributed in only 5 percent of the trees. The occurrence of compound leaves in host trees was highly correlated with abundance of epiphytes, as these allow scattered light to penetrate throughout the canopy. The effect of leaf type overrides the effect of bark type, the main factor determining seedling establishment in moist forests. Eight species had the atmospheric life form, while only two species had tanks, formed by overlapping leaf bases and associated to a lower drought tolerance. Distribution in the canopy is counter to that observed in moist forests, since tank species occur in the upper canopy. Tank life forms showed most annual carbon gain during the rainy season, when the newly leafed out trees provide shade to the lower canopy. Atmospheric species had photosynthetic activity for longer into the dry period, possibly supported by dew and fog events. Leaf angles, orientation, trichome, and stomata densities are discussed in relation to water and light use among the species with contrasting ecological strategies.
