AB Research institutions from the Global North have made significant contributions to the knowledge of tropical ecosystems, but contributions have varied greatly between countries. We show that European nations that share a language, cultural affinity, and/or retain social and political ties with tropical countries (e.g., those with an overseas history) make larger contributions to tropical biological research than countries without these ties. However, exceptions to this pattern demonstrate how science policy agendas can skew the capacity of countries to conduct biological research in the tropics. We conclude that some countries could make a far more important contribution to tropical biological knowledge, but for this to materialize, greater commitment by a country's scientific community is needed, along with better financial and intellectual support from its public administrations.

AB Tropical tree species distributions are determined by a wide range of biotic and abiotic factors, including topography and hydrology. Tropical peat swamp forests (TPSFs) are characterized in part by small-scale variations in topography ('hummocks' and 'hollows') that create distinct microhabitats and thus may contribute to niche diversification among TPSF tree species. Using tree elevations calibrated to daily peat water levels collected using a data logger and a permutation test, we evaluated topographical microhabitat preferences for 21 tree species in a relatively undisturbed TPSF in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, to determine whether these species show preferential association with hummocks or hollows and to quantify the prevalence of microhabitat specialization among them. Only one species, Tetractomia tetrandrum, emerged as a hollow specialist, with no hummock specialists among the species tested. The remaining 20 species, including Psydrax dicoccos, which had the lowest mean observed elevation, and Maasia hypoleuca, which had the highest mean observed elevation, showed no clear microtopographic preference. This suggests that many TPSF species may be resilient to the natural hydrologic variations that occur in relatively intact peat swamp forests. Such studies of microtopographic preferences of tree species in TPSF and other wetland forest ecosystems can inform selection of tree species for reforestation projects, and potentially also provide information on how future climate change may impact these habitats and their resident tree species.

AB Liana density tends to increase with decreasing rainfall and increasing seasonality. However, the pattern of liana distribution may be due to differences in soil water retention capacity, not rainfall and seasonality per se. We tested the effect of rainfall and soil substrate with respect to the distribution of liana seedlings in six sites across a rainfall gradient from the wet Atlantic to the dry Pacific in central Panama. Soils were either limestone, with low water-holding capacity, or laterite, with higher water-holding capacity. We sampled liana seedlings at each site using three 1 x 100 m transect. We found that relative liana seedling density was higher on limestone soils compared to laterite soils regardless of the amount of rainfall. Furthermore, liana community composition on limestone soils was more similar to dry forest sites than to adjacent wet and moist forest sites. Liana seedling species diversity relative to trees was significantly higher in a low-fertility dry forest site compared to a high-fertility forest, but did not differ from the other sites. Thus, liana seedling density and community structure may be driven more by soil type and thus by soil moisture availability than strictly by mean annual rainfall and the seasonality of rainfall.

AB Savannas are widespread in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and play a major role in the global carbon balance. Extensive quantification of savanna carbon stocks in SSA will therefore contribute to better accounting of the global carbon budget in the era of climate change. In this study, we investigated the spatial distribution of carbon stocks of different soil fractions and aboveground biomass within three forest reserves in the Guinea savanna zone of Ghana. Soil carbon stocks (SCSs) ranged from 4.80 to 12.61 Mg C/ha in surface soils (0-10cm depth). Higher SCSs were associated with the silt +clay fraction than microaggregates and small macroaggregates in all three reserves. Relative to the dominant tree species (Vitellaria paradoxa), the highest SCSs were recorded under the sub-canopy (SC), drip line (DL), and interspace (2 * SC + DL) zones for the Klupene, Sinsablegbinni, and Kenikeni forest reserves, respectively. The highest tree carbon stock was 60.01 Mg C/ha in Kenikeni. Sinsablegbinni had an average stock of 26.74 Mg C/ha and had the highest tree density. Average carbon capture by a single tree ranged from 0.04 to 0.34 Mg C. Aboveground grass carbon stock ranged from 0.08 to 0.47 Mg C/ha, while the belowground carbon stock ranged from 0.03 to 0.44 Mg C/ha. Accumulation of carbon in the aboveground grass biomass was greater at Klupene with low forest cover.

AB Global changes in nutrient deposition rates are likely to have profound effects on plant communities, particularly in the nutrient-limited systems of the tropics. We studied the effects of increased nutrient availability on the seedlings of six tree species in montane forests of southern Ecuador insitu. After five years of continued N, P, or N+P addition, naturally grown seedlings of each of the two most common species at each elevation (1000, 2000, and 3000m asl) were harvested for analyses of leaf morphology, nutrient content, herbivory, and tissue biomass allocation. Most species showed increased foliar N and P concentrations after addition of each respective element. Leaf tissue N:P ratios of >20 in the control plants of all species suggest that P is more growth-limiting in these forests than N. Leaf morphological responses to nutrient addition were species and nutrient specific, with some species (Hedyosmum purparescens, Graffenrieda emarginata) exhibiting increased specific leaf area (SLA), and others (Graffenrieda harlingii) increased leaf area ratios (LAR). Pouteria torta (1000m) had lower SLA and LAR after P addition. Increased herbivory was only evident in G. emarginata (after N and N+P addition). Only the species from 3000m asl modified biomass allocation after nutrient addition. In general, N and N+P addition more strongly affected the species studied at the upper elevations, whereas P addition had a similar range of effects on the species at all elevations. We conclude that the responses of the studied tropical montane forest tree seedlings to chronic N and P addition are highly species-specific and that successful adaptation to increased nutrient availability will depend on species-specific morphological and physiological plasticity.

   PRODUCTIVITY
AB How plant species diversity affects traits conferring herbivore resistance (e.g., chemical defenses), as well as the mechanisms underlying such effects, has received little attention. One potential mechanism for the effect of diversity on plant defenses is that increased plant growth at high diversity could lead to reduced investment in defenses via growth-defense trade-offs. We measured tree growth (diameter at breast height) and collected leaves to quantify total phenolics in 2.5-year-old plants of six tropical tree species (N=597 plants) in a young experimental plantation in southern Mexico. Selected plants were classified as monocultures or as polycultures represented by mixtures of four of the six species examined. Tree species diversity had a significant negative effect on total phenolics, where polycultures exhibited a 13 percent lower mean concentration than monocultures. However, there was marked variation in the effects of diversity on defenses among tree species, with some species exhibiting strong reductions in phenolic levels in mixtures, whereas others were unresponsive. In addition, tree species diversity had no effect on growth, nor was the negative effect of diversity on chemical defenses mediated by a growth-defense trade-off. These results demonstrate that tree diversity can alter investment in chemical defenses in long-lived tree species but that such effect may not always be under strong control by plant endogenous resource allocation trade-offs. Regardless of the underlying mechanism, these findings have important implications for predicting effects on consumers and ecosystem function.

AB Habitat modification and biological invasions are key drivers of global environmental change. However, the extent and impact of exotic plant invasions in modified tropical landscapes remain poorly understood. We examined whether logging drives exotic plant invasions and whether their combined influences alter understory plant community composition in lowland rain forests in Borneo. We tested the relationship between understory communities and local- and landscape-scale logging intensity, using leaf area index (LAI) and aboveground biomass (AGB) data from 192 plots across a logging-intensity gradient from primary to repeatedly logged forests. Overall, we found relatively low levels of exotic plant invasions, despite an intensive logging history. Exotic species were more speciose, had greater cover, and more biomass in sites with more local-scale canopy loss. Surprisingly, though, exotic species invasion was not related to either landscape-scale canopy loss or road configuration. Moreover, logging and invasion did not seem to be acting synergistically on native plant composition, except that seedlings of the canopy-dominant Dipterocarpaceae family were less abundant in areas with higher exotic plant biomass. Current low levels of invasion, and limited association with native understory community change, suggest there is a window of opportunity to manage invasive impacts. We caution about potential lag effects and the possibly severe negative impacts of exotic plant invasions on the long-term quality of tropical forest, particularly where agricultural plantations function as permanent seed sources for recurrent dispersal along logging roads. We therefore urge prioritization of strategic management plans to counter the growing threat of exotic plant invasions in modified tropical landscapes.

AB Land use change is accelerating globally at the expense of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Invertebrates are numerically dominant and functionally important in old growth tropical rain forests but highly susceptible to the adverse effects of forest degradation and fragmentation. Ants (Formicidae) and termites (Blattodea: Termitoidae) perform crucial ecosystem services. Here, the potential effects of anthropogenic disturbance on ant and termite communities in dead wood are investigated. Community composition, generic richness, and occupancy rates of ants and termites were compared among two old growth sites (Danum Valley and Maliau Basin) and one twice-logged site (the Stability of Altered Forest Ecosystems' (SAFE) Project), in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. Occupancy was measured as the number of ant or termite encounters (1) per deadwood items, and (2) per deadwood volume, and acts as surrogates for relative abundance (or generic richness). Termites had a lower wood-occupancy per volume in logged forest. In contrast, there were more ant encounters, and more ant genera, in logged sites and there was a community shift (especially, there were more Crematogaster encounters). The disruption of soil and canopy structure in logged forest may reduce both termite and fungal decay rates, inducing increased deadwood residence times and therefore favoring ants that nest in dead wood. There is an anthropogenic-induced shift of dead wood in ants and termites in response to disturbance in tropical rain forests and the nature of that shift is taxon-specific.

AB Queen palm seeds (Syagrus romanzoffiana) are a vital source of nutrients for Ingram's squirrel (Guerlinguetus ingrami), a common inhabitant of the Atlantic forest biome of Brazil. G. ingrami acts as both a seed predator and disperser of this important palm; however, little is known about how G. ingrami selects or efficiently opens queen palm seeds. The objectives of this study were to: (1) investigate the squirrel's capacity to determine the germinal orifice among the fruit's three pores, which permits more efficient opening of the fruit; (2) assess whether the thickness and size of the fruit endocarp influence the squirrel's palm selection during foraging; and (3) evaluate whether the rodents preferentially select fruits with invertebrate infestations. To answer these questions, we used a series of behavioral experiments measuring patterns of squirrel feeding behavior (fruit opening, fruit selection, and patch selection), controlling for environmental variables. We found that (1) squirrels identify the queen palm germinal pore by its greater relative depth to the other pores; (2) the average size and thickness of fruit does not influence the squirrel's choice of palm for foraging; and (3) squirrels preferentially consume fruits infested by invertebrates. The development of methods for more efficient processing of queen palm fruit highlights the importance of this resource for G. ingrami. In addition, due to its preferential selection of infested fruits, G. ingrami may benefit palms by reducing parasite population loads.

AB Tent-making bats modify leaves to build refuges. Leaf modification involves energetic and defense costs that should be balanced by the benefits of tent-roosting. The alteration of the leaf's vascular system reduces the tent's life expectancy, so to obtain a benefit, bats are expected to use tents regularly as long as they remain functional and not modify more leaves than necessary. Over 2 yr, we documented the dynamics of tent construction and use by Uroderma convexum and other bat species in the palm Sabal mauritiiformis in a Colombian transitional dry forest. We also assessed tent condition and compared it to nonmodified leaves of approximately the same age in focal palms. Probability of tent use by U.convexum varied between 57 percent during a reproductive period and 4 percent outside of this period. Bats cut the main vein of folioles, partially affecting water transport in the leaf. However, there were no differences between tents and nonmodified leaves in deterioration scores or deterioration rates over 1 yr. During 2 yr, 48 tents were lost for different causes, but this loss was balanced by the construction of 51 new tents. Thus, bats maintained an excess of usable tents. Palm leaves are long-lived and seem preadapted to sustain damage and remain viable, particularly in species growing in dry environments. We present several hypotheses to explain the advantage of maintaining a tent surplus.

AB The taxonomic diversity (TD) of tropical flora and fauna tends to increase during secondary succession. This increase may be accompanied by changes in functional diversity (FD), although the relationship between TD and FD is not well understood. To explore this relationship, we examined the correlations between the TD and FD of ants and forest age in secondary forests at the alpha- and beta-diversity levels using single- and multi-trait-based approaches. Our objectives were to understand ant diversity patterns and to evaluate the role of secondary forests in the conservation of biodiversity and in the resilience of tropical forests. Ant assemblages were sampled across a chronosequence in the Lacandon region, Mexico. All species were characterized according to 12 functional ecomorphological traits relevant to their feeding behavior. We found that TD and FD were related to forest age at the alpha level, but not at the beta level. a- functional richness and divergence increased linearly with species richness and diversity, respectively. Also, the relationship between taxonomic and functional turnover was linear and positive. Our results indicated that functional traits were complementary across the chronosequence. The increase in FD was mainly driven by the addition of rare species with relevant traits. The older secondary forests did not recover all of the functions of old growth forest but did show a tendency to recovery. Because older successional stages support more TD and FD, we suggest developing agriculture and forestry management practices that facilitate rapid post-agricultural succession and thereby better preserve the functionality of tropical forests.

AB One explanation for the extraordinarily high tree diversity of tropical lowland forests is that it is maintained by specialized natural enemies such as insect herbivores, which cause distance and density dependent mortality. Insect herbivory could also explain the positive correlation between tree species richness and rainfall if herbivory increases with rainfall, is higher on locally abundant versus rare species, and is not limited by predation pressure at wet sites. To test these predictions, insect herbivory and predation pressure on insect herbivores were quantified across a Neotropical rainfall and tree species richness gradient, and herbivory was investigated in relation to local tree abundances. Insect herbivory on leaves (folivory) decreased strongly and significantly with rainfall, while predation pressure was significantly higher at the wetter site. Herbivores were more likely to attack abundant tree species, but herbivore damage levels were not related to tree species abundance. Insect folivores might contribute to local tree species coexistence in our system, but seem unlikely to drive the positive correlation between tree species richness and rainfall. The unexpected and contrasting patterns of herbivory and predation we observed support the need for a multi-trophic perspective to understand fully the processes contributing to diversity and ecosystem functioning.

ID SEED DISPERSAL; VEGETATION; CONSUMPTION; GERMINATION; BRAZIL
AB Adjacent floodplain and upland tropical forests experience the same temperature and precipitation regimes, but differ substantially in plant species composition and biotic interactions because of extensive flooding. We hypothesize that flooded forests filter fruiting traits linked to seed dispersal by water and fishes, such that selection by water and fish led to (1) trees that synchronize the timing of fruiting with annual floods, and (2) the evolution of fleshy tissues on fruits to improve buoyancy and increase fruit consumption rates by fish. To test this hypothesis, we compared plant communities in seasonally flooded forests and adjacent upland forest in terms of fruiting phenology, the frequency of trees bearing fleshy fruit, and the role of fleshy tissues in buoyancy and seed viability. Beta-diversity in this system is high, with significant differences in species composition across habitats. As predicted, the production of ripe fleshy fruits was significantly greater in flooded than upland forests during the flood season. Furthermore, we found that trees with fleshy fruit were significantly more abundant in flooded forests even though species richness of fleshy fruit-bearing trees was proportionally similar in flooded and upland forests. Additionally, fleshy pulp increased buoyancy. Likewise, time afloat decreased for denser fruit and those with high seed to pulp ratios. In concert, these results suggest that fleshy fruits in Neotropical floodplain forests facilitated hydrochory and ichthyochory. Once established, water and fish became important agents of selection on fruiting traits.

AB Large fish are often the most effective seed dispersers, but they are also the preferred target for fisheries. We recently started to comprehend the detrimental impacts of the extirpation of large frugivorous fish species on natural forest regeneration, but we lack a general understanding of how intraspecific size-selective harvest affects fish-fruit mutualism. Our literature review demonstrated that large individuals within populations positively affect diverse aspects of seed dispersal, from consuming a higher diversity of seeds to enhancing germination. Furthermore, we filled a research gap by studying how individual size variations within two small frugivorous fish species (<16 cm) affect seed dispersal in flooded savannas. Even within small-bodied species, large individuals swallow a higher number of intact seeds, but not necessarily a higher proportion. Overall, our results demonstrate the disproportional role of large-bodied individuals as key seed dispersers in flooded habitats. Consequently, fishing-down within both large- and small-bodied species can negatively affect seed dispersal and natural regeneration in overfished wetlands.

AB A species' thermal sensitivity and its exposure to climate variation are key components in the prediction of its vulnerability to climate change. We tested the thermal sensitivity of a tropical amphibian that lives in a mild constant climate in which the thermal tolerance range is expected to closely match the experienced environmental temperature. The air temperature that this species is exposed to varies between 21.9 and 31.6 degrees C with an annual mean of 27.2 degrees C. We estimated the microhabitat water temperature variation under vegetation shade, which buffers the temperature by 1.8 degrees C in relation to that of the air, and with open canopy, where the water was 1.9 degrees C warmer than the air temperature. With broods of tadpoles split into five treatments (15 degrees C, 21 degrees C, 28 degrees C, 31 degrees C, and 33 degrees C), we estimated the critical thermal maximum (CTMax) and critical thermal minimum (CTMin) after at least 7 days of acclimation. Both CTMax (42.3 degrees C) and CTMin (11.8 degrees C) were more extreme than the temperature range estimated for the field. We estimated the optimum temperature (T-o = 28.8 degrees C) and the thermal performance breadth (range: 23.3-34.1 degrees C) based on growth rate (g/day). The animals were able to acclimate more extensively to cold than to warm temperatures. These performance curve traits closely matched the air temperature. The estimated vulnerability varied according to the microhabitat prediction model used.

AB Beta diversity can provide insights into the processes that regulate communities subjected to frequent disturbances, such as flood pulses, which control biodiversity in floodplains. However, little is known about which processes structure beta diversity of amphibians in floodplains. Here, we tested the influence of flood pulses on the richness, composition, and beta diversity of amphibians in Amazonian floodplain environments. We also evaluated indicator species for each environment. We established linear transects in three environments: low varzea, high varzea, and macrophyte rafts. Species richness decreased and beta diversity increased according to the susceptibility of habitats to flood pulses. Indicator species differed among environments according to forest succession promoted by the flood pulse. The decrease in species richness between high and low varzea is due to non-random extinctions. The higher rates of species turnover between varzeas and macrophyte rafts are driven by the colonization of species adapted to open areas. Our results highlight that the maintenance of complex environments is needed to protect biodiversity in floodplains.

AB Frugivores must deal with seasonal changes in fruit availability and changes from year to year, as most species of tropical forest fruiting trees have considerable interannual variation in phenology and many are mast fruiters. We quantified seasonal and interannual changes in the fruit diet in a frugivore and important seed disperser, the white-handed gibbon, Hylobates lar, in Thailand. We used 40-d following data during April and May replicated in six consecutive years to study interannual variability in the diet and compared it with seasonal changes measured in monthly samples of the same size collected in three successive years. The 40-d periods of following also allowed us to measure the decline in dietary similarity with time over a finer scale. We measured fruit diet similarity between replicated 5-d periods using the percentage overlap (Renkonen's) index and Jaccard's similarity index. Seasonally, average dietary overlap between adjacent months was low, and similarity approached zero after four months. Average rate of decline in similarity exceeded 20 percent per 5-d period. Variation in fruit species in the diet between years was high and was correlated with interannual variation in fruiting phenology. The strongest correlation occurred in the case of Nephelium melliferum, a highly preferred species that dominated the diet in good fruiting years. It is difficult to separate changes in food species preference from changes in availability from year to year. We devised a relative measure of preference that depends on the degree to which the gibbons rely on prior knowledge to find sources.

AB Insect-fungal interactions are an important but understudied aspect of tropical forest ecology. Here we present the first large-scale study of insect communities feeding on the reproductive structures of macrofungi (basidiomes) in the Neotropics. This trophic interaction is not well characterized in most ecosystems; however, beetle consumption of basidiomes is thought to be affected by fungal factors, via mechanisms analogous to those observed in plant-herbivore interactions and in some interactions with fungi as hosts in the Holarctic region. We investigated how the composition of beetle assemblages varies as a function of fungal taxonomic distance, basidiome consistency, and hyphal systems. We collected 367 basidiomes belonging to the orders Polyporales and Hymenochaetales in the subtropical Araucaria angustifolia forest region of southern Brazil, along with any fauna present or without it. Basidiomes were maintained individually in the laboratory in plastic containers for up to three months to allow beetles to develop to adulthood, at which point the beetles were collected. We found that 207 basidiome specimens representing 40 species were associated with beetles. We recorded 447 occurrences of Coleoptera, representing 90 morphospecies from 20 families. We found that assemblages of fungivorous Coleoptera were more similar among more closely related fungi. Furthermore, the beetle assemblages varied as a function of basidiome toughness, which is influenced by sporocarp consistency and hyphal system type. The associations between beetles and basidiomes resemble those reported previously in temperate zones, suggesting continuity in the structure of such associations across a wide latitudinal range.

AB We developed a new modeling framework to assess how the local abundance of one species influences the local abundance of a potential competitor while explicitly accounting for differential responses to environmental conditions. Our models also incorporate imperfect detection as well as abundance estimation error for both species. As a case study, we applied the model to four pairs of mammal species in Borneo, surveyed by extensive and spatially widespread camera trapping. We detected different responses to elevation gradients within civet, macaque, and muntjac deer species pairs. Muntjac and porcupine species varied in their response to terrain ruggedness, and the two muntjac responded different to river proximity. Bornean endemic species of civet and muntjac were more sensitive than their widespread counterparts to habitat disturbance (selective logging). Local abundance within several species pairs was positively correlated, but this is likely due to the species having similar responses to (unmodeled) environmental conditions or resources rather than representing facilitation. After accounting for environment and correcting for false absences in detection, negative correlations in local abundance appear rare in tropical mammals. Direct competition may be weak in these species, possibly because the 'ghost of competition past' or habitat filtering have already driven separation of the species in niche space. The analytical framework presented here could increase basic understanding of how ecological interactions shape patterns of abundance across the landscape for a range of taxa, and also provide a powerful tool for forecasting the impacts of global change.

AB Why do some forests produce biomass more efficiently than others? Variations in Carbon Use Efficiency (CUE: total Net Primary Production (NPP)/Gross Primary Production (GPP)) may be due to changes in wood residence time (Biomass/NPPwood), temperature, or soil nutrient status. We tested these hypotheses in 14, one ha plots across Amazonian and Andean forests where we measured most key components of net primary production (NPP: wood, fine roots, and leaves) and autotrophic respiration (R-a; wood, rhizosphere, and leaf respiration). We found that lower fertility sites were less efficient at producing biomass and had higher rhizosphere respiration, indicating increased carbon allocation to belowground components. We then compared wood respiration to wood growth and rhizosphere respiration to fine root growth and found that forests with residence times < 40 yrs had significantly lower maintenance respiration for both wood and fine roots than forests with residence times > 40 yrs. A comparison of rhizosphere respiration to fine root growth showed that rhizosphere growth respiration was significantly greater at low fertility sites. Overall, we found that Amazonian forests produce biomass less efficiently in stands with residence times > 40 yrs and in stands with lower fertility, but changes to long-term mean annual temperatures do not impact CUE.

AB Despite its importance for carbon storage and other ecosystem functions, the variation in vegetation canopy height is not yet well understood. We examined the relationship between this community attribute and environmental heterogeneity in a tropical dry forest of southern Mexico. We sampled vegetation in 15 sites along a 100-km coastal stretch of Oaxaca State, and measured the heights of all woody plants (excluding lianas). The majority of the ca. 4000 individuals recorded concentrated in the 4-8 m height range. We defined three plant sets to describe overall community canopy height at each site: a set including all plants, a set made up by the tallest plants representing 10 percent of all individuals, and a set comprising the 10 tallest plants. For each site we computed maximum height and the mean and median heights of the three sets. Significant collinearity was observed between the seven resulting height variables, but null distributions constructed through bootstrap revealed their different behaviors as functions of species richness and density of individuals. Through linear modeling and a model selection procedure, we identified 21 models that best described the variation in canopy height variables. These models pointed out to soil (measured as PC1 of a principal component analysis performed on 10 soil variables), water stress, and elevation as the main drivers of canopy height variation in the region. In the event of increasing water stress resulting from global climate change, the studied tropical dry forests could become shorter and thus decrease their carbon storage potential.

AB Changes in land use strongly influence habitat attributes (e.g., herbaceous ground cover and tree richness) and can consequently affect ecological functions. Most studies have focused on the response of these ecological functions to land-use changes within only a single vegetation type. These studies have often focused solely on agricultural conversion of forests, making it nearly impossible to draw general conclusions across other vegetation types or with other land-use changes (e.g., afforestation). We examined the consequences of agricultural conversion for seed removal by ants in native grassland, savanna, and savanna-forest habitats that had been transformed to planted pastures (Brachiaria decumbens) and tree plantations (Eucalyptus spp.) and explored if changes in seed removal were correlated with differences in habitat attributes between habitat types. We found that land-use changes affected seed removal across the tree cover gradient and that the magnitude of impact was influenced by similarity in habitat attributes between native and converted habitats, being greater where there was afforestation (Eucalyptus spp in grassland and savanna). Herbaceous ground cover, soil hardness, and tree richness were the most important habitat attributes that correlated with differences in seed removal. Our results reveal that the magnitude of impact of land-use changes on seed removal varies depending on native vegetation type and is associated with the type of habitat attribute change. Our findings have implications for biodiversity in tropical grassy systems: afforestation can have a greater detrimental impact on ecological function than tree loss.

AB Harvest of Brazil nuts from the large, iconic tree Bertholletia excelsa generates substantial income for smallholders, providing a strong incentive to conserve the mature forests where it grows. Although much previous work has focused on the impact of nut harvest on new seedling recruits into B. excelsa populations, the connection between harvest rates and long-term population stability is still unclear. Moreover, there is additional uncertainty for Brazil nut management in terms of population response to climate change and other anthropogenic influences. We drew on 14 years of research in two sites in Acre, Brazil with different B. excelsa nut harvest intensities (39% and 81%), to produce stochastic and deterministic matrix population models which incorporated parameter uncertainty in vital rates. Adult abundance was projected to remain close to the current observed abundance or higher through the next 50 years. Elasticity analyses revealed that the asymptotic population growth rate (lambda) was most sensitive to stasis vital rates in sapling, juvenile, and adult stages. Deterministic transition matrices calculated using diameter growth rates dependent on rainfall yielded average values around 1.0 under extreme high, extreme low, and average annual rainfall. While sustained high rates of Brazil nut harvest and climate change could potentially negatively impact B. excelsa populations, changes in human use of the forested landscape are more immediate concern. To reduce the risk of population decline, smallholders and managers of B. excelsa rich forests should focus on conservation of pre-mature and mature individuals.

AB Light availability is an important modulator of seedling growth and plant-herbivore dynamics. Logging increases light levels in forests, potentially altering herbivore-plant interactions that drive seedling establishment. We conducted a transplant experiment to evaluate how logging and herbivory affect seedling growth and survival in three shade-tolerant tree species, at paired canopy gap and understory sites in logged forest and an adjacent unlogged area in central Amazonia (Brazil). Seedlings were either left exposed to naturally occurring insect herbivores or protected from insects by a fine netting structure. We measured the herbivore damage and growth rate of seedlings after 18 mo. In general, logged areas received more light than unlogged sites. Growth and herbivory rates were positively influenced by light, and herbivory was also influenced positively by logging. In gaps, increased growth mitigated foliar damage. Logging resulted in a loss of foliar tissue due to increased herbivory. Herbivory rates were higher in the understory of logged sites than in that of unlogged understory sites, but growth was similar in these areas. Thus, the understory of logged areas provided the least favorable sites for shade-tolerant tree regeneration, due to higher herbivory rates. The effect of logging on biotic interactions can extend beyond the gaps it creates into untouched understory sites. To our knowledge, this is the first time such a pattern has been observed, highlighting the importance of evaluating the impact of logging on biotic interactions.

AB Studies on the ecological impacts of non-timber forest products (NTFP) harvest reveal that plants are often more resilient to fruit and seed harvest than to bark and root harvest. Several studies indicate that sustainable fruit harvesting limits can be set very high (>80% fruit harvesting intensity). For species with clonal and sexual reproduction, understanding how fruit harvest affects clonal reproduction can shed light on the genetic risks and sustainability of NTFP harvest. We studied 18 populations of a gallery forest tree, Pentadesma butyracea (Clusiaceae), to test the impact of fruits harvest, climate and habitat size (gallery forest width) on the frequency of sexual or clonal recruitment in Benin, West Africa. We sampled populations in two ecological regions (Sudanian and Sudano-Guinean) and in each region, we selected sites with low, moderate and high fruit harvesting intensities. These populations were selected in gallery forests with varying width to sample the natural variation in P.butyracea habitat size. Heavily harvested populations produced significantly less seedlings but had the highest density and proportion of clonal offspring. Our study suggests that for plant species with dual reproductive strategy (via seeds and clonal), fruit harvesting and associated disturbances that come with it can lead to an increase in the proportion of clonal offspring. This raises the issue that excessive fruit harvest by increasing the proportion of clonal offspring to the detriment of seed originated offspring may lead to a reduction in genetic diversity with consequence on harvested species capability to withstand environmental stochasticity.

AB Hummingbirds are important pollinators of many native Neotropical plants but their abundance and diversity in landscapes dominated by intensive human uses such as agriculture have rarely been examined, despite such land-uses prevailing in the tropics. We examined how tropical deforestation affects hummingbird community structure in premontane forest patches embedded in a tropical countryside of Coto Brus Canton, Costa Rica. We captured hummingbirds in fourteen landscapes representing a gradient in patch size and forest amount, and tested for the effects of these variables on (1) hummingbird captures at flowers (pollinator availability); (2) species richness; and (3) filtering of functional traits. After accounting for sampling effects, both hummingbird availability and species richness declined by 40% and 50%, respectively, across the gradient in deforestation that we observed (9-66% forest within 1000m). Focal patch size was the strongest predictor, even after statistically accounting for the amount of forest and matrix composition of landscapes. These reductions in availability and richness were well predicted by functional traits; morphologically specialized species with the capacity to transport long-distance outcrossed pollen and low functional redundancy within the pollinator network showed the greatest sensitivity to landscape change. We hypothesize that declines in hummingbird availability, diversity, and functional traits are important mechanisms driving the observed pollen limitation of ornithophilous flowers in fragmented tropical landscapes. Efforts to conserve large forest patches and enhance matrix permeability are critical for maintaining forest hummingbird communities and pollination services under current and predicted deforestation regimes.

AB Megaherbivores are known to influence the structure, composition, and diversity of vegetation. In Central Africa, forest elephants act as ecological filters by breaking tree saplings and stripping them of foliage. Much less is known about impacts of megafauna on Southeast Asian rain forests. Here, we ask whether herbivory by Asian megafauna has impacts analogous to those of African forest elephants. To answer this, we studied forest (1) structure, (2) composition, (3) diversity, and (4) tree scars in Belum and Krau, two protected areas of Peninsular Malaysia, and compared the results with those obtained in African forests. Elephants are abundant in Belum but have been absent in Krau since 1993. We found that stem density and diversity, especially of tree saplings, were higher in Krau than in Belum. Palms and other monocots were also more abundant in Krau. In Belum, however, small monocots (<1 m tall) were very abundant but larger ones (>1 m tall) were virtually absent, suggesting size-selective removal. The frequency of stem-break scars was equal at Belum and Krau but less than in Central Africa and greater than in the Peruvian Amazon where tapirs are the only megafauna. Pigs and tapirs could also contribute to the high frequency of tree scars recorded in Malaysian forests. Forest-dwelling elephants in Asia seem to have a reduced impact on tree saplings compared to African forest elephants, but a very strong impact on monocots.

AB Ectoparasitism in bats seems to be influenced strongly by the type of roost preferred by the hosts, and group size; however, the effect of habitat loss and fragmentation on the prevalence of ectoparasites in bats has scarcely been studied. In northeastern Yucatan, Mexico, we estimated the prevalence of infestation by Streblidae flies in three phyllostomid bat species with different roost preferences (caves, trees, or both) in two types of landscape matrices (tropical semi-deciduous forest and man-made pastures) that differed in area of forest cover and the number of forest fragments. Habitat fragmentation and the presence of a contrasting matrix may limit the availability of roosts (trees) and the movement of bats across the landscape. Accordingly, we hypothesized higher prevalence of Streblidae infestation in the pasture matrix and in the group of bats that roost in trees. Bat abundance was higher in the pasture matrix; however, the prevalence of infestation was significantly higher in the continuous forest matrix and in bats that roosted in caves. The prevalence of some species of Streblidae was affected by habitat fragmentation in species that roost in caves, such as Desmodus rotundus, as well as those using foliage and caves, such as Artibeus jamaicensis. Our results provide evidence that some species of Streblidae may respond differently to habitat fragmentation than their hosts, generating changes to bat-ectoparasite interactions in fragmented areas. Environmental variations involving roosts, not evaluated in this study, may influence our results, since these factors affect ectoparasite abundance and reproduction.

AB Foraging theory predicts that generalist foragers should switch resources more readily, while specialist foragers should remain constant to preferred food resources. Plant-pollinator interactions provide a convenient system to test such predictions because floral resources are often temporally patchy, thus requiring long-lived pollinators to switch resources seasonally. Furthermore, flowering phenologies range from steady-state' (low-rewarding but highly reliable) to big-bang' (high-rewarding but ephemeral) plant species. We assessed how nectarivorous Old World bats respond to this temporally variable floral environment by examining their diets throughout the year. Over 15months of fieldwork in southern Thailand, we simultaneously: (1) recorded the flowering phenologies of six bat-pollinated plant taxa; and (2) assessed the diets of seven common flower-visiting bat species. As predicted, the generalist nectarivore (Eonycteris spelaea) frequently switched diets and utilized both big-bang and steady-state resources, while the specialist nectarivores (Macroglossus minimus and M.sobrinus) foraged on one or two steady-state plant species year-round. Our results suggest that larger and faster bat species are able to fly longer distances in search of big-bang resources, while smaller bat species rely on highly predictable food resources. This study supports the theory that generalist foragers have flexible diets, while specialist species restrict foraging to preferred floral resources even when other floral resources are more abundant. Moreover, these findings demonstrate how plant flowering phenology and pollinator diet breadth can shape the frequency and constancy of pollinator visits; we further discuss how such interactions can influence the potential extent of gene flow within a patchy floral environment.

AB Seed dispersers, like white-handed gibbons (Hylobates lar), can display wide inter-group variability in response to distribution and abundance of resources in their habitat. In different home ranges, they can modify their movement patterns along with the shape and scale of seed shadow produced. However, the effect of inter-group variability on the destination of dispersed seeds is still poorly explained. In this study, we evaluate how seed dispersal patterns of this arboreal territorial frugivore varies between two neighboring groups, one inhabiting high quality evergreen forest and one inhabiting low quality mosaic forest. We predicted a difference in seed dispersal distance between the two groups (longer in the poor quality forest). We hypothesized that this difference would be explained by differences in home range size, daily path length, and ranging tortuosity. After 6months of data collection, the evergreen group had a smaller home range (12.4 ha) than the mosaic group (20.9 ha), significantly longer daily path lengths (1507 m vs. 1114 m respectively) and greater tortuosity (39.1 vs. 16.1 respectively). Using gut passage times and displacement rates, we estimated the median seed dispersal distance as 163 m for the evergreen group (high quality forest) and of 116 m for the mosaic group (low quality forest). This contradiction with our initial prediction can be explained in term of social context, resource distribution, and habitat quality. Our results indicate that gibbons are dispersers of seeds between habitats and that dispersal distances provided by gibbons are influenced by a range of factors, including habitat and social context.

AB Past and ongoing vertebrate introductions threaten to rearrange ecological communities in the Indo-Malay Archipelago, one of Earth's most biodiverse regions. But the consequences of these translocations are difficult to predict. We compared local abundance and distributions in four tropical mammal lineages that have crossed from Asia to Wallacea or New Guinea. The local abundance of macaques (Macaca spp.), which naturally crossed Wallace's Line, was higher in Sulawesi (east of the line; mean = 3.7 individuals per camera station, 95% CI = 2.2: 5.1) than in Borneo (west of the line; mean=1.1, CI = 0.8: 1.4), but the local abundance of Malay civets (Viverra tangalunga), Rusa deer, and Sus pigs was similar in their native ranges and where they had been introduced by humans east of Wallace's Line. Proximity to rivers increased Malay Civet local abundance and decreased the local abundance of pigs in parts of their introduced ranges (Maluku and New Guinea, respectively), while having no effect on local abundance in their native ranges (Borneo) or other areas where they have been introduced (Sulawesi). That local abundance was higher east of Wallace's Line in just one of four mammal lineages is consistent with findings from plant invasions, where most species have similar abundance in their native and introduced ranges. However, species' ecology may change as they enter new communities, for example, their patterns of abundance at local scales. This could make it difficult to predict community structure in the face of ongoing species introductions.

AB Over 80% of Atlantic Forest remnants are <50ha and protected areas are embedded in a matrix dominated by human activities, undermining the long-term persistence of carnivores. The ocelot (Leopardus pardalis) is an opportunistic species, but little is known about its tolerance to habitat alterations and the influence of other species on its occupancy in Atlantic Forest remnants. We used camera traps to assess ocelot occupancy in protected areas of Atlantic Forest in southeastern Brazil. We found a positive correlation between the occupancy of ocelots and top predators (jaguars, Panthera onca, and pumas, Puma concolor), and a weaker negative effect between the number of domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) detected and ocelot occupancy. Ocelot detection was higher at sites with more eucalyptus, suggesting that ocelots frequently use these areas. Better-protected areas surrounded by permeable matrices may be critical to the persistence of ocelots in the fragmented Atlantic Forest.

AB Habitat conversion creates a mosaic of land cover types, which affect the spatial distribution, diversity, and abundance of resources. We used abundance, functional, and phylogenetic information to determine if Neotropical bat communities exhibited phylogenetic or functional overdispersion or underdispersion in response to habitat conversion. Overdispersion suggests the operation of intraclade competition, niche partitioning, limiting similarity, or character displacement, whereas underdispersion indicates the operation of interclade competition, abiotic filtering, or biotic filtering. We expected (1) biotic filtering in landscapes with extensive forest loss to result in underdispersion; (2) niche partitioning in heterogeneous landscapes with intermediate forest loss to result in overdispersion; and (3) intraclade competition during times of low resource abundance (i.e., dry season) to increase, resulting in overdispersion. Most bat communities exhibited phylogenetic or functional underdispersion; none exhibited overdispersion. Expectations were not met: underdispersion did not increase with forest loss, heterogeneous landscapes did not induce overdispersion, and no evidence supported the contention that intraclade competition changed with season. Empirical responses were season-specific, likely because resource availability may affect relationships between forest cover and underdispersion and between biodiversity and underdispersion. During the dry season, only high diversity sites exhibited underdispersion (i.e., functional or phylogenetic redundancy), whereas underdispersion occurred in low, intermediate, or high diversity communities during the wet season; we suggest that this difference likely arises due to changes in resource abundance. Communities with high diversity and redundancy occupied heterogeneous sites during the dry season, but communities with high redundancy were restricted to large forest reserves during the wet season.

AB In Monteverde, Costa Rica, the vulnerable Three-wattled Bellbird (Procnias tricarunculatus) feeds primarily upon the fruit of Lauraceae species during its reproductive and post-reproductive seasons. To understand and advance appropriate conservation measures, this study identified the bellbird's foraging challenges in its search for a temporally and spatially fluctuating resource. Although there are at least 96 species of Lauraceae found in the five life zones of Monteverde, the distinct distributions of tree species both among and within life zones require the bellbirds to track seasonal fruiting across the various zones. In this 6-year study, we monitored the fruiting of tree species and bellbird abundance in 24 study plots within its post-reproductive life zone, the Premontane Wet forest, to identify preferred bellbird food resources and how the fruiting of these species drives the spatial distribution of the bellbird. Our research revealed phenological patterns of annual, biennial, and triennial fruiting with high levels of fruiting synchrony within several identified key fruit species. Of critical conservation importance is that no single species of Lauraceae produced a consistent food supply for bellbirds each year. Therefore, even within life zones, the bellbird's survival depends on its mobility to search for and obtain fruit, as well as the availability of fruits of multiple tree species. The conservation implications include focused attention on multiple core areas within given life zones, protection of existing forest and remnant trees, and forest restoration with plantings of multiple tree species. We suspect that other tropical frugivorous species face similar conservation challenges.

AB Understanding diet variation is a major concern when developing conservation guidelines for threatened species, especially for marine predators whose prey availability can be reduced by commercial fisheries. Diet can vary in geographically structured populations due to variation in prey availability and within a location due to the effects of season, sex, age, and individual. However, these sources of variation are seldom considered together in dietary studies. We analyzed diet variation at the geographical and intrapopulation levels in the franciscana dolphin (Pontoporia blainvillei) by analyzing samples of stomach contents from individuals incidentally caught by artisanal fisheries. We investigated the geographical (Northern, Central, and Southern regions of the SAo Paulo State coast, Brazil) and intrapopulation effects of season, sex, and age. We used the leave-one-out cross-validation method to test for significance of the proportional similarity index, which measures the overlap between diet compositions. We found that diet varied across different levels, from the geographical to the individual level, including the effects of season, sex, and age. Diet variation as a function of age suggests an ontogenetic diet shift. Our findings indicate that ecological processes within local stocks should inform management at the local geographic scale. Evidence for ecological differences between franciscana stocks is of great significance for the conservation of this threatened species.

AB Endozoochory is a prominent form of seed dispersal in tropical dry forests. Most extant megafauna that perform such seed dispersal are ungulates, which can also be seed predators. White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) is one of the last extant megafauna of Neotropical dry forests, but whether it serves as a legitimate seed disperser is poorly understood. We studied seed dispersal patterns and germination after white-tailed deer gut passage in a tropical dry forest in southwest Ecuador. Over 23 mo, we recorded ca 2000 seeds of 11 species in 385 fecal samples. Most seeds belonged to four species of Fabaceae: Chloroleucon mangense, Senna mollissima, Piptadenia flava, and Caesalpinia glabrata. Seeds from eight of the 11 species dispersed by white-tailed deer germinated under controlled conditions. Ingestion did not affect germination of C. mangense and S.mollissima, whereas C. glabrata showed reduced germination. Nevertheless, the removal of fruit pulp resulting from ingestion by white-tailed deer could have a deinhibition effect on germination due to seed release. Thus, white-tailed deer play an important role as legitimate seed dispersers of woody species formerly considered autochorous. Our results suggest that more research is needed to fully understand the ecological and evolutionary effects of the remaining extant megafauna on plant regeneration dynamics in the dry Neotropics.

AB Molecular genetics research can benefit efforts to conserve the genetic diversity of tropical plant species. Clear and efficient procedures are needed to access DNA samples, while respecting tropical countries' and local communities' rights on genetic resource usage. The Nagoya Protocol on Access and Benefit-Sharing, which took effect in 2014, provides an opportunity to establish such procedures. However, scientists are concerned that its emphasis on monetary gains restricts research focused on scientific, societal, and environmental benefits. Despite much political and scientific debate, few concrete cases have demonstrated the practical functioning of the Nagoya Protocol. This paper describes the first application of the Protocol in Guatemala, where it was used to grant permission to a non-commercial study on gene flow in mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla King) populations in the Maya Biosphere Reserve of Peten. On the basis of this study, we discuss five strategies to enhance the application of molecular genetics to conservation biology under the Nagoya Protocol: (1) generate short and standardized procedures; (2) enable science communication; (3) cultivate a common understanding between users, providers, and potential beneficiaries; (4) involve local research and practitioner organizations; and (5) integrate participatory research. Positive societal views on the application of molecular genetics to conservation biology generate further support for work in this discipline and promote adoption of research results for the conservation of genetic diversity of tropical plant species.

AB Road widening (a.k.a. road dualling) and the presence of mitigation structures may have opposing effects on the number of animal-vehicle collisions. Their influence in tropical areas is poorly quantified, and we know little about how modifications of road structure affect fauna roadkill and mitigation. We evaluated how road widening and proximity to a wildlife underpass affect roadkill of medium and large mammals, using roadkill records from before and after the widening of 150 km of road with new and old wildlife underpasses. Roadkilled species were divided into three groups based on mobility and sensitivity to human disturbance. Four of 16 species exhibited significantly higher roadkill after widening. Roadkill near underpasses was generally higher than by chance, despite our expectation of reduction in roadkills. This result indicates that we must adopt more effective mitigation measures, such as appropriate fencing combined with underpasses.

Our study on the in situ germination of two Tillandsia species in a deciduous forest in Yucatan, Mexico showed an average post-dispersal seed predation rate by the Yucatan deer mouse (Peromyscus yucatanicus) of 90%. Post-dispersal predation was thus more limiting than drought.

AB Savanna tree species vary in the magnitude of their response to grass competition, but the functional traits that explain this variation remain largely unknown. To address this gap, we grew seedlings of 10 savanna tree species with and without grasses in a controlled greenhouse experiment. We found strong interspecific differences in tree competitive response, which was positively related to photosynthesis rates, suggesting a trade-off between the ability to grow well under conditions of low and high grass biomass across tree species. We also found no competitive effect of tree seedlings on grass, suggesting strong tree-grass competitive asymmetry. Our results identify a potentially important trade-off that enhances our ability to predict how savanna tree communities might respond to variation in grass competition.

AB The diversity and abundance of gall-inducing organisms are directly proportional to the structural complexity of the host plant. This hypothesis is controversial for forest environments, such as mangroves. Avicennia germinans (L.), a principal mangrove tree species found in the Neotropical region, is considered to be a superhost for gall-inducing insects. Using a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) based on the analysis of 1000 apical branches from 50 A. germinans trees, we examined the diversity and abundance of gall morphotypes (GM), together with the structural attributes of replanted 5- to 9-year-old mangroves, in the Amazon coast of Brazil. A total of 7602 galls were registered, averaging 1.3 +/- 0.4 galls per leaf. Sixteen of the 22 morphotypes identified were found at all study sites. Two gall morphotypes (GM7 and GM4) were the most abundant, representing approximately 40 percent of the total. The structural complexity of the plant (mainly based on the number of leaves) directly affected the abundance and diversity of these organisms. While A. germinans is a superhost, this type of parasitism did not affect plant development or survival. The ample distribution of A. germinans, the formation of monospecific forests, and the high palatability of this plant make it an essential resource for the survival of the gall-inducing guild in the mangroves of the Neotropics.

AB Embryos of oviparous organisms must cope with harsh environments and are especially susceptible to disease, considering that many immune mechanisms do not develop until later in life. Parents may transmit symbiotic microflora to eggs, which can contribute to embryo immune defense. Despite the importance of symbiotic microbes for immune function and survival of adult amphibians, vertical transfer of symbionts in amphibians has received less attention than in other taxa. Here, we test the role of male-only parental care in establishing and maintaining the diversity of egg-bacterial assemblages in a Neotropical glassfrog (Centrolenidae). Previous research suggests that father Hyalinobatrachium colymbiphyllum may transfer bacterial symbionts to their eggs. We combined a male-removal experiment in situ with 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to determine whether egg attendance by father H. colymbiphyllum influences the bacterial community and survival of eggs. We found that eggs harbor a diverse and stable bacterial assemblage. Despite different host environments, we found that adult skin and eggs supported very similar bacterial assemblages-even after removing fathers. While we found overlap in the bacteria present on eggs and their fathers, our experiment reveals that extended male care does not contribute to the maintenance of egg-bacterial communities, so there may be other potential routes of transfer. This study contributes to our understanding of the diversity and maintenance of egg microbiomes, and motivates further research on how initial bacteria are acquired and the ontogenetic development of host-symbiont communities.

AB Geographic isolation is the first step in insect herbivore diet specialization. Such specialization is postulated to increase insect fitness, but may simultaneously reduce insect ability to colonize novel hosts. During the Paleocene-Eocene, plants from the order Zingiberales became isolated either in the Paleotropics or in the Neotropics. During the Cretaceous, rolled-leaf beetles diversified in the Neotropics concurrently with Neotropical Zingiberales. Using a community of Costa Rican rolled-leaf beetles and their Zingiberales host plants as study system, we explored if previous geographic isolation precludes insects to expand their diets to exotic hosts. We recorded interactions between rolled-leaf beetles and native Zingiberales by combining DNA barcodes and field records for 7450 beetles feeding on 3202 host plants. To determine phylogenetic patterns of diet expansions, we established 20 experimental plots in the field, in which we planted plots five exotic Zingiberales, recording beetles feeding on these exotic hosts. In the laboratory, using both native and exotic host plants, we reared a subset of insect species that had expanded their diets to the exotic plants. The original plant-herbivore community comprised 24 beetle species feeding on 35 native hosts, representing 103 plant-herbivore interactions. After exotic host plant introduction, 20 percent of the beetle species expanded their diets to exotic Zingiberales. Insects only established on exotic hosts that belong to the same plant family as their native hosts. Laboratory experiments show that beetles are able to complete development on these novel hosts. In conclusion, rolled-leaf beetles are preadapted to expand their diets to novel host plants even after millions of years of geographic isolation.

AB Habitat loss and fragmentation affect the structure and functioning of forested ecosystems worldwide, yet we lack an understanding of how species respond to environmental changes. Here, we examined reproductive success and seedling performance of Poulsenia armata (Moraceae) in continuous and fragmented forests of Los Tuxtlas, southern Mexico. We further investigated how maternal habitat and soil conditions manifested in the seedling stage. We determined seed quality and seedling performance by combining isotopic analyses in seed quality with field observations of P. armata fruit production and a common-garden experiment. Soil conditions in forest fragments negatively impacted P. armata reproductive success. Trees of P. armata in forest fragments were smaller in size and produced fewer fruits and smaller seeds with lower quality compared with trees from the continuous forest. The combined effects of maternal habitat and soil conditions determined seedling survival and growth of this tropical tree. Notably, seedlings had restricted plasticity for biomass allocation to roots, limiting the capacity of fragmented populations to compensate for the initial low N content in seeds. Trees in forest fragments at Los Tuxtlas produced offspring competitively inferior and potentially less resilient than counterparts in continuous forest, jeopardizing future persistence of this late-successional tree species.

AB Ecuador has some of the greatest biodiversity in the world, sheltering global biodiversity hotspots in lowland and mountain regions. Climate change will likely have a major effect on these regions, but the consequences for faunal diversity and conservation remain unclear. To address this issue, we used an ensemble of eight species distribution models to predict future shifts and identify areas of high changes in species richness and species turnover for 201 mammals. We projected the distributions using two different climate change scenarios at the 2050 horizon and contrasted two extreme dispersal scenarios (no dispersal vs. full dispersal). Our results showed extended distributional shifts all over the country. For most groups, our results predicted that the current diversity of mammals in Ecuador would decrease significantly under all climate change scenarios and dispersal assumptions. The Northern Andes and the Amazonian region would remain diversity hotspots but with a significant decrease in the number of species. All predictions, including the most conservative scenarios in terms of dispersal and climate change, predicted major changes in the distribution of mammalian species diversity in Ecuador. Primates might be the most severely affected because they would have fewer suitable areas, compared with other mammals. Our work emphasizes the need for sound conservation strategies in Ecuador to mitigate the effects of climate change

AB According to apparent competition theory, the co-occurrence of two species that share the same predators appears to affect each other's population growth and abundance. However, due to habitat loss and over-hunting, top predators are being made rare worldwide. Considering that apparent competitors share similar resources, we would expect the absence of top predators to reflect in changes on prey realized trophic niches. To test our hypothesis, we developed a model to predict the abundance ratio of apparent competitor species based on changes in their realized trophic niches. We tested our model against field data on the Neotropical marsupials Didelphis aurita and Metachirus nudicaudatus. Our results revealed that D. aurita and M. nudicaudatus are two species under apparent competition and their realized trophic niche and diet overlap change according to the presence of top predators. The model was able to predict the actual relative abundances of D. aurita and M. nudicaudatus in the three empirical studies analyzed. Our study presents quantitative support to the apparent competition theory; however, the model's applications to other groups still need to be verified. Additionally, our study shows that the lack of top predators has consequences on the realized trophic niche of their prey, and therefore, we reinforce that conservation plans need to focus on the effects of top predator loss on ecosystems.

AB Large-bodied frugivorous birds play an important role in dispersing large-sized seeds in Neotropical rain forests, thereby maintaining tree species richness and diversity. Conversion of contiguous forest land to forest fragments is thought to be driving population declines in large-bodied frugivores, but the mechanistic drivers of this decline remain poorly understood. To assess the importance of fragment-level versus local landscape attributes in influencing the species richness of large-bodied (>100 g) frugivorous birds, we surveyed 15 focal species in 22 forest fragments (2.7 to 33.6 ha, avg. = 16.0 ha) in northwest Ecuador in 2014. Fragment habitat variables included density of large trees, canopy openness and height, and fragment size; landscape variables included elevation and the proportion of tree cover within a 1 km radius of each fragment. At both the individual species level, and across the community of 12 species of avian frugivore we detected, there was higher richness and probability of presence in fragments with more tree cover on surrounding land. This tendency was particularly pronounced among some endangered species. These findings corroborate the idea that partially forested land surrounding fragments may effectively increase the suitable habitat for forest-dwelling frugivorous birds in fragmented landscapes. These results can help guide conservation priorities within fragmented landscapes, with particular reference to retaining trees and reforesting to attain high levels of tree cover in areas between forest patches.

AB Effective vegetation classification schemes identify the processes determining species assemblages and support the management of protected areas. They can also provide a framework for ecological research. In the tropics, elevation-based classifications dominate over alternatives such as river catchments. Given the existence of floristic data for many localities, we ask how useful floristic data are for developing classification schemes in species-rich tropical landscapes and whether floristic data provide support for classification by river catchment. We analyzed the distribution of vascular plant species within 141 plots across an elevation gradient of 130 to 3200 m asl within La Amistad National Park. We tested the hypothesis that river catchment, combined with elevation, explains much of the variation in species composition. We found that annual mean temperature, elevation, and river catchment variables best explained the variation within local species communities. However, only plots in high-elevation oak forest and Paramo were distinct from those in lowand mid-elevation zones. Beta diversity did not significantly differ in plots grouped by elevation zones, except for low-elevation forest, although it did differ between river catchments. None of the analyses identified discrete vegetation assemblages within mid-elevation (700-2600 m asl) plots. Our analysis supports the hypothesis that river catchment can be an alternative means for classifying tropical forest assemblages in conservation settings.

AB Termites are major decomposers in tropical regions and play critical roles in many soil-related processes. Studies conducted in Asia and the Neotropics suggest that habitat modification can strongly affect termite assemblages, but data on termite communities from forests in Africa, especially West Africa, are scarce. Here, we measured the short-term impact of slash-and-burn agriculture on termite assemblages in an agricultural region of central Cote d'Ivoire. We assessed termite diversity and relative abundance in four habitat types: secondary forest, cleared forest, burned forest, and crop fields. The secondary forest had higher species richness compared with the other habitats, but all habitat types had similar assemblage structures. Fungus-growing termites were the most abundant feeding group in all habitats. Soil feeders were most abundant in secondary forest, intermediately abundant in cleared and burned forests, and almost entirely absent in crop fields. Wood-feeding species showed clear responses to burning; their abundances decreased after fire. We conclude that slash-and-burn agriculture does not appear to severely erode the diversity of termite assemblages. This could be due to the dominance of ecologically versatile fungus growers or to the relatively long time between clearing and burning. However, forest clearing negatively affects soil feeders, with the Apicotermitinae most affected by canopy loss.

AB Transplant studies can provide valuable information on the growth responses of epiphytic bryophytes and lichens to environmental factors. We studied the growth of six epiphyte species at three sites in moist Afromontane forests of Taita Hills, Kenya. With 558 pendant transplants, we documented the growth of four bryophytes and two lichens over 1 yr. The transplants were placed into the lower canopy of one forest site in an upper montane zone, and two forest sites in a lower montane zone. Several pendant moss species grew very well in the cool and humid environment of the upper montane forest, with some transplants more than doubling their biomass during the year. Conversely, all transplanted taxa performed poorly in the lower montane zone, presumably because of the unfavorable combination of ample moisture with excessive warmth and insufficient light which characterizes the lower canopy in dense lower montane forests. The results demonstrate that pendant transplants can be used for monitoring growth of non-vascular epiphytes in tropical forests. The starting weight of 0.25 g for pendant transplants worked well and can be recommended for future studies.

AB Pre-dispersal seed predation can greatly reduce crop size affecting recruitment success. In addition, non-fatal damage by seed predators may allow infection by fungi responsible for post-dispersal seed losses. The objectives of this study were (1) to quantify pre-dispersal seed predation and fungal infection in a Neotropical tree species, Luehea seemannii, that produces dehiscent fruits and wind-dispersed seeds, and (2) to link pre-dispersal effects on seed quality to seed survival in the soil. To examine how seed predators and fungi influence seed losses, mesh exclosures, fungicide, and the combination of both treatments were applied to separate branches in the canopy of trees in Gamboa and Parque Natural Metropolitano (PNM), Panama. To determine if treatments affect seed viability and survival in the soil, half of the seeds collected from each treatment were buried for 4 weeks in forest soils and subsequently allowed to germinate before and after the breaking of dormancy. Overall, 24 percent of developing fruit were lost to insect attack. In contrast, fungi infected only 3 percent of seeds at the pre-dispersal stage. For seeds germinated directly after collection, fungicide significantly increased germination in the wetter site (Gamboa) but decreased germination in the drier site (PNM). The pre-dispersal insect exclosure treatment increased the fraction of seeds that remained dormant after burial in the soil. This result suggests that exposure to insect predators may cause physical damage to seeds that results in the loss of physical dormancy but does not necessarily increase the susceptibility of seeds to pathogen attack in the soil.

AB Understanding the consequences of habitat modification on wildlife communities is central to the development of conservation strategies. However, albeit male and female individuals of numerous species are known to exhibit differences in habitat use, sex-specific responses to habitat modification remain little explored. Here, we used a landscape-scale fragmentation experiment to assess, separately for males and females, the effects of fragmentation on the abundance of Carollia perspicillata and Rhinophylla pumilio, two widespread Neotropical frugivorous bats. We predicted that sex-specific responses would arise from higher energetic requirements from pregnancy and lactation in females. Analyses were conducted independently for each season, and we further investigated the joint responses to local and landscape-scale metrics of habitat quality, composition, and configuration. Although males and females responded similarly to a fragmentation gradient composed by continuous forest, fragment interiors, edges, and matrix habitats, we found marked differences between sexes in habitat use for at least one of the seasons. Whereas the sex ratio varied little in continuous forest and fragment interiors, females were found to be more abundant than males in edge and matrix habitats. This difference was more prominent in the dry season, the reproductive season of both species. For both species, abundance responses to local-and landscape-scale predictors differed between sexes and again, differences were more pronounced in the dry season. The results suggest considerable sex-mediated responses to forest disruption and degradation in tropical bats and complement our understanding of the impacts of fragmentation on tropical forest vertebrate communities.

AB Terrestrial species of the megadiverse bromeliad family display a wide variety of leaf shapes, many of which have evolved convergently in different lineages. Here, I examine the links between leaf shape, venation architecture, hydraulic function, and bioclimatic relations in two bromeliad groups displaying diverse leaf shapes, the genus Pitcairnia (Pitcairnioideae) and the terrestrial grade of the Bromelioideae subfamily. Leaf shapes with broader leaf blades, notably petiolate and lanceolate morphologies, tend to show wider vein spacing, which is associated with reduced hydraulic capacity and higher hydraulic vulnerability. In turn, these leaf shapes tend to occur in species restricted to moist, aseasonal environments, suggesting that hydraulic function is an important mediator of the relationship between leaf shape and bromeliad environmental niches. This network of trait-trait and trait-environment relationships may have been of profound important in the ecological and evolutionary diversification of the bromeliads. Similar structure-function principles are likely to apply in other tropical herbaceous monocots, which are of great ecological importance but generally neglected in plant hydraulic research.

AB Disturbance can alter tree species and functional diversity in tropical forests, which in turn could affect carbon and nutrient cycling via the decomposition of plant litter. However, the influence of tropical tree diversity on forest floor organisms and the processes they mediate are far from clear. We investigated the influence of different litter mixtures on arthropod communities and decomposition processes in a 60-year-old lowland tropical forest in Panama, Central America. We used litter mixtures representing pioneer and old growth tree species in experimental mesocosms to assess the links between litter types, decomposition rates, and litter arthropod communities. Overall, pioneer species litter decomposed most rapidly and old growth species litter decomposed the slowest but there were clear nonadditive effects of litter mixtures containing both functional groups. We observed distinct arthropod communities in different litter mixtures at 6 mo, with greater arthropod diversity and abundance in litter from old growth forest species. By comparing the decay of different litter mixtures in mesocosms and conventional litterbags, we demonstrated that our mesocosms represent an effective approach to link studies of litter decomposition and arthropod communities. Our results indicate that changes in the functional diversity of litter could have wider implications for arthropod communities and ecosystem functioning in tropical forests.

AB The association between the reproductive phenology of epiphytic communities with environmental and ecological factors remains largely unexplored. Because epiphytes depend on environmental moisture, seasonal changes in moisture conditions likely act as the primary determinants of their reproductive timing. We examined whether water limitation or pollinator competition structures the flowering phenologies of an epiphytic community in a seasonal mountain forest in Costa Rica. Additionally, we addressed the environmental factors that might trigger floral induction. Using a 24-month dataset of bimonthly flowering records from 104 species, we found high seasonality of flowering at the species level but somewhat lower seasonality at the community level. The flowering mid-dates of most epiphytes, particularly from monocotyledonous species, occurred during the wettest months, as predicted if water limitation structures flowering. The increased moisture and nutrient availability during the rainy season give epiphytes the resources needed to complete floral development and anthesis, and later fruit and seed maturation. The observed flowering pattern of epiphytes coincides with reproductive patterns of terrestrial herbs and shrubs from seasonal tropical ecosystems, and suggests shared constraints to sexual reproduction in both ecological guilds under similar climatic conditions. In contrast, flowering patterns of congeneric epiphytes in the same pollination guild mostly did not follow the expectations of a pollinator competition scenario. Finally, we discuss the possible combined effect of precipitation, temperature, and daily insolation on floral induction of epiphytic plants.

AB Herbivorous animals face shortages of different minerals in different geographic areas. In the Amazon Basin, sodium is often limiting, driving herbivores to seek supplemental sources. In the lowlands of the western Amazon Basin, parrots commonly consume sodium-rich soils at clay licks but lick use varies widely among species, and to date, parrots in the region have not been reported consuming other supplemental sodium sources. We document 11 species of psittacines consuming sodium-rich leaves and trunks of Attalea butyracea palms growing on sodium-rich soils in lowland Peru. Consumed palms had more sodium and less potassium than uneaten A. butyracea palms and other palm species in the area. Among A. butyracea palm parts, sodium and Na:K ratios were highest in trunks (consumed by parrots in 94% of the 387 foraging bouts recorded) and lowest in leaves (consumed in only 14% of foraging bouts). The low potassium and high Na:K ratio suggest that birds may be seeking not just any sodium sources, but those low in potassium, as potassium is known to exacerbate dietary sodium shortages. Use of the palms and species' abundance in the study area were not correlated. Instead, parrot species that consumed palms the most were those that use relatively few traditional soil clay licks. This finding suggests that parrot species in the region have fundamental differences in preferred strategies for obtaining supplemental sodium and may help explain documented interspecific differences in geophagy.

AB Extrafloral nectar provision during floral ontogeny in ant-plants has not been widely studied. Extrafloral nectar secretion differed between leaves associated with buds, flowers, and fruits, and peaked during anthesis when pollinators were present. This ontogenetic variation may result from mixed selective pressures involving strategies for defense and mutualist management.
   Resumen La variacion en el nectar extrafloral a lo largo del desarrollo floral de plantas mirmecofilas ha sido poco estudiado. La secrecion de nectar extrafloral difirio fuertemente entre hojas asociadas a botones, flores y frutos. El pico de produccion se presenta durante la antesis, cuando visitan los polinizadores. Esta variacion ontogenetica puede ser producto de varias presiones selectivas relacionadas con estrategias de defensa y de manejo de mutualistas.

AB Plant-pollinator interactions are critical to ecosystems. However, when artificial nectar feeders are available in an area, they could draw pollinators away from plants. We tested the effects of artificial nectar feeders in an Ecuadorian cloud forest on four aspects of bat-plant interactions: (1) bat relative abundance; (2) bat pollen loads; (3) flower visitation rates, and (4) breeding success of a bat-pollinated species (Burmeistera glabrata). We divided the study site into areas close to (similar to 30m) and far from (similar to 500m) three different feeder sites. At each distance, we captured nectar bats (Anoura caudifer, Anoura cultrata, and Lonchophylla robusta) to estimate their relative abundance and to collect pollen from fur and fecal samples. We also videotaped flowers to estimate bat visitation rates and recorded different breeding success variables of B.glabrata. We found that areas close to feeders have higher relative bat abundance by a factor of 40. In spite of this, the presence of feeders did not affect bat pollen loads, nor the flower visitation rates and breeding success of B.glabrata. Interestingly, there were differences in pollen loads between the three bat species, in that L.robusta individuals rarely carried pollen and were only captured near feeders.
   Resumen Las interacciones planta-polinizador son muy importantes para los ecosistema. Sin embargo, dichas interacciones puede alterarse si bebederos artificiales de nectar se encuentran presentes en el area y alejan a los murcielagos de las plantas. Este estudio evaluo los efectos de los bebederos artificiales de nectar en un bosque montano ecuatoriano, sobre cuatro aspectos de las interacciones planta-murcielago: (1) abundancia relativa de murcielagos; (2) cargas de polen en murcielagos; (3) tasa de visitacion a flores y (4) exito reproductivo de la especie polinizada por murcielagos Burmeistera glabrata. Dividimos el lugar de estudio en zonas cercanas (similar to 30m) y lejanas (similar to 500m) a tres areas de bebederos. En cada zona capturamos murcielagos nectarivoros (Anoura caudifer, Anoura cultrata and Lonchophylla robusta) empleando redes de neblina para estimar su abundancia relativa y colectar muestras de polen del pelaje y muestras fecales, en dichas muestras registramos frecuencia, abundancia y diversidad de polen. Tambien, filmamos flores para estimar la tasa de visitacion de murcielagos, y registramos variables del exito reproductivo de B. glabrata. Encontramos una abundancia relativa de murcielagos 40 veces mas alta en zonas cercanas que lejanas a los bebederos. A pesar de esto, la presencia de bebederos no afecto las cargas de polen, la tasa de visitacion a flores o el exito reproductivo de B. glabrata. Curiosamente, encontramos diferencias en las cargas de polen entre especies de murcielagos capturadas cerca a los bebederos, particularmente, individuos de L. robusta raramente llevaban polen en el pelaje y solo fueron capturados en zonas cercanas a los bebederos.

AB Impacts of climate change require that society urgently develops ways to reduce amounts of carbon in the atmosphere. Tropical forests present an important opportunity, as they take up and store large amounts of carbon. It is often suggested that forests with high biodiversity have large stocks and high rates of carbon uptake. Evidence is, however, scattered across geographic areas and scales, and it remains unclear whether biodiversity is just a co-benefit or also a requirement for the maintenance of carbon stocks and uptake. Here, we perform a quantitative review of empirical studies that analyzed the relationships between plant biodiversity attributes and carbon stocks and carbon uptake in tropical forests. Our results show that biodiversity attributes related to species, traits or structure significantly affect carbon stocks or uptake in 64% of the evaluated relationships. Average vegetation attributes (community-mean traits and structural attributes) are more important for carbon stocks, whereas variability in vegetation attributes (i.e., taxonomic diversity) is important for both carbon stocks and uptake. Thus, different attributes of biodiversity have complementary effects on carbon stocks and uptake. These biodiversity effects tend to be more often significant in mature forests at broad spatial scales than in disturbed forests at local spatial scales. Biodiversity effects are also more often significant when confounding variables are not included in the analyses, highlighting the importance of performing a comprehensive analysis that adequately accounts for environmental drivers. In summary, biodiversity is not only a co-benefit, but also a requirement for short- and long-term maintenance of carbon stocks and enhancement of uptake. Climate change policies should therefore include the maintenance of multiple attributes of biodiversity as an essential requirement to achieve long-term climate change mitigation goals.

AB The fields of tropical biology and conservation face significant transformations due to rapid technological developments in remote sensing. Other fields (e.g. Archeology) are experiencing this momentous change even more rapidly. In this article, we review some of the challenges that the fields of tropical biology and conservation face during the first quarter of the twenty-first century from the perspective of various remote sensing technologies, and discuss the transformations that they may bring to these disciplines. In addition, we review two emerging technologies driving paradigm changes in the nexus of ecology, remote sensing, and analytics: near-surface remote sensing and Wireless Sensor Networks. These two technologies, arising from the eScience paradigm, offer unique opportunities to integrate field observations at hyper-temporal and spatial resolutions that were not possible as recently as 5years ago.

AB Road networks are expanding in tropical countries, increasing human access to remote forests that act as refuges for biodiversity and provide globally important ecosystem services. Logging is one of the main drivers of road construction in tropical forests. We evaluated forest fragmentation and impacts of logging roads on forest resilience and wildlife, considering the full life cycle of logging roads. Through an extensive evidence review we found that for logging road construction, corridors between 3 and 66m (median 20m) width are cleared, leading to a loss of 0.6-8.0 percent (median 1.7%) of forest cover. More severe impacts are increased fire incidence, soil erosion, landslides, and sediment accumulation in streams. Once opened, logging roads potentially allow continued access to the forest interior, which can lead to biological invasions, increased hunting pressure, and proliferation of swidden agriculture. Some roads, initially built for logging, become converted to permanent, public roads with subsequent in-migration and conversion of forest to agriculture. Most logging roads, however, are abandoned to vegetation recovery. Given the far-reaching impacts of the roads that become conduits for human access, its control after the end of logging operations is crucial. Strategic landscape planning should design road networks that concentrate efficient forest exploitation and conserve roadless areas.

AB It is well known that bird richness in the Amazon is greater in upland forests and that seasonally flooded forest is particularly species poor. However, the misleading pattern of greater bird richness in seasonally flooded forest has emerged seemingly unnoticed numerous times in richness maps in the literature. We hypothesize that commission errors in digital distribution maps (DDMs) are the cause behind the misleading richness pattern. In the Amazon, commission errors are a consequence of the different methodological treatment given to large-ranged versus small-ranged habitat specialists when mapping distributions. DDMs of 1007 Amazonian birds were examined, and maps that had commission errors were corrected. We generated two richness maps, one from the overlay of original DDMs and another from the overlay of the corrected ones. We identified 291 species whose distribution maps had errors. In the original data, seasonally flooded forests showed higher species richness than upland forest, but this pattern was reverted in the corrected richness map. Commission errors were 35 times more likely in the seasonally flooded forest. We conclude that DDMs accurately portray the distribution of single species in the Amazon. Commission errors in individual maps, however, accumulate when they are overlaid, explaining the misleading pattern for birds in the Amazon. DDMs can continue to be used mapping richness, as long as, at a regional scale: (1) basic map refinements are carried, or (2) only small-range species are used for mapping species richness.
   Resumo Esta bem estabelecido que a riqueza de aves na Amazonia e maior em floresta de terra firme e que as varzeas sAo comparativamente pobres em especies. No entanto, o padrAo equivocado de maior riqueza em floresta de varzea surgiu, aparentemente despercebido, inumeras vezes em mapas de riqueza na literatura. Propomos que erros de comissAo em mapas digitais de distribuicAo (MDDs) estAo por tras padrAo equivocado de maior riqueza. Na Amazonia, erros de comissAo sAo a consequencia de diferentes tratamentos metodologicos usados para especies de distribuicAo ampla versus especies especialistas de distribuicAo restrita na confeccAo dos mapas. Os erros de comissAo nos MDD de 1.007 aves que ocorrem na Amazonia foram examinados e os mapas com erros foram corrigidos. Geramos dois mapas de riqueza, um a partir da sobreposicAo dos MDD originais e o outro da sobreposicAo dos mapas corrigidos. Identificamos 291 especies cujos mapas de distribuicAo apresentavam erros de comissAo. No mapa original, as varzeas apresentaram maior riqueza de especies que floresta de terra firme, mas esse padrAo foi invertido no mapa de riqueza corrigido. Os erros de comissAo foram 35 vezes maiores em varzea. Concluimos que os MDDs representam corretamente a distribuicAo de especies individuais na Amazonia. Erros de comissAo em mapas individuais, no entanto, acumulam quando estes sAo sobrepostos, explicando o padrAo equivocado para aves na Amazonia. MDDs podem continuar sendo usados para mapear a riqueza, contanto que, em escala regional (1) um refinamento basico seja conduzido, ou (2) apenas especies de distribuicAo restrita sejam utilizadas.

AB Worldwide, fungal richness peaks in tropical forest biomes where they are the primary drivers of decomposition. Understanding how environmental and anthropogenic factors influence tropical macrofungal fruiting patterns should provide insight as to how, for example, climate change and deforestation may impact their long-term demographic stability and evolutionary potential. However, in Amazonia no studies have yet to disentangle the effects of substrate, seasonality and forest history on phenology. Here, we quantitate spatial and temporal variation in community structure of fruiting macrofungi in relation to these factors at a long-term forest management research site in central Amazonia: the Biomass and Nutrients of Tropical Rain Forest (BIONTE's). Basidiome surveys of four substrate classes (leaves, soil, branches and trunks) were conducted along 250m(2) transects in primary and secondary (managed) forests, between 2012-13. From the 669 basidiomes collected, 290 taxa were identified of which 44 percent were restricted to primary and 36 percent to secondary forests. Although species-accumulation curves did not asymptote, rarefaction analyses and Fisher's alpha indicate contrasting differences in richness among forests in relation to substrate type. For example, leaf litter basidiome richness was higher in secondary forests, whereas the contrary was observed for soil communities, suggesting that variation in fruiting patterns in relation to disturbance is substrate-dependent possibly due to differences in necromass quality and/or understory micro-climates. Furthermore, secondary forests harbored significantly lower basidiome richness and abundance in dry months, suggesting synergistic impacts of seasonality and management history on fruiting regimes.
   Resumo As florestas tropicais abrigam grande diversidade de fungos, e estes por sua vez sAo responsaveis pela ciclagem de grande parte da materia organica produzida nesses biomas. Diante dessa importancia, e relevante entender como os fatores ambientais e antropogenicos influenciam o surgimento e distribuicAo dos fungos, ainda que local, por meio de informacoes de como mudancas climaticas e o desflorestamento poderiam impactar essas comunidades em longo prazo. O objetivo deste trabalho foi comparar, em escala local, a diversidade de macrofungos Agaricales em area de manejo florestal do Projeto BIONTE (Biomass and Nutrients of Tropical Rain Forest) na Amazonia Central, quando florestas primarias e secundarias (manejadas) foram utilizadas para monitorar, coletar e identificar macrofungos Agaricales, de acordo com quatro classes de substratos (folhas, solo, galhos e troncos), ao longo de transectos de 250m(2), durante o periodo de 2012-13. Como resultado, dos 669 macrofungos coletados, 290 especies/morfoespecies foram identificadas, sendo 44% restritas a floresta primaria e 36% a floresta secundaria. As curvas de acumulo de especies nAo atingiram a assimptota, porem analises de rarefacAo e alpha de Fisher indicaram diferencas entre as florestas de acordo com o substrato. No substrato folha, a riqueza de especies foi maior para a floresta secundaria, enquanto para o substrato solo, esse indice foi maior para a floresta primaria. Assim pode-se sugerir que a variacAo no padrAo de frutificacAo relacionado com o substrato pode ser devido a diferencas na qualidade de necromassa e/ ou no micro-clima dos sub-bosques. Alem disso, a floresta secundaria apresentou significantemente baixas riqueza e diversidade na estacAo seca quando comparada com a floresta primaria, sugerindo um efeito sinergico do impacto da sazonalidade e da historia de manejo dessas areas nas frutificacoes dos macrofungos.

AB Non-Timber Forest Products like palm fruits are fundamental in the livelihood of Amerindian groups. For the last 10years the fruits of wild palm species, like Euterpe precatoria and Mauritia flexuosa, have been entering into global markets. These species are mostly harvested felling the adults, a practice that may have a disproportionate impact in the conservation of the populations. We studied the demography of E.precatoria and M.flexuosa, two important palms of the Amazon, using integral projection models, to characterize the population dynamics and project impact of different fruit harvest methods: adult felling and direct fruit harvest. We followed over 1400 individuals from populations with low harvest intensities in the Tikuna community of Amacayacu, Amazonas, Colombia from 2011 to 2013, establishing four plots for E.precatoria in seasonally inundated forests and two for M.flexuosa in swamps. The population growth in E.precatoria was slightly declining, whereas M.flexuosa was stable. As expected, the simulations of adult felling diminished and the number of available adults under any scenario for either species. On the contrary, the simulations support existing information that climbing and other non-destructive harvest methods would probably allow a sustainable management, satisfying the demand and preserving wild populations.
   Resumen Los productos forestales no maderables, como los frutos de palma, han sido fundamentales en el sustento de grupos Amerindios. En los ultimos diez anos, los frutos de especies silvestres, como Euterpe precatoria y Mauritia flexuosa, han ingresado a la economia de mercado. Estas especies, en su mayoria, se cosechan talando los adultos, una practica que tiene un impacto desproporcionado en la conservacion de sus poblaciones. Estudiamos la demografia de E.precatoria y de M.flexuosa, en el Amazonas, usando modelos de proyeccion integral, para caracterizar su dinamica poblacional y proyectar el impacto de la cosecha de frutos mediante diferentes metodos: la tala de adultos y la cosecha directa de los frutos. Seguimos mas de 1400 individuos en poblaciones con baja cosecha en la comunidad Tikuna de Amacayacu, Amazonas, Colombia desde el 2011 al 2013, estableciendo cuatro parcelas para E.precatoria en bosques estacionalmente inundables y dos para M.flexuosa en pantanos. El crecimiento poblacional de E.precatoria represento un declive, mientras que M.flexuosa fue estable. Segun lo esperado, en las simulaciones, la cosecha de los adultos disminuyo y el numero de adultos en todos los escenarios para las dos especies. Por otro lado, los escenarios de cosecha empleando la escalada, apoyan la informacion existente en la que la escalada y otros metodos no-destructivos podrian permitir un uso sostenible, satisfaciendo la demanda y tambien preservando las poblaciones.

AB Mixed-species assemblages can involve positive and negative interactions, but uncertainty about high-value patchy resources can increase the value of information sharing among heterospecific co-foragers. I sampled species composition of bird-flocks attending army-ant raids in three adjacent elevation zones in Costa Rica, across multiple years, to test for positive and negative associations among raid-attending bird species. My goal was to test whether the most frequent and specialized raid-attending species showed evidence of facilitating or excluding other bird species. I quantified elevational variation in avian community composition at raids, then asked whether species composition was associated with variation in flock characteristics (flock size and species richness). I identified the most frequent raid-attending species (those that attended raids most frequently relative to their mist-net capture rates), and bird species that performed specialized army ant-following behavior (bivouac-checking, which allows birds to memorize and track mobile army-ant colonies). There was significant turnover of bird species among zones (including the frequent and specialized attendants); patterns of species overlap suggested a gradual transition from a Pacific-slope to an Atlantic-slope raid-attending bird fauna. Raid-attendance frequency was positively correlated with bivouac-checking behavior. With few exceptions, the most frequent raid-attending bird species, and the bivouac-checking species, also participated in the most species-rich flocks. High species-gregariousness suggests many of the frequently attending and/or bivouac-checking species functioned as core flock members. However, some bird species pairs were significantly negatively associated at raids. Despite species turnover, per-flock numbers of birds at raids did not differ among geographic zones, but flocks on the Pacific-slope were heavier because larger bodied bird species attended raids. Previous studies showed that the size (biomass) of bird-flocks corresponds to the amount of food the birds kleptoparasitize from ant raids, and the heavier Pacific-slope bird-flocks could have greater negative kleptoparasitic impacts.
   Resumen Las asociaciones de especies mixtas pueden implicar interacciones positivas y negativas, pero la incertidumbre sobre los recursos irregulares de alto valor puede aumentar el valor del intercambio de informacion entre especies. Muestree la composicion de especies de aves que acudieron a las incursiones de hormigas en tres zonas de elevacion adyacentes en Costa Rica para probar las asociaciones positivas y negativas entre las especies de aves. Mi objetivo era comprobar si las especies mas frecuentes y especializadas en aserraderos mostraban evidencia de facilitar o excluir otras especies de aves. Cuantifico la variacion con la elevacion de la composicion de la comunidad aviar en las incursiones. Luego pregunto si la composicion de las especies estaba asociada con la variacion en las caracteristicas del rebano (tamano del rebano y riqueza de las especies). Identifice las especies mas frecuentes que asistieron a las incursiones (las que asistieron a las incursiones con mayor frecuencia en relacion con sus tasas de captura de malote), y las especies de aves que realizaron un comportamiento especial (bivouac-checking, que permite a las aves memorizar y rastrear colonias moviles de las hormigas). Hubo una rotacion de especies de aves entre las zonas (incluidos los asistentes frecuentes y especializados); los patrones de superposicion de especies sugirieron una transicion gradual de una ladera del Pacifico a una fauna de aves que asistia a la invasion de la ladera Atlantica. La frecuencia de asistencia a la incursion se correlaciono positivamente con la conducta de verificacion de vivac. Con pocas excepciones, las especies mas frecuentes de aves que asistieron a la incursion, y las especies de verificacion de bivacocos, tambien participaron en las bandadas mas ricas en especies. La elevada gregariedad de especies sugiere que muchas de las especies frecuentemente atendidas y / o que vigilan los vivaques funcionan como miembros de la parvada. Sin embargo, algunos pares de especies de aves se asociaron significativamente negativamente en las incursiones. A pesar de la rotacion de las especies, el numero de aves en las incursiones no vario entre las zonas geograficas, pero las bandadas en la vertiente del Pacifico fueron mas pesadas debido a que las especies de aves de mayor cuerpo asistieron a las incursiones. Estudios anteriores demostraron que el tamano (la biomasa) de las bandadas de aves corresponde a la cantidad de alimento que los pajaros kleptoparasitize de las incursiones de hormigas, y las bandadas mas pesadas del pajaro de la cuesta del Pacifico podrian tener mayores impactos kleptoparasitarios negativos.

AB Due to anthropogenic activities, tropical rain forests face many challenges in sustaining biodiversity and maintaining global climates. This study explores how forest successional stage, tree composition, and stratum affect communities of saproxylic cerambycid beetlesconcealed feeders that play important roles in forest nutrient cycling. Forty trees in five families (Fabaceae, Lecythidaceae, Malvaceae, Moraceae, and Sapotaceae) were sampled in a mosaic of old-growth and secondary forest on the Osa Peninsula, Costa Rica. Bait branches yielded 3549 cerambycid individuals in 49 species. Species richness was almost identical in old-growth and secondary forest, and both yielded specialists, but abundance was higher in old-growth forest. Overall community structure was most strongly influenced by host plant species; within most plant families it was also impacted by forest successional status. Moraceae was the exception, presumably because the focal tree species was abundant in both old-growth and secondary forest. Several host and old-growth specialist species reached high densities within patches of old-growth forest, but seldom colonized apparently suitable trees within secondary forest. This suggests that even small areas of old-growth forest can act as refuges, but that secondary forest may act as a barrier to dispersal. The vulnerability of specialized saproxylic insects to land use change will be linked to the ability of their preferred hosts to disperse to and persist in successional habitats; rearing studies may provide the most accurate method to monitor community changes over time.
   Resumen Debido a las actividades antropogenicas, las selvas tropicales enfrentan muchos desafios en el mantenimiento de la biodiversidad y el mantenimiento de los climas mundiales. Esta investigacion explora como las etapa de sucesion de los bosques, composicion de los arboles, y el estrato afectan las comunidades de escarabajos cerambycido saproxilicos, los cuales desempenan papeles importantes en el ciclo de nutrientes del bosque. Cuarenta arboles en cinco familias (Fabaceae, Lecythidaceae, Malvaceae, Moraceae, y Sapotaceae) fueron indentificados en un mosaico de bosques maduro y secundario en la Peninsula Osa, Costa Rica. Ramas de cebo produjeron 3549 individuos Cerambycid en 49 especies. La riqueza de especies fue casi identica en bosques maduro y secundario, y ambos cedio especialistas, pero la abundancia fue mayor en los bosques de edad madura. Estructura general de la comunidad fue mas fuertemente influenciada por las especies de plantas huesped; en la mayoria de las familias de plantas que tambien se vio afectado por el estado de sucesion forestal. Moraceae fue la excepcion, presumiblemente porque las especies de arboles focales era abundante en bosques maduro y secundario. Varias especies especialistas de bosques maduro alcanzaron altas densidades dentro de los parches de bosque maduro, pero rara vez colonizaron arboles aparentemente ideales de bosque secundario. Esto sugiere que pequenas areas de bosques antiguos pueden actuar como refugios, y que los bosques secundarios pueden actuar como una barrera para la dispersion. La vulnerabilidad de los insectos saproxilicos especializados al uso diferente del suelo estara vinculada con la capacidad de dispersar de sus arboles preferidos y que se mantenga en los habitats de sucesion; los estudios de cria puede proporcionar el metodo mas preciso para monitorear los cambios de la comunidad a traves del tiempo.

AB Global amphibian declines have been attributed to several factors including the chytrid fungal pathogen, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), that infects hosts' skin and causes death by inhibiting immune response and impairing osmoregulatory function. Here, we integrate extensive new field data with previously published locality records of Bd in Colombia, a megadiverse and environmentally heterogeneous country in northwestern South America, to determine the relative importance of environmental variables and reproductive mode for predicting the risk of Bd infection in amphibians. We surveyed 81 localities across Colombia and sampled 2876 individual amphibians belonging to 14 taxonomic families. Through a combination of end-point PCR and real-time PCR analyses, Bd was detected in 338 individuals (12%) representing 43 localities (53%) distributed from sea level to 3200m. We found that annual mean temperature and variables related with seasonality in precipitation and temperature appeared to define the most suitable areas for the establishment of the pathogen. In addition, prevalence of infection appeared to be higher in species with a terrestrial reproductive mode. Our study provides the first large-scale study of the current and potential distribution of Bd in the biodiversity hotspot centered on Colombia. We hope the newly provided information on the extent of the distribution of the pathogen and the potential areas where Bd may impact the amphibian fauna will inform decision making by environmental authorities and future conservation action.
   Resumen La disminucion de anfibios a nivel mundial se ha atribuido a varios factores incluyendo el hongo patogeno Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). Este hongo afecta la piel de los hospederos y causa la muerte de las especies susceptibles debido a la inhibicion de la respuesta inmune y al deterioro de la funcion osmorregulatoria. Para determinar la importancia relativa de variables ambientales y de historia de vida (modo reproductivo) como predictores de la presencia de Bd, en este estudio integramos nuevos datos de campo con registros previamente publicados de presencia de Bd para Colombia, un pais megadiverso y ambientalmente muy heterogeneo ubicado en el noroeste de Suramerica. En total se muestrearon 81 localidades en toda Colombia y se tomaron frotis de 2876 anfibios pertenecientes a 14 familias taxonomicas. A traves de una combinacion de PCR convencional y PCR en tiempo real, Bd se detecto en 338 individuos (12%) que representan 43 localidades (53%) distribuidas desde el nivel del mar hasta los 3200m. Encontramos que la temperatura media anual y variables relacionadas con la estacionalidad de la precipitacion y la temperatura parecen ser buenos predictores de las zonas mas apropiadas para el establecimiento del patogeno. Ademas, nuestros resultados sugieren que la prevalencia de la infeccion es mayor en especies con modo de reproduccion terrestre. Este estudio, corresponde a la primera aproximacion donde se determina la actual y potencial distribucion del hongo quitridio en Colombia. Esperamos que la informacion suministrada en nuestro estudio, sobre la distribucion del patogeno en el pais y las potenciales areas donde podria tener un mayor impacto facilitara la toma de decisiones por parte de las autoridades ambientales y promovera el desarrollo de nuevas politicas de conservacion en pro de la conservacion de los anfibios.

AB The factors explaining species turnover at different spatial scales have been intensively studied, but most work in Amazonia has mainly focused on plants. For animals, it is not as obvious which environmental variables most affect differences in species composition among sites. We sought to identify what causes anuran turnover in Amazonian terra firme forests, and how the effectiveness of these factors varies among regions and across spatial scales. We sampled frogs in 56 plots along ponds and streams distributed over three terra firme forest areas in Eastern Amazonia. Using multiple regressions on distance matrices, we partitioned the variation in species turnover into components explained by variation in environmental and spatial distances. This was done in parallel for each area separately, and for all areas together, to assess the consistency of results between scales and across areas at the same scale. Each community seemed to respond to a set of factors specific to that area, and the identity of the variables that emerged as significant differed among areas and scales. Both geographical distances and environmental differences had larger explanatory power at the regional scale than at the local scale. The large differences among results from different areas caution against making broad generalizations about species turnover patterns from a single community, as real differences may exist among areas.
   Resumo Os fatores que explicam a substituicAo de especies em diferentes escalas espaciais tem sido intensivamente estudados, mas a maioria dos trabalhos na Amazonia enfatizam comunidades de plantas. Menos atencAo tem sido dada a animais, aos quais nAo sAo obvias quais variaveis ambientais deveriam ser consideradas quando estudamos diferencas na composicAo de especies entre locais. Nosso objetivo nesse estudo e entender os determinantes ambientais e espaciais da substituicAo de anuros em florestas de terra firme amazonicas, e como a percepcAo desses pode mudar entre regioes e escalas espaciais. Coletamos sapos em 56 parcelas com corpos d'agua, distribuidos em tres areas de floresta de terra firme na Amazonia Oriental. Utilizando regressoes multiplas em matrizes de distancia, nos particionamos a variacAo da substituicAo de especies em componentes explicados pela variacAo nos fatores ambientais e distancias espaciais. Isto foi feito em paralelo para cada area e para todas as areas juntas, de forma a acessar o quAo consistentes os dados sAo entre escalas diferentes e areas em uma mesma escala. Cada comunidade parece responder a um conjunto de fatores especificos de cada area, e a identidades dessas variaveis ambientais que se mostraram significantes foram diferentes entre areas e escalas. Tanto a distancia geografica quanto diferencas ambientais tiveram maior poder de explicacAo em escala regional (R-2=42.1%) do que em escala local (R-2=3.5-36.2%, dependendo da area). A grande diferenca entre resultados obtidos em diferentes areas alertam contra fazer grandes generalizacoes acerca dos padroes de substituicoes de especies de uma comunidade para outra, ja que diferencas significativas podem existir entre areas.

AB Parasites are essential components of ecosystems and can be instrumental in maintaining host diversity and populations; however, their role in trophic interactions has often been overlooked. Three apicomplexan parasite species of Sarcocystis (S.singaporensis, S.zamani, and S.villivillosi) use the reticulated python as their definitive hosts and several species within the Rattus genus as intermediate hosts, and they form a system useful for studying interactions between host-parasite and predator-prey relationships, as well as anthropogenic impacts on parasite transmission. Based on predictions from a 1998 survey, which detected an inverse relationship between urban development and Sarcocystis infection in Rattus, we tested the hypothesis that Sarcocystis transmission in Singapore will decrease over time due to anthropogenic activities. Despite a large proportion of the reticulated python diet consisting of Rattus species at all sizes of pythons, Sarcocystis infection rates decreased from 1998 to 2010. Pythons found in industrial areas had lower Sarcocystis infection rates, particularly in the western industrial area of Singapore Island. Average python size also decreased, with implications that we predict may disrupt host-parasite relationships. Anthropogenic activities such as habitat modification, fragmentation, and systematic removal and translocation of pythons have negative impacts on Sarcocystis transmission in Singapore, which in turn may augment pest rat populations. Trends observed may ultimately have negative impacts on human health and biodiversity in the region.

AB Ecotourism generates important revenue in many developing economies, but poorly regulated ecotourism can threaten the long-term viability of key biological resources. We determined the effects of tourism, boat traffic, and natural disturbances on parrot geophagy (soil consumption) across seven riverine claylicks in the lowlands of Madre de Dios, Peru. Claylick use significantly decreased when visitors did not follow good practice guidelines and tourist numbers exceeded the capacity of the observation blinds. Otherwise, tourist presence and natural disturbance did not have a significant effect. However, large macaws, particularly Red-and-green Macaws (Ara chloropterus), avoided visiting claylicks during periods of peak tourist numbers. Where parrots had multiple geophagy sites to choose from, they preferred sites further from tourist groups. The effect of boat disturbance was greatest on a narrow river with infrequent boat events. On a wider river with heavier traffic, boat disturbance had less of an effect and this effect was inversely proportional to the distance of boats from the claylick. Where visitors followed good-practice tourism guidelines, they had a low overall negative effect on parrot geophagy. We recommend that visitors respect the claylick observation guidelines to minimize anthropogenic disturbance on parrots and maintain these sites for the benefit of wildlife and humans alike.

AB Land-use change threatens biodiversity and ecosystem function worldwide. These changes have impacts on weather patterns, carbon storage, biodiversity, and other ecosystem services from regional to local scales. Only 8 percent of tropical forests are formally recognized as conservation areas, however globally, there is a network of sites that are protected because they are sacred and as a result act as shadow' conservation for biodiversity. Unlike other types of protected sites (e.g., national parks), these sites are seats of religious ritual that anchor a community's cultural identity, while also conserving biological diversity and other ecosystem services. We studied the extent and status of sacred forests in northern Ethiopia, which are threatened because of their small size (similar to 5ha) and isolation, increasing their exposure to edge effects and human pressures. Using historical and modern imagery, we found that over the last 50yr, sacred forests have increased in area, but decreased in crown closure. We also found that forest ecological status, via ground-level investigation, had high mean human disturbance (e.g., trails, plantations, exotic planting; 37%); and that forests close to markets (e.g., cities) increased in area due to planting of Eucalyptus (exotic), indicating a potential threat to their persistence and value as shelters of the church.

AB Debate about the conservation value of secondary habitats has tended to focus on tropical forests, increasingly recognizing the role of secondary forests for biodiversity conservation. However, there remains a lack of information about the conservation value of secondary savannas. Here, we conducted a camera trap survey to assess the effect of secondary vegetation on large mammals in a Brazilian Cerrado protected area, using a single-season occupancy framework to investigate the response of individual species (species-level models) and of all species combined (community-level models). In addition, we investigated the cost effectiveness of different sampling designs to monitor globally threatened species in the study area. At the community level, savanna that regenerated from eucalyptus plantation had similar occupancy estimate as old growth areas. At the species level, none of the ten species individually assessed seemed to respond to succession stage, with greater support for the effect of other covariates on occupancy, such as distance from water and vegetation physiognomy. These results demonstrate that secondary vegetation does not appear to negatively impact large mammals in the study area and suggest that, given a favorable context, Cerrado mammals can recolonize and use secondary savannas that regenerated from clearcut. However, our study area should be considered a best-case scenario, as it retained key ecological attributes of high-value secondary habitats. Our simulations showed that a sampling design with 60 camera trap sites surveyed during nine occasions is appropriate to monitor most globally threatened species in the study area, and could be a useful starting point for new monitoring initiatives in other Cerrado areas.
   RESUMO O debate sobre a importancia de habitats secundarios para a conservacAo tende a focar em florestas tropicais, existindo evidencia consideravel sobre o papel das florestas secundarias na manutencAo da biodiversidade. Entretanto, praticamente nAo existe informacAo sobre a importancia de savanas secundarias para a conservacAo da biodiversidade. Neste trabalho realizamos uma amostragem atraves de armadilhas fotograficas para avaliar o efeito da vegetacAo secundaria sobre mamiferos de medio e grande porte em uma unidade de conservacAo do Cerrado, utilizando modelos de ocupacAo para investigar a resposta da comunidade (modelos de comunidade) e de cada especie individualmente (modelos de especie). Investigamos tambem o custo-beneficio de diferentes desenhos amostrais para monitorar especies globalmente ameacadas de extincAo na area de estudo. Nos modelos de comunidade, areas secundarias que regeneraram do plantio de eucalipto tiveram estimativa de ocupacAo similar as areas primarias. De acordo com os modelos de especie, nenhuma das 10 especies avaliadas parece responder ao estagio sucessional da vegetacAo, existindo maior suporte para o efeito de outras variaveis na estimativa de ocupacAo, como distancia da agua e fitofisionomia. Estes resultados mostram que aparentemente a vegetacAo secundaria nAo afeta de forma negativa os mamiferos de medio e grande porte na area de estudo. Alem disso, os resultados sugerem que, em um contexto favoravel, mamiferos do Cerrado podem recolonizar e usar habitats secundarios que regeneraram apos o corte raso. Entretanto, nossa area de estudo deve ser considerada como uma situacAo ideal, ja que manteve importantes atributos ecologicos de habitats secundarios de alto valor para a conservacAo. Nossas simulacoes mostraram que um desenho amostral com 60 pontos de armadilhas fotograficas amostrados durante nove ocasioes e apropriado para monitorar a maioria das especies globalmente ameacadas presentes na area de estudo, e pode ser um ponto de partida para novas iniciativas de monitoramento em outras areas do Cerrado.

As financial resources are essential for effectively managing PAs, we analyzed the Brazilian Government's budgetallocated to 20 federal PAs in the Caatinga between 2008 and 2014, which ranged from 231,575 USD in 2008 to 13.5 Mi USD in 2011. Neither expenses, nor the availability of funds, were homogeneous among PAs or throughout the years. Land acquisition in a single PA consumed similar to 75% of the budget, and the two smallest PAs received proportionally the most money. Excluding land acquisition, the 20 PAs received 0.50 USD/ha/year. Funds were allocated not to biodiversity conservation per se but mainly to securing offices, cars, and equipment. From 2012 onwards, the PA budget was reduced. Even including salaries, the budgetallocated for these PAs is similar to 13 times lower than what the Ministry of the Environment declared necessary for the basic operation of protected areas in Brazil, 1.5 times lower than values spent worldwide, up to 5 times lower than spent in Latin American and African parks, and up to 72 times lower than spent in the European Union, exposing one cause of the precarious situation of the Caatinga PAs.
   Resumo A protecAo insitu e uma das formas mais efetivas para a conservacAo da biodiversidade e o Brasil tem um dos maiores sistemas de areas protegidas (APs) do mundo. A distribuicAo das APs brasileiras e heterogenea entre os biomas e a Caatinga esta entro os menos protegidos. A disponibilidade de recursos financeiros e imprescindivel para uma boa gestAo de APs. Este estudo analisou o orcamento disponibilizado pelo Ministerio do Meio Ambiente do Brasil para 20 APs federais da Caatinga, de 2008 a 2014. Os valores variaram de 231,575 USD, em 2008, ate 13.5 Mi USD, em 2011. Entretanto, a regularizacAo fundiaria de apenas uma AP consumiu similar to 75% do orcamento total do periodo. NAo houve padronizacAo de gastos ou de disponibilidade de recursos entre APs e anos. As duas menores APs receberam proporcionalmente mais dinheiro que todas as demais. Excluindo-se gastos com regularizacAo fundiaria, as 20 APs receberam em media 0.50 USD/ha/ano e os fundos nAo foram alocados para conservacAo da biodiversidade per se mas, ao contrario, para vigilancia patrimonial de escritorios, carros e equipamentos. A partir de 2012 uma tendencia de prover as APs com orcamentos crescentes foi interrompida e revertida, tornando o cenario financeiro instavel. Mesmo computando estimativas de salarios, o orcamento medio alocado para estas 20 APs e similar to 13 vezes inferior aos valores apontados pelo proprio Ministerio do Meio Ambiente como necessarios ao funcionamento basico de uma unidade de conservacAo no Brasil, cerca de 1.5 vezes inferior ao gasto medio global, ate cinco vezes abaixo do gasto em parques da America Latina e africa, e ate 72 vezes inferior ao gasto na UniAo Europeia, expondo uma das causas da precaria situacAo das APs da Caatinga brasileira.

AB The Caatinga is a botanically unique semi-arid ecosystem in northeast Brazil whose vegetation is adapted to the periodic droughts that characterize this region. However, recent extreme droughts events caused by anthropogenic climate change have challenged its ecological resilience. Here, we evaluate how deforestation and protection status affect the response of the Caatinga vegetation to drought. Specifically, we compared vegetation responses to drought in natural and deforested areas as well as inside and outside protected areas, using a time-series of satellite-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and climatic data for 2008-2013. We observed a strong effect of deforestation and land protection on overall vegetation productivity and in productivity dynamics in response to precipitation. Overall, deforested areas had significantly lower NDVI and delayed greening in response to precipitation. By contrast, strictly protected areas had higher productivity and considerable resilience to low levels of precipitation, when compared to sustainable use or unprotected areas. These results highlight the importance of protected areas in protecting ecosystem processes and native vegetation in the Caatinga against the negative effects of climate change and deforestation. Given the extremely small area of the Caatinga currently under strict protection, the creation of new conservation areas must be a priority to ensure the sustainability of ecological processes and to avoid further desertification.

AB ACCURATELY DESCRIBING THE ECOLOGICAL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN SPECIES IS MORE THAN MERE SEMANTICS-doing so has profound practical and applied implications, not the least of which is that inaccurate descriptions can lead to fundamentally incorrect predicted outcomes of community composition and functioning. Accurate ecological classifications are particularly important in the context of global change, where species interactions can change rapidly following shifts in species composition. Here, we argue that many common ecological interactions-particularly competition and parasitism-can be easily confused and that we often lack empirical evidence for the full reciprocal interaction among species. To make our case and to propose a theoretical framework for addressing this problem, we use the interactions between lianas and trees, whose outcomes have myriad implications for the ecology and conservation of tropical forests e.g., Schnitzer et al. 2015).

AB The hypothesis that leaf litter breakdown in Guinean streams is governed by microorganisms was confirmed, supporting the reported latitudinal shift in decomposers' contribution to this process. The large body size of dominant macroinvertebrate decomposers (shrimps) only partially compensated for their very low densities. In contrast with other tropical regions mostly dominated by insect larvae, the functional consequences of global warming on these stream ecosystems may be less severe due to the lower sensitivity of crustaceans to temperature increase.

AB Litterfall is an essential component of tropical forest productivity, transferring nutrients from the vegetation back to soils. Here, we summarize the data from 105 estimates of fine litterfall production from 45 sites in the Atlantic Forest domain, including two types of forests, evergreen and seasonal, and two successional stages, secondary and old growth. The overall litterfall average was 8.0 +/- 2.5 Mg/ha. Litterfall was significantly in higher seasonal forests than in evergreen forests and in old growth versus secondary forests. Leaves were the major component of litterfall, contributing 68 percent to the total. The second most important component was branches, contributing 22 percent, followed by reproductive organs (flowers and fruits), at 6 percent. Accurate measurements of tropical forest productivity are crucial for estimating their role in sequestering atmospheric carbon, and we suggest some ways to standardize litterfall sampling to obtain better estimates.

AB Epiphytes are integral to tropical forests yet little is understood about how succession proceeds in these communities. As trees increase in size they create microhabitats for late-colonizing species in both small and large branches while maintaining small tree microhabitats for early colonizing species in the small and young branches. Thus, epiphyte succession may follow different models depending on the scale: at the scale of the entire tree, epiphytes may follow a species accumulation model where species are continuously added to the tree as trees increase in size but at the scale of one zone on a branch (e.g., inner crown: 0-2 m from the trunk), they may follow the replacement model of succession seen in terrestrial ecosystems. Assuming tree size as an indicator of tree age, I surveyed 61 Virola koschnyi trees of varying size (2.5-103.3 cm diameter at breast height) in lowland wet tropical forest in Costa Rica to examine how epiphyte communities change through succession. Epiphyte communities in small trees were nested subsets of those in large trees and epiphyte communities became more similar to the largest trees as trees increased in size. Furthermore, epiphyte species in small trees were replaced by mid-and late-successional species in the oldest parts of the tree crown but dispersed toward the younger branches as trees increased in size. Thus, epiphyte succession followed a replacement model in particular zones within treecrowns but a species accumulation model at the scale of the entire tree crown.

AB Tropical floodplains are one of the most productive ecosystems on earth. Studies on floodplain productivity have primarily focused on trees and macrophytes, rather than algae, due to their greater biomass. However, epiphyton-algae and bacteria attached to the submerged portion of aquatic macrophytes-is a major source of energy in many tropical floodplains. Epiphyton productivity rates are unknown for most tropical floodplain wetlands, and spatial variability is not well understood. In this study, we measured primary productivity of epiphyton in Kakadu National Park in northern Australia. We estimated the relative contribution of epiphyton to aquatic production (epiphyton, + phytoplankton + macrophytes). We sampled sites dominated by different macrophyte structural types: vertical emerging grasses, horizontal emerging grasses, submerged macrophytes, and macrophytes with floating leaves. Epiphyton productivity was highly influenced by the structural type of the macrophyte. Highest potential productivity per weight was measured from epiphyton growing on macrophytes with floating leaves and horizontal grasses (1.52 +/- 0.53 and 1.82 +/- 0.61 mgC/dw g epiphyton/h, respectively) and lowest in submerged macrophytes and vertical grasses (0.57 +/- 0.26 and 0.66 +/- 0.47 mgC/dw g epiphyton/h, respectively). When considering the areal biomass of the macrophyte and the amount of epiphyton attached, epiphyton on horizontal grasses and submerged macrophytes had productivity values approximately ten times higher (45-219 mgC/m(2)/d) compared to those on vertical grasses and macrophytes with floating leaves (2-18 mgC/m(2)/d). Epiphyton contributed between 2 to 13 percent to the aquatic production of these tropical floodplain wetlands.

AB Mangrove forests are systems that provide ecosystem services and rely on floating propagules of which the dispersal trajectories are determined by ocean currents and winds. Quantitating connectivity of mangrove patches is an important conservation concern. Current estimates of connectivity, however, fail to integrate the link between ocean currents at different spatial scales and dispersal trajectories. Here, we use high-resolution estimates of ocean currents and surface winds from meteorological and oceanographic analyses, in conjunction with experimental data on propagule traits (e.g., density, size, and shape) and dispersal vector properties (e.g., strength and direction of water and wind currents). We incorporate these data in a dispersal model to illustrate the potential effect of wind on dispersal trajectories of hydrochorous propagules from different mangrove species. We focus on the Western Indian Ocean, including the Mozambique Channel, which has received much attention because of its reported oceanic complexity, to illustrate the effect of oceanic features such as eddy currents and tides. In spite of the complex pattern of ocean surface currents and winds, some propagules are able to cross the Mozambique Channel. Eddy currents and tides may delay arrival at a suitable site. Experimentally demonstrated differences in wind sensitivity among propagule types were shown to affect the probability of departure and the shape of dispersal trajectories. The model could be used to reconstruct current fluxes of mangrove propagules that may help explain past and current distributions of mangrove forests and assess the potential for natural expansion of these forests.

AB The amount of trichomes on the leaves of Metrosideros polymorpha varies enormously, ranging from 0 to ca 150 g/m(2) across environmental gradients on the island of Hawaii. Pubescent individuals are abundant in dry areas or on young lava flows, whereas glabrous individuals are abundant in wet areas or on developed soils. To understand the adaptive advantages of pubescent individuals in arid environments, we addressed the following questions: (1) whether leaf trichomes increase the boundary layer resistance to gas diffusion, which in turn reduces the transpiration rate and increases water-use efficiency (WUE); and (2) whether pubescent individuals have other associated leaf and shoot traits that have adaptive significance in arid environments. We made detailed ecophysiological measurements on M. polymorpha in three populations in habitats that varied in aridity. We found a large allocation of leaf mass to trichomes, up to 33 percent at the arid site, but our analyses showed that trichomes had small effects (1-9%) on gas exchange and negligible effects on WUE, suggesting the trichomes may have roles beyond increasing WUE. However, pubescent individuals did have higher Rubisco amount and a lower leaf-to-sapwood area ratio, which are considered adaptive in arid environments. These results suggest that pubescent individuals of M. polymorpha are indeed adapted to arid environments with changes in a suite of traits. The adaptive significance of the enormous variation in amounts of trichomes remains unclear and may be related to functions other than increasing boundary layer resistance.

AB We assessed woody plant communities in two widely separated forests in the tropical dry forest (TDF) biome of Mexico for evidence of similar patterns of species commonness and rarity. We used belt transects laid out along contour lines (i.e., constant elevation) and stratified across elevation gradients at sites in Jalisco and Oaxaca to sample woody plant species diversity, abundance, relative frequency and basal area. We assembled a combined species list and compared species found in both sites (shared) to species found in only one site, assessing whether the most and least common species at a site tended to be shared or unshared. Of the 8242 individuals sampled, 370 species or morpho-species were identified, with 222 species recorded at the Jalisco site and 270 at the Oaxaca site-122 (33%) species were shared across sites. Abundance, frequency and basal area of shared species were greater on average than for unshared species, and were positively correlated across sites. A subset of 68 shared species (18%) accounted for over half of all individuals encountered at the two sites. Species in the most common quartile were more likely to be shared than expected by chance, while species in the least common quartile were less likely. A genus-level analysis found similar patterns. Our findings suggest that the TDF of Pacific coast Mexico shows evidence of widespread dominance by a small subset of species. These findings have potentially important implications for predicting species composition, understanding the role of oligarchic species in ecological processes, and conserving rare species.

AB Large-seeded plants may suffer seed dispersal limitation in human-modified landscapes if seed dispersers are absent or unable to disperse their seeds. We investigated dispersal limitation for the large-seeded tree Virola surinamensis in a human-modified landscape in southern Costa Rica. During two fruiting seasons, we monitored crop size, seed removal rates, the number of fruiting conspecifics within 100 m, and feeding visitation rates by frugivores at trees located in high and low forest disturbance conditions. Seed removal rates and the total number of seeds removed were high regardless of the disturbance level, but these parameters increased with tree crop size and decreased with the number of fruiting V. surinamensis trees within a 100 m radius. Trees at low disturbance levels were more likely to be visited by seed dispersers. Black mandibled toucans (Ramphastos ambiguus) and spider monkeys (Ateles geoffroyi) were the most important seed dispersers, based on visitation patterns and seed removal rates. Spider monkey feeding visits were more frequent at high disturbance levels, but the monkeys preferentially visited isolated trees with large yields and surrounded by a low number of fruiting Virola trees within 100 m. Toucan visitation patterns were not constrained by any of the predictors and they visited trees equally across the landscape. We suggest that isolated and highly fecund Virola trees are an important food resource for spider monkeys in human-modified landscapes and that toucans can provide resilience against seed dispersal limitations for large-seeded plants in human-modified landscapes in the absence of hunting.

AB Interactions among multiple species form complex networks of interdependences and are considered primary factors in the generation and maintenance of biodiversity. Pteropodid bats are keystone species that provide important ecosystem services of pollination and seed dispersal in the tropics and subtropics. In this study, we investigated the utilization and preference of food resources by the insular frugivorous flying fox Pteropus dasymallus. We found that fig species constituted the major portion of the diet of the flying fox (94.6%). When foraging, the flying fox preferred seed figs from female trees over gall figs from male trees in functionally dioecious fig species. Germination experiments showed a significantly higher percentage of germination for fig seeds in feces than those from pellets and ripe figs (feces: 80.2%, pellets: 23.4%, ripe figs: 32.9%). Considering the active selection of seed figs and avoidance of gall figs by foraging flying foxes, we suggest that the abundance of seed figs accurately represents food availability for dioecy. This preference for seed figs or viable seeds can effectively promote the survival of pollinating wasps and might reinforce the evolution of dioecism in figs. In addition, the effects of gut passage on seed germination, in combination with the capacity of flying foxes to travel long distances, may substantially contribute to the efficiency of flying foxes as seed dispersers.

AB Many factors drive the organization of communities including environmental factors, dispersal abilities, and competition. In particular, ant communities have high levels of interspecific competition and dominance that may affect community assembly processes. We used a combination of surveys and nest supplementation experiments to examine effects of a dominant ground-nesting ant (Pheidole synanthropica) on (1) arboreal twig-nesting, (2) ground-foraging, and (3) coffee-foraging ant communities in coffee agroecosystems. We surveyed these communities in high-and low-density areas of P. synanthropica over 2 years. To test for effects on twig ant recruitment, we placed artificial nesting resources on coffee plants in areas with and without P. synanthropica. The first sampling period revealed differences in ant species composition on the ground, in coffee plants, and artificial nests between high-and low-density sites of P. synanthropica. Highdensity sites also had significantly lower recruitment of twig ants and had species-specific effects on twig ant species. Prior to the second survey period, abundance of P. synanthropica declined in the high-density sites, such that P. synanthropica densities no longer differed. Subsequent sampling revealed no difference in total recruitment of twig ants to artificial nests between treatments. Likewise, surveys of ground and coffee ants no longer showed significant differences in community composition. The results from the first experimental period, followed by survey results after the decline in P. synanthropica densities suggest that dominant ants can drive community assembly via both recruitment and establishment of colonies within the community.

AB In seasonal tropical regions, rainfall and/or temporary floods during the wet season generally increase the abundance and diversity of food resources to many consumers as compared to the dry season. Therefore, seasonality can affect intraspecific competition and ecological opportunity, which are two important ecological mechanisms underlying population and individual niche variations. Here, we took advantage of the strong seasonality in the Pantanal wetlands to investigate how within-and between-individual diet variations relate to seasonal population niche dynamics of the tetra fish Astyanax lacustris. We quantified dietary niche using gut contents and stable isotopes. Tetras had higher gut fullness and better body condition in the wet season, suggesting that competition is more intense in the dry season. The population niche was broader in the wet season due to an increase in diet divergence between individuals, in spite of potential stronger competition in the dry season. We posit that low ecological opportunity in the dry season limits the diversifying effect of intraspecific competition, constraining population niche expansion. Our results add new insights on how seasonality affects population and individual diets, indicating that intraspecific competition and ecological opportunity interact to determine temporal niche variations in seasonal environments.

AB Leaf monkeys are known to be leaf eaters, and thus, their potential role as seed dispersers has been neglected. However, they do also feed on fruits. To examine the role of leaf monkeys as endozoochorous seed dispersers, we studied the Javan lutung (Trachypithecus auratus) in Indonesia. We compared multiple aspects of seed dispersal processes (amount and diversity of seeds ingested, dispersal distance, and germination rate) of lutungs with that of the sympatric long-tailed macaque (Macaca fascicularis). Over the study period, 54 percent of the lutung feces contained intact seeds, which was equivalent to the macaque feces contained seeds (62%). Seeds of at least six plant species were detected in the lutung feces, which was less than those found in the macaque feces (>19 plant species). The main species of seeds defecated by both lutungs and macaques was Ficus spp. (seed size: 0.7 mm). Seed shadow, estimated from travel distance (range: 1-299 m) and gut passage rate (24-96 h), had a unimodal-distribution with a peak at 51-100 m, and was shorter than that reported in published accounts of macaques and other similar and smaller sized frugivores. Finally, germination rates of Ficus spp. seeds ingested by both lutungs and macaques were lower than that of the control seeds. These results imply that the dispersal effectiveness of lutungs would be lower than that of the sympatric primate frugivores. However, at a population level, lutungs could play a significant role as seed dispersers for the small-seeded species, and therefore, more research into their frugivorous habits is warranted.

AB Arboreal fauna living in tropical ecosystems may be particularly affected by roads given their dependency on forest cover and the high vulnerability of such ecosystems to changes. Over a period of 4 yr, we followed subgroups of spider monkeys living in a regenerating dry tropical forest with 8.2 km of roads within their home range. We aimed to understand whether roads shaped the home range of spider monkeys and which road features affected their movement. Only 18 percent (3 km) of the spider monkeys' home range perimeter bordered with roads; these roads had greater habitat disparity between road sides than roads inside the home range. Although monkeys were reluctant to be close to roads, and roadside habitat contained low proportions of mature forest, spider monkeys crossed roads at 69 locations (7.5 crossings per kilometer). The main road characteristic affecting crossings was canopy opening size, with greater probability of crossing where canopy openings were smaller. Our findings support the importance of canopy opening size for road crossing of arboreal taxa, but they also indicate the relevant role roadside forest structure may have. Minimizing canopy opening size and forest disturbance along roads can facilitate the movement of arboreal fauna and preserve the important role of spider monkeys and other arboreal taxa in seed dispersal and thus the maintenance and regeneration of forest diversity.

AB Ecological network approaches may contribute to conservation practices by quantifying within-community importance of species. In mutualistic plant-pollinator systems, such networks reflect potential pollination of the plants and a considerable portion of the energy consumption by the pollinators, two key components for each party. Here, we used two different sampling approaches to describe mutualistic plant-hummingbird networks from a cloud forest in the Colombian Western Andes, home to the Colorful Puffleg Eriocnemis mirabilis, an endemic and critically endangered hummingbird. We contrast networks between two localities (a protected area inside a National park vs. its buffer zone) and across sampling methods (floral visitation vs. pollen loads) to assess how the network structure and the importance of each hummingbird species within the networks may change. Visitation networks were characterized as having higher sampling completeness, yet pollen load network recorded more pollen types than plant species recorded by visitation. Irrespective of the sampling methods, the Colorful Puffleg was one of the most important hummingbird species in the network within the protected area inside the National park, but not in the buffer zone. Moreover, most species-level network indices were related to hummingbirds' abundance. This suggests that conservation initiatives aimed at the endangered Colorful Puffleg may both help on the survival of this endangered hummingbird, as well as on maintaining its key role in the mutualistic interaction network inside the National Park. Our study illustrates how conservation practitioners could assess the local importance of endangered species using interaction network approaches.

AB Areas allocated for industrial logging and community-owned forests account for over 50% of all remaining tropical forests. Landscapescale conservation strategies that include these forests are expected to have substantial benefits for biodiversity, especially for large mammals and birds that require extensive habitat but that are susceptible to extirpation due to synergies between logging and hunting. In addition, their responses to logging alone are poorly understood due to their cryptic behavior and low densities. In this study, we assessed the effects of logging and hunting on detection and occupancy rates of large vertebrates in a multiple- use forest on the Guiana Shield. Our study site was certified as being responsibly managed for timber production and indigenous communities are legally guaranteed use-rights to the forest. We coupled camera-trap data for wildlife detection with a spatially explicit dataset on indigenous hunting. A multi-species occupancy model found a weak positive effect of logging on occupancy and detection rates, while hunting had a weak negative effect. Model predictions of species richness were also higher in logged forest sites compared to unlogged forest sites. Density estimates for jaguars and ocelots in our multiple- use area were similar to estimates reported for fully protected areas. Involvement of local communities in forest management, control of forest access, and nesting production forests in a landscape that includes protected areas seemed important for these positive biodiversity outcomes. The maintenance of vertebrate species bodes well for both biodiversity and the humans that depend on multiple- use forests.

AB Human activities often cause habitat fragmentation and how forest fragments affect species range distributions has implications for ecology and conservation. However, few studies have considered communities within the same landscape. Here, we analyzed metacommunity structure to determine the range distributions for species in four taxonomic groups (amphibians, birds, social wasps, and trees) in a patchy landscape of semi-deciduous Atlantic forest in southwestern Brazil. Although trees are a key component of the environment for animals in forested patches, the ranges of bird, wasp, and amphibian species did not change in concert with the species ranges of trees. The species ranges of amphibians and social wasps were unaffected by fragmentation gradients and exhibited independent distribution patterns (i.e., random structure). In contrast, birds and trees exhibited range turnover along different fragmentation gradients, indicating that species show idiosyncratic responses to abiotic factors (i.e., Gleasonian structure). For birds, some less-resilient species occurred only in fragments with a large area of native vegetation at a radius of 5km from the center of the sampled forest fragments, whereas other more stress-tolerant species occurred only in sites with small areas of native vegetation. For trees, some later succession species (e.g., animal-dispersed seeds) occurred only in fragments with high connectivity, whereas earlier-recruiting species (e.g., wind-dispersed seeds) occurred in fragments with low connectivity. Thus, determining the effects of human-modified landscapes on species range distributions, even within the same landscape, might not be a trivial task.

AB Large frugivores play an important role as seed dispersers and their extinction may affect plant regeneration. The consequences of such extinctions depend on the likelihood of other species being functionally redundant and on how post-dispersal events are affected. We assess the functional redundancy of two seed dispersers of the Atlantic Forest, the muriqui (Brachyteles arachnoides) and the tapir (Tapirus terrestris) through the comparison of their seed dispersal quality, taking into account post-dispersal events. We compare tapirs and muriquis for: (1) the dung beetle community associated with their feces; (2) the seed burial probability and burial depth by dung beetles; and (3) the seed mortality due to predators or other causes according to burial depth. We determine how seed burial affects seed dispersal effectiveness (SDE) and compare the dispersal quality of four plant species dispersed by these frugivores. Muriqui feces attract 16-fold more dung beetles per gram of fecal matter and seeds experience 10.5-fold more burial than seeds in tapir feces. In both feces types, seed mortality due to predation decreases with burial depth but seed mortality due to other causes increases. Total seed mortality differ within plant species according to the primary disperser. Therefore, the effect of seed burial on SDE varies according to the plant species, burial depth, and primary disperser. As tapirs and muriquis differently affect the seed fate, they are not functionally redundant. Since the effect of the primary disperser persists into the post-dispersal events, we should consider the cascading effects of these processes when assessing functional redundancy.

AB Seed dispersal, a key process in terrestrial landscapes, is increasingly important in the face of habitat fragmentation and global climate change. Seed dispersal is also notoriously difficult to characterize, especially in species rich and spatially complex tropical forests. We contrasted assemblages of biotically dispersed seeds collected from four sites using two methods: deposition into seed traps and interception by the capture of frugivorous birds. We also compared seed deposition and interception with local fruit production. Species accumulation curves for seeds deposited in seed traps began to level off sooner than curves for seeds collected from birds captured in mist nets, and extrapolation showed significantly greater estimated species richness for seeds collected from birds than for those deposited in traps. Assemblages from birds and from traps at each site were quite different, with an abundance-based similarity index of 0.64; this dissimilarity increases if bat-dispersed seeds are included in the analysis. Common bird-dispersed species were retrieved from both mist-netted birds and from seed traps, but numerous locally fruiting understory species were recovered only from birds. We conclude that the sampling of seeds carried by birds provides a valuable complement to other methods of studying seed dispersal in species-rich tropical forests by revealing relationships between specific dispersers and their seed plants and by creating a more complete account of species diversity of seeds being transported at a given site.

AB The greatest extent of Afromontane environments in the world is found in Ethiopia. These areas support exceptional biodiversity, but forest cover and ecological integrity have declined sharply in recent decades. Conservation and management efforts are hampered in part by an inadequate understanding of the basic ecology of major tree species. We investigated population structure and inferred population dynamics from size frequency distributions of 22 forest tree species encountered in montane forests of Ethiopia. We collected new empirical data from four sites in the Bale Mountains, where some of the country's most extensive and least disturbed forests remain, and conducted a systematic review and analysis of all such studies that reported population structure for one or more of these species in Ethiopia. Thirteen widespread montane tree species showed a reverse-J size distribution, indicating a relatively stable population structure. Six other species had size-frequency distributions that indicate episodic recruitment and/or removal of certain size classes. Specific causes of these patterns are uncertain: they may involve timber harvesting, herbivory, fire, or natural disturbances, but patterns were inconsistent and locality dependent. For three other tree species, existing data are inadequate for any interpretation of population structure and dynamics. A species of particular conservation concern that emerged from this analysis was Hagenia abyssinica, which was found in all areas to consist only of larger individuals with no recent recruitment. For management and conservation purposes, the species in most urgent need of new research are those with inadequate or inconsistent data, and H.abyssinica.

AB Light is considered a non-limiting factor for vascular epiphytes. Nevertheless, an epiphyte's access to light may be limited by phorophyte shading and the spatio-temporal environmental patchiness characteristic of epiphytic habitats. We assessed the extent to which potential light interception in Rodriguezia granadensis, an epiphytic orchid, is determined by individual factors (plant size traits and leaf traits), or environmental heterogeneity (light patchiness) within the crown of the phorophyte, or both. We studied 104 adult plants growing on Psidium guajava trees in two habitats with contrasting canopy cover: a dry tropical forest edge, and isolated trees in a pasture. We recorded the number of leaves and the leaf area, the leaf position angles, and the potential exposure of the leaf surface to direct irradiance (silhouette area of the leaf blade), and the potential irradiance incident on each plant. We found the epiphytes experience a highly heterogeneous light environment in the crowns of P.guajava. Nonetheless, R.granadensis plants displayed a common light interception strategy typical of low-light environments, resembling terrestrial, forest understory plants. Potential exposure of the total leaf surface to direct irradiance correlated positively with plant size and within-plant variation in leaf orientation. In many-leaved individuals, within-plant variation in leaf angles produced complementary leaf positions that enhanced potential light interception. This light interception strategy suggests that, in contrast to current wisdom, enhancing light capture is important for vascular epiphytes in canopies with high spatio-temporal heterogeneity in light environments.

AB Ecosystem service-driven methods of agricultural production that make optimal use of an ecosystem's natural services are often effective in smallholder crops, leading increases in habitat heterogeneity at large spatial scales that encourage beneficial species. Pollination services in cacao farms can be enhanced through efforts to conserve pollinator habitats, such as adding cacao fruit husks underneath trees to provide habitat and food resources for midge pollinators. However, it remains unclear how this habitat manipulation affects pest densities or biological control. Here, we evaluated the effects of the predaceous ant Oecophylla smaragdina on three major pests of Australian cacao (Helopeltis spp., Amblypelta spp., and Rhyparida nitida) in an Australian cacao farm, in the presence and absence of cacao fruit husks. We also evaluated the effect of O.smaragdina on their potentially plant-damaging, mutualistic mealybug (Pseudococcidae) partners in the presence and absence of cacao fruit husks. Oecophylla smaragdina reduced the combined densities of Helopeltis spp. and Amblypelta spp., regardless of cacao fruit husk addition. The ants also reduced the densities of R.nitida in the absence of cacao fruit husks, but R.nitida densities were naturally low in the experimental plots that received the addition of cacao fruit husks, regardless of ant presence. In contrast, ants generally increased the densities of mealybugs. These data suggest that O.smaragdina ants provide pest control services for three major insect pests in Australian cacao farms. Furthermore, this control may be compatible with habitat manipulations (i.e., the addition of cacao fruit husks) to improve pollinator habitat.

AB Forest fragmentation, reduced forest cover, and hunting pressure are the main threats affecting animal-mediated seed dispersal. However, their combined effects on seed dispersal rates have been simultaneously investigated only rarely, and never in Africa. We aimed to disentangle the effects of forest cover, hunting pressure, frugivore abundance, and fruit availability at the local and landscape scales on the seed dispersal rates of Staudtia kamerunensis (Myristicaceae). To estimate the percentages of seed dispersal failure (undispersed seeds), we quantitated fruit remains below fruiting trees distributed across five contrasting sites in a semi-natural forest-savanna mosaic in the Democratic Republic of Congo. We used statistical analyses accounting for spatial autocorrelation and found that forest cover in the surrounding landscape, hunting level, the associated abundance of dispersers, and fruit availability all had significant effects on the percentage of seed dispersal failure. The combination of high fruit availability and reduced abundance of seed dispersers could accelerate seed disperser satiation, causing the seed dispersal system to be saturated. Our study highlights how two major factors associated with anthropogenic activities, forest cover and hunting, affect seed dispersal by animals. These findings could have far-reaching implications for our understanding of tree-frugivore interactions and the conservation of tropical communities.

AB Afromontane landscapes are typically characterized by a mosaic of smallholder farms and the biodiversity impacts of these practices will vary in accordance to local management and landscape context. Here, we assess how tropical butterfly diversity is maintained across an agricultural landscape in the Jimma Highlands of Ethiopia. We used transect surveys to sample understory butterfly communities within degraded natural forest, semi-managed coffee forest (SMCF), exotic timber plantations, open woodland, croplands and pasture. Surveys were conducted in 29 one-hectare plots and repeated five times between January and June 2013. We found that natural forest supports higher butterfly diversity than all agricultural plots (measured with Hill's numbers). SMCF and timber plantations retain relatively high abundance and diversity, but these metrics drop off sharply in open woodland, cropland and pasture. SMCF and timber plantations share the majority of their species with natural forest and support an equivalent abundance of forest-dependent species, with no increase in widespread species. There was some incongruence in the responses of families and sub-families, notably that Lycaenidae are strongly associated with open woodland and pasture. Adult butterflies clearly utilize forested agricultural practices such as SMCF and timber plantations, but species diversity declines steeply with distance from natural forest suggesting that earlier life-stages may depend on host plants and/or microclimatic conditions that are lost under agricultural management. From a management perspective, the protection of natural forest remains a priority for tropical butterfly conservation, but understanding functioning of the wider landscape mosaic is important as SMCF and timber plantations may act as habitat corridors that facilitate movement between forest fragments.

AB Tropical butterfly conservation strategies often focus on total and/or common species richness to assess the conservation value of a patch or habitat. However, such a strategy overlooks the unique dynamics of rare species. We evaluated the species-habitat relationships of 209 common, intermediate, and rare butterfly species (including morphospecies) across four habitat types (mature, degraded, or fragmented forest, and urban parks) and two patch sizes (<400ha, >= 400ha) in Singapore. Common species richness was consistent across habitat types. Intermediate species richness declined by more than 50 percent in urban parks (relative to all forest habitats), and rare species richness was reduced by 50 percent in degraded and fragmented forest and by 90 percent in urban parks (relative to mature forest). Large patches had comparable overall richness to small patches, but they supported more rare species and three times as many habitat-restricted species over a similar area. Importantly, a number of rare species were confined to single small patches. Mixed-effects regression models were constructed to identify habitat and ecological/life history variables associated with butterfly abundance. These models revealed that species with greater habitat specialization, rare larval host plants, few larval host plant genera, and narrow global geographic ranges were more likely to be rare species. Overall, these results demonstrate that the richness of habitat-restricted and rare species do not follow the same spatial distribution patterns as common species. Therefore, while conserving mature forests is key, effective butterfly conservation in a transformed landscape should take into account rare and habitat-restricted species.

AB Animals can evade predators in multiple ways, one of the most effective of which is to avoid detection in the first place. We know much about the evolution of color patterns that match the visual background to avoid detection (i.e., crypsis), yet we know surprisingly less about the specific behaviors that have co-evolved with these morphological traits to enhance or maintain crypsis. We here explore whether the match between body color and background in a seemingly well-camouflaged tropical shore crab is a result of active background choice. Taking advantage of a coastal area in the Solomon Islands with variable sand color and a population of the pallid ghost crab Ocypode pallidula with varying carapace color, we experimentally tested whether individuals actively choose specific substrate that best matches their color patterns. We found that individuals taken from extreme sand colors chose substrate that maintained crypsis, with relatively darker crabs typically choosing dark sand and lighter crabs choosing light sand. Crabs of intermediate color pattern, in contrast, showed no clear preference for dark or light sand. Our results suggest that potential prey can actively choose specific backgrounds to enhance and maintain crypsis, providing insights into how behavior interacts with morphological traits to avoid predator detection.

AB Anuran breeding activity is frequently linked to environmental factors, mainly temperature and rainfall. However, a key feature of anuran reproductive behaviorgathering in choruses and producing loud advertisement calls to attract femalesgenerates a conspicuous social cue that may also facilitate reproductive behavior. Here, I examine the relative importance of environmental and social factors in explaining the intensity of reproductive activity in the Neotropical treefrog Hypsiboas rosenbergi. I show that social cues generally play an important role, but that there are sex differences: male behavior is associated with a combination of environmental and social factors, while female behavior is associated almost exclusively with social cues. I discuss the potential benefits of using social cues in regulating breeding activity, and suggest that conservation efforts may take advantage of the apparently widespread pattern of social facilitation in anuran reproductive ecology.

AB Bats in temperate and subtropical regions typically synchronize birth of a single young with peaks in resource availability driven by local climate patterns. In tropical rain forest, insects are available throughout the year, potentially allowing departures from seasonal monoestry. However, reproductive energy budgets may be constrained by the cost of commuting to foraging grounds from distant roosts. To test these hypotheses, we simultaneously tracked female reproductive activity of 11 insectivorous bat species, insect biomass, and local weather variables for 20months in a Malaysian rain forest. Five species roost in forest structures and hence have low commuting costs, whereas six species depend on caves, which are limited in the landscape, and are presumed to incur higher commuting costs to foraging sites. Monthly insect biomass was positively correlated with monthly rainfall, and there was a significant relationship between insect biomass and lactation in cave-roosting but not forest-roosting species. Cave-roosting species were seasonally monoestrus, with parturition confined to a two-month period, whereas in forest-roosting species, pregnancy and lactation were recorded throughout the year. Our results suggest that the energetic costs of commuting from roosts to foraging grounds shape annual reproductive patterns in tropical rain forest insectivorous bats. Ongoing changes in forest landscapes are likely to increase these costs for cave-roosting bats, further restricting reproductive opportunities. Climate change is projected to influence the timing of rainfall events in many tropical habitats, which may disrupt relationships between rainfall, insect biomass, and bat reproductive timing, further compromising reproductive success.

AB Owing to the late Pleistocene extinctions, the megafauna of Europe, Australia and the Americas disappeared, and with them the dispersal service they offered megafaunal fruit. The African savanna elephant, the largest remaining megaherbivore, offers valuable insights into the seed dispersal services provided by extinct megafauna in prehistoric times. Elephant seed dispersal studies have for the most part concentrated on African and Asian forest elephants. African savanna elephants are morphologically distinct from their forest counterparts. Like the forest elephants they consume large quantities of fruit from a large number of tree species. Despite this little is known of the savanna trees that rely on elephants for their dispersal or the spatial scale at which these seeds are dispersed. We combined information from feeding trials conducted on four park elephants with field telemetry data from 38 collared elephants collected over an 8-year period in APNR/Kruger National Park to assess the seed dispersal service provided by savanna elephants. This study provides the first detailed account of the spatial scale at which African savanna elephants disperse seeds. Our mechanistic model predicts that 50 percent of seeds are carried over 2.5km, and distances up to 65km are achievable in maximum gut passage time. These findings suggest the savanna elephant as the longest distance terrestrial vertebrate disperser yet investigated. Maintaining their ecological role as a seed disperser may prove a significant factor in the conservation of large-fruited tree diversity within the savannas. These results suggest that extinct megafauna offered a functionally unique dispersal service to megafaunal fruit.

AB Fungus-growing termites of the subfamily Macrotermitinae together with their highly specialized fungal symbionts (Termitomyces) are primary decomposers of dead plant matter in many African savanna ecosystems. The termites provide crucial ecosystem services also by modifying soil properties, translocating nutrients, and as important drivers of plant succession. Despite their obvious ecological importance, many basic features in the biology of fungus-growing termites and especially their fungal symbionts remain poorly known, and no studies have so far focused on possible habitat-level differences in symbiont diversity across heterogeneous landscapes. We studied the species identities of Macrotermes termites and their Termitomyces symbionts by excavating 143 termite mounds at eight study sites in the semiarid Tsavo Ecosystem of southern Kenya. Reference specimens were identified by sequencing the COI region from termites and the ITS region from symbiotic fungi. The results demonstrate that the regional Macrotermes community in Tsavo includes two sympatric species (M.subhyalinus and M.michaelseni) which cultivate and largely share three species of Termitomyces symbionts. A single species of fungus is always found in each termite mound, but even closely adjacent colonies of the same termite species often house evolutionarily divergent fungi. The species identities of both partners vary markedly between sites, suggesting hitherto unknown differences in their ecological requirements. It is apparent that both habitat heterogeneity and disturbance history can influence the regional distribution patterns of both partners in symbiosis.

AB Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) is a nutritious legume crop for both its grain and leaves and comprises an important component in both human and animal nutrition. In Brazil, the use of mulch, such as coconut fiber, and organic fertilizers to maximize cowpea production offers an alternative to conventional mineral fertilizer strategies. Farming practices affect the diversity and activity of soil microorganisms, including arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), important plant growth promoters for legumes. Our objective was to determine the effect of mulching with coconut fiber and manure on AMF diversity in cowpea. Soil samples were collected from an Experimental Station in Petrolina, NE Brazil: one Caatinga (natural dry-forest vegetation), one fallow, and one experimental site established in the fallow area and cultivated with cowpea receiving cattle manure and four doses (0, 12, 24, 48 t/ha) of coconut fiber. AMF species richness, abundance, and diversity were evaluated. Sixty-four AMF species were recorded, with predominance of Glomeraceae and Acaulosporaceae. Highest species richness (47) was recovered from the Caatinga but AMF diversity was also high in the cultivated sites, demonstrating the importance of mycotrophic plants, such as cowpea, in crop production systems for the maintenance of AMF species richness. Although several species, such as Claroideoglomus etunicatum, Acaulospora scrobiculata, Glomus trufemii, and Paraglomus pernambucanum, revealed pronounced sporulation patterns, even high doses of coconut fiber did not affect AMF richness and diversity, compared to fallow. Consequently, cultivation of mycotrophic plants and use of organic manures are able to maintain high AMF species richness in tropical agroecosystems.

AB Alnus acuminata is a keystone tree species in the Yungas forests and host to a wide range of fungal symbionts. While species distribution models (SDMs) are routinely used for plants and animals to study the effects of climate change on montane forest communities, employing SDMs in fungi has been hindered by the lack of data on their geographic distribution. The well-known host specificity and common biogeographic history of A.acuminata and associated ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi provide an exceptional opportunity to model the potential habitat for this symbiotic assemblage and to predict possible climate-driven changes in the future. We (1) modeled the present and future distributions of suitable habitats for A.acuminata; (2) characterized fungal communities in different altitudinal zones of the Yungas using DNA metabarcoding of soil and root samples; and (3) selected fungi that were significant indicators of Alnus. Fungal communities were strongly structured according to altitudinal forest types and the presence of Alnus. Fungal indicators of Alnus, particularly ECM and root endophytic fungi, were also detected in Alnus roots. Current and future (year 2050) habitat models developed for A.acuminata predict a 25-50 percent decrease in suitable area and an upslope shift of the suitable habitat by ca. 184-380m, depending on the climate change scenario. Although A.acuminata is considered to be an effective disperser, recent studies suggest that Andean grasslands are remarkably resistant to forest invasion, and future range contraction for A.acuminata may be even more pronounced than predicted by our models.
   ResumenAlnus acuminata es una especie arborea clave en el ecosistema de las Yungas, siendo hospedante de una gran diversidad de simbiontes fungicos. Mientras que el uso de modelos de distribucion de especies (MDS) se ha vuelto rutinario para estudiar los efectos del cambio climatico sobre las comunidades vegetales y animales en bosques de montana, la carencia de datos de distribucion geografica para comunidades fungicas ha obstaculizado el uso de MDS en hongos. No obstante, teniendo en cuenta la alta especificidad de los simbiontes ectomicorricicos (ECM) asociados al aliso, se uso una aproximacion indirecta para estimar la distribucion potencial del habitat de los hongos restringidos a los bosques de Alnus, basandose en el modelado de la ocurrencia del hospedante. En este trabajo 1) se modelo la distribucion presente y futura de habitat adecuado para A.acuminata; 2) se caracterizaron las comunidades fungicas en diferentes zonas altitudinales de las Yungas usando metagenomica en muestras de suelo y raices; y 3) se seleccionaron aquellos hongos que fueran indicadores de Alnus. Las comunidades fungicas mostraron una fuerte estructuracion segun los tipos de bosques altitudinales y a la presencia de Alnus. Los hongos resultaron indicadores de Alnus, destacandose los hongos ECM y endofitos radicales, tambien fueron encontrados mayoritariamente en las raices de Alnus. Los modelos de habitat presente y futuro (2050) desarrollados para A.acuminata predijeron una perdida del 25 a 50 por ciento del area adecuada y un cambio de entre 184 a 380m en la distribucion del area adecuada hacia mayores elevaciones dependiendo del escenario de cambio climatico aplicado. Aunque A.acuminata es considerado un dispersor muy efectivo, estudios recientes sugieren que los pastizales andinos son muy resistentes a invasiones de vegetacion boscosa lo cual puede indicar que futuras contracciones en el area ocupada por A.acuminata pueden ser mas severas de lo que nuestros modelos indican.

AB Canopy soils can significantly contribute to aboveground labile biomass, especially in tropical montane forests. Whether they also contribute to the exchange of greenhouse gases is unknown. To examine the importance of canopy soils to tropical forest-soil greenhouse gas exchange, we quantified gas fluxes from canopy soil cores along an elevation gradient with 4yr of nutrient addition to the forest floor. Canopy soil contributed 5-12 percent of combined (canopy + forest floor) soil CO2 emissions but CH4 and N2O fluxes were low. At 2000m, phosphorus decreased CO2 emissions (>40%) and nitrogen slightly increased CH4 uptake and N2O emissions. Our results show that canopy soils may contribute significantly to combined soil greenhouse gas fluxes in montane regions with high accumulations of canopy soil. We also show that changes in fluxes could occur with chronic nutrient deposition.
   Resumen Los suelos del dosel pueden contribuir de manera significativa a la biomasa labil sobre el suelo, especialmente en los bosques tropicales de montana. Pero es desconocido si contribuyen al intercambio de gases de efecto invernadero. Para examinar la importancia de los suelos del dosel en el intercambio de gases de efecto invernadero en el suelo de los bosques tropicales, cuantificamos los flujos de gases de muestras de suelo del dosel a lo largo de un gradiente altitudinal, donde se ha experimentado 4 anos con la adicion de nutrientes al suelo del bosque. El suelo del dosel aporto entre el 5-12 por ciento de las emisiones de CO2 en suelos combinados (suelo del dosel + suelo del bosque), pero los flujos de CH4 y N2O fueron bajos. En 2000m, el fosforo provoca un decrecimiento en la emision de CO2 (>40%) y el nitrogeno incrementa un poco la absorcion de CH4 y la emision de N2O. Nuestros resultados muestan que los suelos del dosel contribuirian significativamente al intercambio de gases de efecto invernadero en suelos combinados, en las regiones montanas con la alta acumulacion de los suelos del dosel. Ademas, muestan que los cambios en estos flujos ocurririan por la deposicion cronica de nutrientes.

AB Harvesting of Non-Timber Forest Products (NTFPs) can threaten target species, especially those with limited distribution and density. Exploited species also face threats from habitat fragmentation, fire, and invasive species. We assessed the impact of human disturbances and invasive species on the population of a key multipurpose NTFP species, Mimusops andongensis, in Lama Forest reserve (Benin). The densities of adult trees and regenerative stems decreased with increasing degradation. Mimusops andongensis contributed less to total tree density with increasing human disturbance. There were significantly fewer M. andongensis recruits with increasing cover of invasive Chromolaena odorata. Smaller diameter individuals predominated in non-degraded and moderately degraded sites while in degraded sites, the structure showed a negative exponential trend with the density of small diameter individuals being less than two trees/ha. Larger individuals were also rare in degraded sites. The low density of both mature trees and seedlings in degraded sites may undermine the long-term viability of M. andongensis, despite existing protection against NTFP harvesting and other anthropogenic pressures. Management should emphasize facilitating recruitment subsidies and limiting the presence of C. odorata.
   Resume L'exploitation des Produits Forestiers Non-Ligneux (PFNL) represente une menace a la conservation de nombre d'especes forestieres particulierement celles dont la distribution est assez limitee. Cette etude vise a identifier l'impact de la degradation de la foret et l'invasion par Chromolaena odorata sur les populations de Mimusops andongensis au Benin. Ceci a ete possible grace a un inventaire forestier realise dans la foret Classee de la Lama. Les plus fortes densites des arbres et de la regenerationont ete observees dans les parties les moins degradees de la foret et les densites les plus faibles dans les plus degradees. Il existe une relation negative significative entre la couverture en C. odorata et la densite de regeneration de l'espece. Les structures en diametre ont montre la dominance des sujets de petits diametres dans les parties relativement intactes et celles moyennement degradees tandis que dans les parties les plus degradees, elles ont montre une allure exponentielle decroissante. Les resultats ont montre une faible presence des arbres matures dans les zones degradees de la foret accompagnee par une faible densite de regeneration,ce qui ne garantie pas la conservation a long-terme de l'espece meme en protegeant la foret contre la collecte de PFNL et autres pressions anthropiques. Nous concluons un suivi de la disponibilite en semences, de la regeneration naturelle de l'espece ainsi que des essais de multiplication vegetative aux fins de sa preservation.

AB In seed predation studies, removal of a seed is only the first step of a dynamic process that may result in dispersal rather than seed death. This process, termed seed fate, has received little attention in African forests, particularly in Central Africa. We experimentally assessed the initial steps of seed fate for two tree speciesthe large-seeded Pentaclethra macrophylla and the relatively small-seeded Gambeya lacourtianain northeastern Gabon. Specifically, we evaluated whether seed size and seed consumer identity are important determinants of seed fate. We established experimental stations under conspecific fruiting trees, each comprising three seeds fitted with telemetric thread tags to facilitate their recovery, and a motion-sensitive camera to identify visiting mammals. In total, animals removed 76 tagged seeds from experimental stations. Small Murid rats and mice primarily removed small Gambeya seeds, whereas large-bodied rodents and mandrills primarily removed large Pentaclethra seeds. Gambeya seeds were carried shorter distances than Pentaclethra seeds and were less likely to be cached. The two large-bodied rodents handled seeds differently: Cricetomys emini larderhoarded nearly all (N=15 of 16) encountered Pentaclethra seeds deep in burrows, while Atherurus africanus cached all (N=5 of 5) encountered Pentaclethra seeds singly under 1-3cm of leaf litter and soil, at an average distance of 24.2m and a maximum distance of 46.3m from experimental stations. This study supports the hypothesis that seed fate varies based on seed size and seed consumer identity, and represents the first telemetric experimental evidence of larderhoarding and scatterhoarding in the region.
   Resume Dans les etudes de predation des graines, l'enlevement d'une graine n'est que la premiere etape d'un processus dynamique qui conduit soit a l'etablissement des semis, soit a la mort. Ce processus, appele << destin des graines >>, a recu tres peu d'attention dans les forets africaines, en particulier dans Afrique Centrale. Dans cette etude, nous avons evalue a titre experimental les etapes initiales du destin des graines de deux especes d'arbresla grande graine Pentaclethra macrophylla et la relativement petite graine Gambeya lacourtianadans le nord-est du Gabon. Plus precisement, nous avons evalue si la taille des graines et l'identite des predateurs des graines sont des determinants importants du destin des graines. Nous avons etabli des stations de graine experimentales, sous les arbres fruitiers de la meme espece, composees de trois graines equipees de balises telemetriques pour faciliter leur recuperation, et un appareil photo automatise (camera piege) pour identifier les predateurs de graines. Au total, les animaux ont enleve des stations experimentales 76 graines marquees. Les petits rats de la famille Muridae ont principalement enlevees les petites graines de Gambeya, alors que les gros rongeurs et mandrills ont principalement enleve les grosses graines de Pentaclethra. Les graines Gambeya ont ete deplacees a des distances plus courtes que les graines Pentaclethra, et etaient moins susceptibles d'etre mises en cachees. Les deux grands rongeurs ont traite les graines differemment: les Cricetomys emini se construisent des caches alimentaires comme garde-manger, et ont amasse presque toutes (N=15 de 16) des graines Pentaclethra dans leurs terriers, tandis que les'Atherurus africanus se construisent des caches eparpillees et ont cache toutes (N=5 de 5) des graines Pentaclethra dans des caches peu profondes, a une distance moyenne de 24,2m et une distance maximale de 46,3m des stations experimentales. Cela represente la premiere preuve experimentale telemetrique des caches alimentaires comme garde-manger et des caches eparpillees par de grands rongeurs de la region.

AB Many species of Dipterocarpaceae and other plant families reproduce synchronously at irregular, multi-year intervals in Southeast Asian forests. These community-wide general flowering events are thought to facilitate seed survival through satiation of generalist seed predators. During a general flowering event, closely related Shorea species (Dipterocarpaceae) stagger their flowering times by several weeks, which may minimize cross pollination and interspecific competition for pollinators. Generalist, pre-dispersal seed predators might also track flowering hosts and influence predator satiation. We addressed the question of whether pre-dispersal seed predation differed between early and late flowering Shorea species by monitoring flowering, fruiting and seed predation intensity over two general flowering events at the Pasoh Research Forest, Malaysia. Pre-dispersal insect seed predators killed up to 63 percent of developing seeds, with Nanophyes shoreae, a weevil that feeds on immature seeds being the most important predator for all Shorea species. This weevil caused significantly greater pre-dispersal seed predation in earlier flowering species. Long larval development time precluded oviposition by adults that emerged from the earliest flowering Shorea on the final flowering Shorea. In contrast, larvae of weevils that feed on mature seeds before seed dispersal (Alcidodes spp.), appeared in seeds of all Shorea species almost simultaneously. We conclude that general flowering events have the potential to satiate post-dispersal seed predators and pre-dispersal seed predators of mature fruit, but are less effective at satiating pre-dispersal predators of immature fruit attacking early flowering species.
   Abstrak Pelbagai spesies Dipterocarpaceae serta keluarga tumbuhan lain berbunga serentak di hutan Asia Tenggara dalam jangka masa yang tidak dapat dijangka. Pembungaan umum ini dianggap memudahkan kemandirian biji benih melalui lambakan biji benih yang memenuhi keperluan pemangsa biji benih. Semasa pembungaan besar-besaran ini spesies-spesies Shorea (Dipterocarpaceae) yang bertalian rapat mengeluarkan bunga secara berperingkat dalam beberapa minggu. Hal ini dapat mengurangkan pendebungaan serentak serta persaingan interspesifik untuk pendebunga. Pemangsa umum bagi biji benih yang belum gugur (prapenyebaran) mungkin juga mengesan pokok-pokok yang berbunga dan mempengaruhi keperluan pemangsa. Persoalan kami adalah sama ada pemangsa biji benih berbeza semasa awal atau akhir waktu pembungaan spesies Shorea berdasarkan hasil pemeriksaan intensiti pembungaan, pembuahan serta pemangsa biji benih semasa dua musim pembungaan besar-besaran di hutan penyelidikan Pasoh. Serangga pemangsa biji benih merosakkan sehingga 63% daripada biji benih yang sedang membesar dengan Nanophyes shoreae sebagai kumbang yang paling banyak memakan biji benih yang belum matang bagi semua spesies Shorea. Kumbang ini memberi kesan paling signifikan terhadap biji benih yang belum matang bagi spesies yang berbunga awal. Masa perkembangan larva yang panjang menghalang oviposisi kumbang dewasa yang muncul dari awal pembungaan Shorea hingga akhir pembungaan Shorea. Sebaliknya, larva kumbang yang memakan biji benih matang sebelum penyebaran biji benih (Alcidodes spp.) terdapat dalam setiap biji benih spesies Shorea hampir serentak. Kami simpulkan bahawa kejadian pembungaan besar-besaran berpotensi dalam memenuhi keperluan pemangsa biji benih selepas penyebaran serta prapenyebaran untuk buah-buahan matang, tetapi kurang efektif dalam memenuhi keperluan pemangsa prapenyebaran buah-buahan tidak matang yang menyerang spesies berbunga awal.

AB Patterns of termite richness along elevation gradients may be related to different responses by termite functional groups to changes in environmental conditions. We investigated the distribution of termite species richness along an elevational gradient of cerrado and rupestrian grasslands in the Espinhaco Mountain Range, in Brazil. Fifty termite species were recorded, with the family Termitidae being dominant; 16 species are endemic to open areas of cerrado and 1 species, Cortaritermes rizzinii, is endemic and restricted to mountaintop grassland habitats. Termite richness declined with increasing elevation, with the main factors associated with the reduction being climactic (air temperature, air and soil humidity, and radiation) and vegetation variables. Different termite communities were found along the elevational gradient, which were also strongly influenced by changes in climate and vegetation. On the other hand, the same functional groups were present at the different elevations, although represented by different species.

AB In landscapes dominated by agriculture, conspicuous edges often occur between landscape elements. However, there is disagreement about the existence and intensity of edge effects, and information about species-specific responses remains scarce. Studying such edge effects can help elucidate functional landscape connectivity and contribute to agricultural management. We, therefore, assessed whether sun-grown coffee represents a barrier to dung beetles in an Andean agricultural landscape. We also evaluated whether the response to edge effects differs among species. We found that diversity and abundance tend to decrease from forest to sun-grown coffee and that there are sharp increases in species turnover at the forest-coffee edge. We detected several different species-specific responses to the forest-coffee edge, suggesting differences in the mobility of the species (or spillover) and in the degree of penetration that takes place from forest patches to sun-grown coffee plantations. This study demonstrates that the sun-grown coffee matrix constitutes a barrier to forest species and suggests that the forest-coffee ecotone is more complex than expected. Our results support the notion that the conservation value of native forest patches in agricultural scenarios depends on the functional connectivity of forest units in the landscape to maximize the opportunities species have to disperse through the agricultural matrix.

AB Fragmentation of natural habitats can be detrimental for species if individuals fail to cross habitat boundaries to reach new locations, thereby reducing functional connectivity. Connectivity is crucial for species shifting their ranges under climate change, making it important to understand factors that might prevent movement through human-modified landscapes. In tropical regions, rain forests are being fragmented by agricultural expansion, potentially isolating populations of highly diverse forest-dependent species. The likelihood of crossing habitat boundaries is an important determinant of species dispersal through fragmented landscapes, and so we examined movement across rain forest-oil palm plantation boundaries on Borneo by using relatively mobile nymphalid butterflies as our model study taxon. We marked 1666 individuals from 65 species, and 19 percent (100/527) of recaptured individuals crossed the boundary. Boundary crossing was relatively frequent in some species, and net movement of individuals was from forest into plantation. However, boundary crossing from forest into plantation was detected in less than 50 percent (12/28) of recaptured species and was dominated by small-sized butterfly species whose larval host plants occurred within plantations. Thus, while oil palm plantations may be relatively permeable to some species, they may act as barriers to the movement of forest-dependent species (i.e., species that require rain forest habitat to breed), highlighting the importance of maintaining forest connectivity for conserving rain forest species.
   Abstrak Penyerpihan habitat semulajadi boleh memudaratkan sesuatu spesies jika ianya gagal menyeberangi sempadan bukan habitat bagi mencapai lokasi baharu yang seterusnya boleh mengurangkan fungsi habitat semulajadi hutan yang bersambungan. Habitat yang bersambung adalah penting bagi meningkatkan julat pergerakan spesies ketika perubahan iklim dan oleh itu, adalah amat penting untuk mengetahui faktor-faktor yang mungkin menghalang pergerakan mereka dalam landskap yang telah diubahsuai oleh manusia. Di kawasan tropika, perkembangan pesat pertanian telah menyebabkan banyak hutan hujan semulajadi menjadi habitat yang terserpih, dan ia akan menyebabkan potensi sesuatu spesies yang mempunyai kepelbagaian biologi yang tinggi dan amat bergantung terhadap habitat hutan hujan tersebut menjadi terasing. Kebarangkalian untuk menyeberangi sempadan bukan habitat adalah penting dalam menentukan penyebaran spesies di kawasan landskap hutan hujan yang terserpih dan oleh itu, penyelidikan tentang pergerakan spesies di kawasan hutan hujan dan sempadan ladang kelapa sawit di Borneo dengan menggunakan taksa kupu-kupu famili Nymphalidae sebagai model organisma akan dikaji. Sebanyak 1666 individu dari 65 spesies kupu-kupu telah ditandai dan sebanyak 19 peratus (100/527) adalah individu yang telah melintasi sempadan bukan habitat. Sesetengah spesies kerap melintasi sempadan bukan habitat dan pergerakan mereka adalah dari kawasan hutan hujan ke ladang kelapa sawit. Walaubagaimanapun, penyeberangan sempadan bukan habitat dari hutan ke ladang kelapa sawit bagi spesies kupu-kupu yang berjaya ditangkap semula yang telah dikesan adalah kurang daripada 50 peratus (12/28) dan ianya dikuasai oleh spesies kupu-kupu bersaiz kecil yang mempunyai tumbuhan perumah larva di kawasan ladang kelapa sawit. Secara amnya, ladang kelapa sawit boleh bertindak sebagai penyekat kepada pergerakan sesuatu spesies yang bergantung penuh terhadap habitat hutan hujan (cthnya; spesies yang mempunyai keperluan khusus kepada habitat hutan hujan untuk pembiakan) dan kepentingan untuk memastikan habitat hutan terus bersambung bagi memulihara spesies-spesies hutan hujan wajar ditonjolkan.

AB Species diversity is the variable most commonly studied in recent ecological research. Ecological processes, however, are driven by individuals and affected by their abundances. Understanding the variation in animal abundances along climatic gradients is important for predicting changes in ecosystem processes under global warming. High abundances make arthropods, despite their small body sizes, important actors in food webs, yet abundance distributions of major arthropod taxa along climatic gradients remain poorly documented. We sampled arthropod assemblages in disturbed and undisturbed vegetation types along an elevational gradient of 860-4550m asl on the southern slopes of Mt. Kilimanjaro, Tanzania. In our analysis, we focused on 13 taxa of arthropods that represented three major functional groups: predators, herbivores, and decomposers. Abundance patterns were unimodal for most of the taxa and functional groups, including decomposer arthropods, and most of them peaked at low elevations in lower montane forest. When we assigned beetles to functional groups, however, decomposer beetle abundances declined almost linearly, and abundances of predator beetles (ca. 2400m asl) and herbivore beetles (ca. 3000m asl, undisturbed vegetation) peaked at higher elevations and exhibited unimodal patterns. Temperature, not primary productivity, was the best predictor of abundance for most of the taxa and groups. Disturbance was only of minor importance. Our results revealed different trends in the response of arthropod abundance along the elevational gradient that depended on the level of taxonomic and functional resolution. This highlights the need for more comparisons of different taxa along the same climatic gradients.
   Ufupisho Utofauti wa spishi ni kawaida ilivyoripotiwa katika makala ya hivi karibuni ya utafiti wa ikolojia. Mifumo ya ikolojia, hata hivyo, inaendeshwa na viumbe binafsi. Wingi wa athropoda, licha ya udogo wa maumbo yao huwafanya kuwa watendaji muhimu katika mfumo wa chakula. Uelewa wa tofauti katika wingi wa wanyama katika tabia nchi tofauti ni muhimu kwa ajili ya utabiri wa mabadiliko ya utendaji kazi wa mifumo ikolojia kutokana na ongezeko la joto duniani. Licha ya hili, data kuhusu mgawanyo wa wingi wa arthopoda katika tabia nchi tofauti bado ni chache. Tulikusanya sampuli za athropoda kutoka kwenye maeneo yasio na uoto wa asili na yale yenye uoto wa asili katika mwinuko wa kati ya mita 860 hadi mita 4550 UB kwenye mteremko wa upande kusini wa Mlima Kilimanjaro huko Tanzania. Katika uchambuzi wetu, sisi tulilenga katika aina 13 tofauti za athropoda zinazowakilisha makundi matatu makuu ya kazi: wawindaji, wala mimea na waozeshaji. Aina nyingi zilionyesha mtindo wa aina moja wa wingi, kilele kikiwa katika maeneo ya mwinuko wa chini. Wakati aina zilipopangwa katika makundi ya kazi, wawindaji na waozeshaji walionyesha kilele kidogo katika au chini ya mwinuko wa mita 1500 UB na kupungua katika wingi kwenye miinuko ya juu. Waozeshaji walionyesha kilele tofauti kwenye mita 1500 UB. Tulipowapanga mende-kibyongo kwenye makundi ya kazi, hata hivyo, waozeshaji walipungua kimstari, na wawindaji (mita 2400 UB) na wala mimea (mita 3000 UB, uoto wa asili) walionyesha mtawanyiko wa aina moja, na vilele zaidi juu ya mwinuko. Joto, na si tija msingi, ndio lilikuwa mbashiri bora wa wingi wa aina na makundi. Usumbufu ulikuwa na umuhimu kidogo. Kwa kumalizia, tumeona tofauti katika mwenendo wa wingi wa athropoda katika mwinuko unategemea aina pamoja na kundi la kazi. Hii inaonyesha haja ya kulinganisha zaidi aina mbalimbali kwenye haya mazingira.

AB Estimates of biodiversity and its global patterns are affected by parasite richness and specificity. Despite this, parasite communities are largely neglected in biodiversity estimates, especially in the tropics. We studied the parasites of annual killifish of the genus Nothobranchius that inhabit annually desiccating pools across the African savannah and survive the dry period as developmentally arrested embryos. Their discontinuous, non-overlapping generations make them a unique organism in which to study natural parasite fauna. We investigated the relationship between global (climate and altitude) and local (pool size, vegetation, host density and diversity, and diversity of potential intermediate hosts) environmental factors and the community structure of killifish parasites. We examined metazoan parasites from 21 populations of four host species (Nothobranchius orthonotus, N.furzeri, N.kadleci, and N.pienaari) across a gradient of aridity in Mozambique. Seventeen parasite taxa were recorded, with trematode larval stages (metacercariae) being the most abundant taxa. The parasites recorded were both allogenic (life cycle includes non-aquatic host; predominantly trematodes) and autogenic (cycling only in aquatic hosts; nematodes). The parasite abundance was highest in climatic regions with intermediate aridity, while parasite diversity was associated with local environmental characteristics and positively correlated with fish species diversity and the amount of aquatic vegetation. Our results suggest that parasite communities of sympatric Nothobranchius species are similar and dominated by the larval stages of generalist parasites. Therefore, Nothobranchius serve as important intermediate or paratenic hosts of parasites, with piscivorous birds and predatory fish being their most likely definitive hosts.

AB The large majority of angiosperm species depend on animals for pollination, including many agricultural crops, and plant-pollinator interactions have been extensively studied. However, not all floral visitors actually transfer pollen, and efforts to distinguish true pollinators from mere visitors are particularly scarce among the bat pollination literature. To determine whether Old World bat species are equally effective pollinators in mixed-agricultural areas of southern Thailand, we examined six night-blooming plant taxa and quantified pollinator importance (PI) of seven common nectarivorous bat species. PI was calculated as the product of nightly bat visitation rate (obtained from mist-netting data) and pollen transfer efficiency (estimated from bat pollen loads). We found that PI varied by both bat species and plant species. In general, the nectar-specialist bat species were more important pollinators, yet their order of importance differed across our focal plant species. In addition, PI was dictated more by pollen transfer effectiveness than visitation rate. Our findings highlight the importance of Old World bat pollinators within southern Thailand's mixed-agricultural landscape and illustrate how seemingly similar floral visitors can have very different contributions toward plant pollination success.

AB While natural resource exploration and extraction activity is expanding in the Neotropics, our understanding of wildlife response to such activity is almost non-existent. Primates, which fulfill important ecological roles and face numerous anthropogenic threats, are of particular concern. We studied primate group distribution before, during, and after natural gas pipeline construction in the Peruvian Amazon to investigate whether primates spatially avoid areas of disturbance. We monitored primates on eight transects 20 times per annual sampling period in three consecutive years and analyzed changes in group observations relative to the pipeline right-of-way in a multi-season occupancy modeling framework. Overall primate group encounter rates were low (<half) compared to a nearby protected area. Contrary to expectations, we did not see clear evidence of spatial avoidance of the pipeline area. Although higher overall encounter rates before construction suggested lower primate use of the area during and following construction, this pattern could not be confirmed statistically, and probability of colonization and extinction of transect sections in the occupancy analysis could not be differentiated from zero. These results are probably attributable to a combination of low numbers of primate encounters and high spatial variability in primate use of different transects. This study provides valuable preliminary data and a methodological framework for understanding the response of an ecologically important group of mammals to anthropogenic activity. We encourage other researchers to continue exploring the impacts of natural resource exploration- and extraction-related activities in the tropics, as such activities are likely to have a growing effect on ecosystems.
   Resumen Mientras que las actividades de exploracion y extraccion de recursos naturales se expanden en el Neotropico, nuestro entendimiento de las respuestas de la vida silvestre a dicho tipo de actividades es casi inexistente. Los primates, que cumplen importantes roles ecologicos y enfrentan numerosas amenazas antropogenicas, son un grupo de especial preocupacion. Estudiamos la distribucion de grupos de primates antes, durante y despues de la construccion de un gaseoducto en la Amazonia peruana para investigar si los primates evitan espacialmente las areas de mayor perturbacion, ya sea en el corto o largo plazo. Monitoreamos especies de primates en ocho transectos, 20 veces por ano, durante tres anos consecutivos y analizamos los cambios en las observaciones de los grupos en relacion al derecho de via del gaseoducto bajo un marco teorico de modelos de ocupacion multi-estacional. En general, la tasas de encuentro de los grupos de primates fueron bajas (menos de la mitad) en comparacion a las reportadas para un area protegida cercana, y contrario a lo esperado, no encontramos evidencia clara de evasion espacial del area de impacto a lo largo de los transectos de estudio. A pesar que las altas tasas de encuentro antes de la construccion sugirieron menor uso del area por parte de los primates durante y despues de la construccion, este patron no pudo ser confirmado estadisticamente. Asimismo, la probabilidad de colonizacion y extincion de las secciones de los transectos en el analisis de ocupacion no pudo ser diferenciada de cero. Esto es, probablemente debido a la combinacion de un bajo numero de encuentros de grupos de primates y una alta variabilidad espacial de los primates en el uso de los diferentes transectos. Este estudio provee valiosos datos preliminares y un marco metodologico para comprender las respuestas de un grupo ecologicamente importante de mamiferos Neotropicales a actividades antropogenicas. Invitamos a otros investigadores a continuar explorando los impactos de la construccion de gaseoductos y de otras actividades de exploracion y extraccion de recursos naturales en la flora y fauna tropical ya que dichas actividades pueden incrementar su efecto en los ecosistemas tropicales.

AB Ectomycorrhizal networks may facilitate the establishment and survival of seedlings regenerating under the canopies of tropical forests and are often invoked as a potential contributor to monodominance. We identified ectomycorrhizal fungi in a monodominant Gilbertiodendron dewevrei (Fabaceae) rain forest in Cameroon, using sporocarps and ectomycorrhizae of three age categories (seedlings, intermediate trees, and large trees) and tentatively revealed nutrient transfer through ectomycorrhizal networks by measuring spontaneous isotopic (C-13 and N-15) abundances in seedlings. Sporocarp surveys revealed fewer ectomycorrhizal fungal taxa (59 species from 1030 sporocarps) than molecular barcoding of ectomycorrhizal roots (75 operational taxonomic units from 828 ectomycorrhizae). Our observations suggest that ectomycorrhizal fungal diversity is similar to that in other mixed tropical forests and provide the first report of the Tuber-Helvella lineage in a tropical forest. Despite some differences, all age categories of G.dewevrei had overlapping ectomycorrhizal fungal communities, with families belonging to Thelephoraceae, Russulaceae, Sebacinaceae, Boletaceae, and Clavulinaceae. Of the 49 operational taxonomic units shared by the three age categories (65.3% of the ectomycorrhizal fungal community), 19 were the most abundant on root tips of all categories (38.7% of the shared taxa), supporting the likelihood of ectomycorrhizal networks. However, we obtained no evidence for nutrient transfer from trees to seedlings. We discuss the composition of the ectomycorrhizal fungal community among the G.dewevrei age categories and the possible role of common ectomycorrhizal networks in this rain forest.
   Resume Les reseaux mycorhiziens pourraient faciliter l'etablissement et la survie des semis sous la canopee des forets tropicales, en particulier dans les forets monodominantes. Pour etudier ce mecanisme, des champignons ont ete identifies a partir de sporophores et d'ectomycorhizes sur trois categories d'age (semis, arbres intermediaires, arbres adultes) et leur role potentiel dans le transfert de nutriments au benefice des semis a ete teste par des mesures de teneurs isotopiques spontanees (C-13 et N-15) dans une foret monodominante a Gilbertiodendron dewevrei (Fabaceae) du Cameroun. Les sporophores ont ete moins diversifies (59 especes parmi 1030 sporophores) que les ectomycorhizes (75 unites taxonomiques operationnelles parmi 828 ectomycorhizes). La diversite fongique ne differe pas de celle des forets tropicales mixtes. Nous decrivons la lignee Tuber-Helvella pour la premiere fois en foret tropicale. Malgre des differences, les categories d'age, G.dewevrei, partagent des especes de Thelephoraceae, Russulaceae, Sebacinaceae, Boletaceae et Clavulinaceae. Parmi les 49 unites taxonomiques operationnelles (65,3% de la communaute fongique) partages par les trois categories d'age, 19 d'entre eux (38,7% de la communaute fongique partagee) formeraient un reseau mycorhizien commun entre les arbres et les semis. Toutefois, les approches isotopiques n'ont pas permis de detecter de transfert de nutriments des arbres aux semis. Nous discutons la composition et le role des communautes fongiques des trois categories d'age de G.dewevrei dans cette foret tropicale humide.

AB South African coastal forests form part of two critically endangered eco-regions and harbor an extinction debt. Remaining fragments are small, isolated, and embedded within a range of human land-use types. In this study, we ask: how should we invest conservation resources if we want to restore this landscape and prevent predicted extinctions? To answer this question, we use path analyses to determine the direct and indirect effects of forest area, forest connectivity, and matrix land-use types on species richness within five bird feeding guilds. We found that forest connectivity had a significant direct effect on insectivoresfragments that were more connected had more species of insectivores than those that were isolated. Moreover, forest area had a significant indirect effect on insectivores that was mediated through tree species richness. Larger fragments had more species of trees, which led to more species of insectivores. Fragment area, connectivity, matrix land-use type, and tree species richness had no significant effects on the species richness of frugivores, nectarivores, granivores, or generalist feeders. To conserve insectivores in coastal forests, conservation efforts should focus on maximizing fragment connectivity across the landscape, but also protect the tree community within fragments from degradation. This can be achieved by including matrix habitats that adjoin forest fragments within forest conservation and restoration plans. Natural matrix habitats can increase connectivity, provide supplementary resources, buffer fragments from degradation, and could play an important role in safeguarding diversity and preventing extinctions in this threatened human-modified landscape.

AB Neotropical poison frogs sequester alkaloid-based chemical defenses from their diet, which seem to repel invertebrate predators after contact. In this study, we tested the reaction of predatory ants toward skin secretions of captive-bred poison frogs without alkaloids. Although the secretions had a smell and taste similar to those of wild-caught frogs, the ants did not avoid them, but actually preferred them. We infer that amphibian secretions are attractive to invertebrate predators (probably due to palatable nutritive components), but that this attraction is overridden when unpalatable alkaloids are present.

AB For over three decades, the Johansson zones have been widely used in epiphyte studies as a way of stratifying the host tree into habitat zones. The usefulness of this system, however, has been questioned. We test the effectiveness of the Johansson zones by grouping epiphyte species by the substrate and microclimatic attributes of their individual occurrences and assessing the fidelity of these groups to the Johansson zones. Habitat characteristics were recorded for every individual epiphyte on 30 trees in the lower montane rain forests of northeastern Australia. Twenty-four epiphyte species were agglomerated into four groups using Ward's method. Group 4 was highly distinct and included shade-loving species and nomadic vines from the lower zones of the host trees. Group 3 contained species from the most exposed habitats. Group 1 had higher light levels and lower substrate thickness than Group 2, yet both groups had close to identical distributions over the Johansson zones. This suggests that groups of epiphyte species may utilize different micro-sites within the same zone. While the Johansson zones are a useful tool in epiphyte studies, finer partitioning of habitat within the host tree may be missed.

AB Most terrestrial species on Earth are ectothermic and track temperature at small spatial scales, from sun flecks to cool shaded spots. Current assessments of thermal heterogeneity in complex environments are predominately characterized by ambient temperature. This omission of solar radiation may lead to inaccurate conclusions regarding thermoregulation and distribution of species. We use thermal cameras to gather data on temperature heterogeneity in structurally complex rain forest environments. Using thermographic photographs, we capture the multidimensionality of climate created by vegetation by collecting over 76,000 temperature samples within approximately 1m(2) quadrats. The method was tested against three standard methods that record air temperature to determine possible omissions in capturing thermal heterogeneity in four geographic locationsColombia, Borneo, Madagascar, and Australia. Across all locations, there was greater thermal heterogeneity in surface temperature than captured from ambient temperature technologies. Spatial variability in surface temperature on 1d was greater than temporal variability of ambient temperature across the entire month, with extreme deviation from ambient temperatures. Importantly, when compared to the lower bounds for optimal performance for five tropical Anolis species, this technology captured thermal regimes that support the thermoregulatory needs of these species, whereas ambient air temperature methods suggested that these species would be in thermal debt. Sampling surface temperature at high resolutions across space in combination with intensive sampling of ambient temperature and informed spatial modeling should improve our understanding of the distribution of ectothermic species living within thermally heterogeneous environments.
   Resume Sur Terre, la plupart des especes terrestres sont ectothermiques et traquent la temperature dans une petite echelle spatiale, depuis les spots de soleil jusqu'aux frais spots ombreux. Les evaluations courantes a propos de l'heterogeneite thermique dans les environnements complexes sont caracterisees principalement par la temperature ambiante. Cette omission de la radiation solaire pourrait conduire a des conclusions inexactes concernant la thermoregulation et la distribution des especes. Nous utilisons des cameras thermiques en vue d'accumuler des donnees sur l'heterogeneite de la temperature dans un environnement structurellement complexe de la foret humide. En utilisant des photos thermographiques, nous capturons la multi dimensionnalite du climat cree par la vegetation en collectant plus de 76.000 echantillons de photos avec approximativement 1m(2) quadrats. La methode a ete testee contre trois methodes standards qui enregistrent la temperature de l'air afin de determiner les omissions possibles de capture de l'heterogeneite thermique dans quatre sites__ Colombie, Borneo, Madagascar et Australie. A travers tous ces sites, il y a une plus grande heterogeneite thermique sur la temperature de la surface que ceux captures par les technologies de temperature ambiante. La variabilite spatiale sur la temperature de la surface en un jour fut plus grande que la variabilite temporelle de la temperature ambiante tout au long du mois avec une extreme deviation venant des temperatures ambiantes. Plus important encore, quand ceci est compare a la plus basse limite de la performance optimale de cinq especes d'Anolis tropicaux, cette technologie captura des regimes thermaux qui supportent les besoins thermoregulateurs de ces especes tandis que la methode de la temperature de l'air ambiante suggere que ces especes devraient soumise a une dette thermique. La collecte de la temperature de la surface a haute resolution a travers l'espace combine avec la collecte intensive de la temperature ambiante dans le temps et la modelisation spatiale informee devrait ameliorer notre comprehension sur la distribution des especes ectothermiques vivant dans un environnement thermiquement heterogene.

AB Habitat loss is the main driver of the current high rate of species extinction, particularly in tropical forests. Understanding the factors associated with biodiversity loss, such as the extinction of species interactions and ecological functions, is an urgent priority. Here, our aim was to evaluate how landscape-scale forest cover influences fruit biomass comparing different tree functional groups. We sampled 20 forest fragments located within landscapes with forest cover ranging from 2 to 93 percent in the Atlantic forest of southern Bahia, Brazil. In each fragment, we established five plots of 25x4m and carried out phenological observations on fleshy fruit throughout 1year on all trees 5cm dbh. We estimated fruit availability by direct counting of all fruits and derived fruit biomass from this count. We used spatial mixed linear models to evaluate the effects of forest cover on species richness, abundance, and fruit biomass. Our results indicated that forest cover was the main explanatory variable and negatively influenced the total richness and abundance of zoochoric and shade-tolerant but not shade-intolerant species. A linear model best explained variations in richness and abundance of total and shade-tolerant species. We also found that forest cover was positively correlated with the fruit biomass produced by all species and by the shade-tolerant assemblages, with linear models best explaining both relationships. The loss of shade-tolerant species and the lower fruit production in fragments with lower landscape-scale forest cover may have implications for the maintenance of frugivore, seed dispersal service, and plant recruitment.
   Resumo A perda de habitat e a principal responsavel pelas elevadas taxas atuais de extincAo de especies, particularmente em florestas tropicais. A compreensAo dos fatores associados a perda de biodiversidade, como extincAo de interacoes entre especies e funcoes ecologicas, e uma prioridade urgente. Aqui, o nosso objetivo foi avaliar como a cobertura florestal em escala de paisagem influencia a disponibilidade de biomassa dos frutos comparando diferentes grupos funcionais de arvores. Para atingir esse objetivo, foram amostrados 20 fragmentos florestais localizados em paisagens com cobertura florestal variando entre 2 a 93 por cento na Floresta Atlantica do sul da Bahia. Em cada fragmento, foram estabelecidas cinco parcelas de 25x4m e realizadas observacoes fenologicas em frutos carnosos durante um ano em todas as arvores com DAP 5cm. A disponibilidade de frutos foi estimada por contagem direta de todos os frutos e calculando a biomassa produzida. Foram utilizados modelos lineares mistos espaciais para avaliar os efeitos da cobertura florestal na riqueza de especies, abundancia e biomassa de frutos. Nossos principais resultados indicaram que a cobertura florestal foi a principal variavel explanatoria e que a mesma influencia negativamente a riqueza e abundancia de especies zoocoricas e tolerantes ao sombreamento, mas nAo as especies intolerantes. O modelo linear explica melhor variacoes na riqueza e abundancia total e das especies tolerantes. Foi encontrado tambem que a cobertura florestal foi positivamente correlacionada com a biomassa de frutos produzidos por todas as especies e pelas assembleias de tolerantes, e o modelo linear explica melhor ambas as relacoes. A perda de especies tolerantes e a menor producAo de biomassa de frutos carnosos em fragmentos com cobertura florestal inferior na paisagem podem ter implicacoes para a manutencAo em comunidades de frugivoros, servicos de dispersAo de sementes e recrutamento de plantas.

AB Columnar cacti constitute the dominant elements in the vegetation structure of arid and semi-arid New World ecosystems representing a plethora of food resources for vertebrate consumers. Previous stable isotope analysis in Central Mexico showed that columnar cacti are of low importance to build tissue for frugivorous bats. We used carbon stable isotope analysis of whole blood and breath samples collected from four species of frugivorous bats (Sturnira parvidens, Sturnira ludovici, Artibeus jamaicensis, and Artibeus intermedius) to reconstruct the importance of cactus plants in their diet. Breath samples were collected within 10min (B-10) of bat capture and 12h after capture (B-720), representing the oxidation of recently ingested food and of body reserves, respectively. We expected that bats relied primarily on non-cactus food to construct tissues and fuel oxidative metabolism. Non-cactus food strongly predominated for tissue building, whereas oxidative metabolism was supported by a moderate preponderance of non-cactus food for B-10 samples, and a moderate preponderance of cactus food or an equal contribution of both sources for B-720 samples. Artibeus and Surnira species appear to cover a narrow part of the diet with cactus food, confirming that the incorporation of nutrients derived from these plants is not generalized among vertebrate consumers.
   Resumen Los cactus columnares son los elementos dominantes de la estructura de la vegetacion en los ecosistemas aridos y semiaridos del Nuevo Mundo, y son una fuente de recursos alimentarios importante para los vertebrados. Estudios previos usando el analisis de isotopos estables en el centro de Mexico demuestran que los cactus columnares son de baja importancia para los murcielagos frugivoros como fuente de nutrientes para construir tejidos. En este estudio usamos el analisis de isotopos estables de carbono en muestras de sangre y aliento colectadas de cuatro especies de murcielagos frugivoros (Sturnira parvidens, Sturnira ludovici, Artibeus jamaicensis y Artibeus intermedius) para reconstruir la importancia de estas plantas en su alimentacion. Las muestras de aliento fueron colectadas 10 minutos (B-10) y 12 horas (B-720) despues de la captura de cada murcielago, y representan la oxidacion de alimento recientemente ingerido y de las reservas corporales del animal, respectivamente. Se esperaba que los cactus columnares contribuyeran marginalmente como fuente de nutrientes para construir tejidos y sustentar el metabolismo oxidativo. Se encontro que la construccion de tejidos se derivo predominantemente de fuentes de alimento distintas a los cactus. La contribucion de los cactus columnares para subsidiar el metabolismo oxidativo fue baja en las muestras B-10 y moderada en las muestras B-720. Los los cactus columnares parecen contribuir de forma limitada a la alimentacion de las especies de murcielagos estudiadas, confirmando que su importancia para los consumidores vertebrados no es generalizada.

AB The effects of producer diversity on predators have received little attention in arboreal plant communities, particularly in the tropics. This is particularly true in the case of tree diversity effects on web-building spiders, one of the most important groups of invertebrate predators in terrestrial plant communities. We evaluated the effects of tree species diversity on the community of weaver spiders associated with big-leaf mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla) in 19, 21x21-m plots (64plants/plot) of a tropical forest plantation which were either mahogany monocultures (12plots) or polycultures (seven plots) that included mahogany and three other tree species. We conducted two surveys of weaver spiders on mahogany trees to evaluate the effects of tree diversity on spider abundance, species richness, diversity, and species composition associated with mahogany. Our results indicated that tree species mixtures exhibited significantly greater spider abundance, species richness, and diversity, as well as differences in spider species composition relative to monocultures. These results could be due to species polycultures providing a broader range of microhabitat conditions favoring spider species with different habitat requirements, a greater availability of web-building sites, or due to increased diversity or abundance of prey. Accordingly, these results emphasize the importance of mixed forest plantations for boosting predator abundance and diversity and potentially enhancing herbivore pest suppression. Future work is necessary to determine the specific mechanisms underlying these patterns as well as the top-down effects of increased spider abundance and species richness on herbivore abundance and damage.
   Resumen El efecto de la diversidad de plantas sobre depredadores ha recibido poca atencion en comunidades de plantas arboreas. Esto es especialmente cierto para el caso del efecto de la diversidad de arboles en aranas tejedoras, uno de los grupos de invertebrados depredadores mas importantes en comunidades terrestres. Evaluamos los efectos de la diversidad de especies arboreas sobre la comunidad de la caoba (Swietenia macrophylla) en un experimento de diversidad forestal consistente en 74 parcelas de 21x21-mts (64 plantas/parcela). Muestreamos 19 de las parcelas clasificadas como monocultivos de caoba y policultivos de otras cuatro especies (incluyendo caoba); se muestrearon en dos ocasiones a las aranas tejedoras sobre los arboles de caoba para evaluar los efectos de la diversidad de arboles en la abundancia, riqueza, diversidad y composicion de especies de las aranas tejedoras. Nuestros resultados mostraron que los policultivos tuvieron una diversidad, abundancia y riqueza de aranas significativamente mayor que los monocultivos. Mas aun, encontramos evidencias de que el efecto de la diversidad de especies de arboles sobre la riqueza de especies de aranas estuvo mediado por el incremento en la abundancia de aranas en los policultivos. Estos resultados podrian deberse a que los policultivos proveen de un rango mas amplio de condiciones del microhabitat que favorecen a especies de aranas con diferentes requerimientos ambientales o una mayor disponibilidad de sitios para la construccion de telaranas. En estudios futuros es necesario determinar los mecanismos especificos subyacentes que explican estos patrones asi como los efectos de arriba hacia abajo del incremento de la abundancia de aranas en la riqueza y abundancia de herbivoros y en el dano que estos provocan en las plantas.

AB The availability of fruits is critical for tropical forests, where the majority of plant species rely upon animal vectors for seed dispersal. However, we do not know how fruit production is temporally distributed over species and families. Two plant families are particularly important in floristic inventories of Atlantic rain forests: Arecaceae, a few species of which are highly abundant; and Myrtaceae, which is abundant and displays outstanding species diversity. In this context, we asked whether hyperdominance occurs in fruit production in the Atlantic rain forest, and whether it occurs in the abundant species of Arecaceae and Myrtaceae. We investigated whether the temporal fruit production patterns differ between Myrtaceae, Arecaceae, and the plant community as a whole. We also applied a functional dispersion index to assess the temporal fruit diversity over a 2-yr period, with regard to morphological and phenological traits. We found that the phenomenon of hyperdominance occurs in fruit production: five species accounted for more than half of the pulp biomass. Arecaceae fruit biomass peaked at the end of wet season, overlapping with the community peak; whereas Myrtaceae species fruited throughout the year and were an important resource during periods of food scarcity. Myrtaceae filled more of the fruit morphospace over time because their fruits exhibit a large range of morphologies and phenological strategies. Our results demonstrated the importance of combining phenology and fruit morphology in the evaluation of resource availability, which revealed periods of high fruit diversity that could support a range of frugivore sizes and maintain overall ecosystem functionality.
   Resumo A disponibilidade de frutos e critica para as florestas tropicais onde a maioria das plantas depende dos animais como vetores para a dispersAo de suas sementes. Porem, nos nAo sabemos como a producAo de frutos esta temporalmente distribuida nas especies e familias. Duas familias de plantas sAo particularmente importantes nos levantamentos floristicos da floresta Atlantica: Arecaceae devido a alta abundancia de poucas especies e Myrtaceae devido a elevada abundancia e grande diversidade de especies. Neste contexto, nos perguntamos se existe hiperdominancia na producAo de frutos em Floresta Atlantica e se ela ocorre nas especies abundantes de Myrtaceae e Arecaceae. Nos investigamos se os padroes temporais de producAo de frutos diferem entre Myrtaceae, Arecaceae e o restante da comunidade de plantas. Nos tambem aplicamos um indice de dispersAo funcional, que combina caracteristicas morfologicas dos frutos e fenologia da frutificacAo, para avaliar a diversidade temporal de frutos produzida ao longo de um periodo de dois anos. Nos encontramos que o fenomeno de hiperdominancia ocorre na producAo de frutos: cinco especies foram responsaveis por mais da metade da biomassa de polpa produzida. O pico da biomassa de frutos de Arecaceae ocorreu no final da estacAo umida, sobrepondo com o pico da comunidade; ao passo que Myrtaceae frutificou durante ano todo e foi um importante recurso nos periodos de escassez de alimento. Myrtaceae preencheu mais o morfo-espaco dos frutos ao longo do tempo, porque seus frutos exibem uma maior variacAo morfologica e diversas estrategias fenologicas. Nossos resultados demonstraram a importancia de combinar caracteres fenologicos e morfologicos dos frutos na avaliacAo da disponibilidade de recursos. Essa abordagem permite identificar periodos de alta diversidade funcional de frutos que poderiam sustentar frugivoros de diversos tamanhos e manter a funcionalidade global do ecossistema.

AB Extrafloral nectar (EFN) mediates food-for-protection mutualisms between plants and ants. Such mutualisms exist within a complex web of biotic interactions, and in a framework provided by the abiotic environment. Both biotic and abiotic factors, therefore, affect the outcome of ant-plant interactions. We conducted an experiment to determine the effects of ant activity, and light intensity, on herbivory rates, growth, and reproductive fitness in Senna mexicana var. chapmanii, a perennial legume native to pine rockland habitats of south Florida. Forty plants were divided among four treatments in a factorial experimental design with two independent variables: ant activity and light intensity. Plants were divided equally between sunny and shady habitats, and ants were excluded from half of the plants in each habitat type. The presence of ants significantly reduced herbivory rates in S.chapmanii. In shaded habitats, the presence of ants had no effect on plant reproductive fitness, however, in sunny habitats plants with ants produced significantly more seeds over the duration of the 1-yr study. Ants represent an important biotic defense against herbivores in S.chapmanii; however, their effects on plant fitness are dependent on light conditions. Pine rockland habitats in south Florida have been widely destroyed or mismanaged. In fragments that remain, suppression of fire has led to increased canopy closure and shading of the understory. These changes will likely negatively impact plants that rely on ants for defense. We highlight the importance of conservation efforts to preserve the pine rocklands and the fire regimes on which they rely.

AB Cursorial central-place foragers like ants are expected to minimize travel costs by choosing the least resistive pathways to food resources. Tropical arboreal and semi-arboreal ants locomote over a variety of plant surfaces, and their choice of pathways is selective. We measured the roughness of tree trunk and liana stem surfaces using laser scanning technology, and explored its consequences for running speed in various ant taxa. The average amplitude of tree trunk surface roughness differed interspecifically, and ranged from 1.4-2.2mm among three common tree species (Anacardium excelsum, Alseis blackiana, and Dipteryx panamensis). The roughness of liana stems also varied interspecifically (among Tontelea ovalifolia, Bauhinia sp. and Paullinia sp.) and was an order of magnitude lower than tree surface roughness (mean amplitude ranged 0.09-0.19mm). Field observations of various ant species foraging on tree trunks and liana stems, and on dowels covered with sandpaper, showed that their running speed declined with increasing amplitude of roughness. The effect of roughness on running speed was strongest for mid-sized ants (Azteca trigona and Dolichoderus bispinosus). The accumulation rate of ants at baits did not vary with tree surface roughness, but was significantly lower on moss-covered versus moss-free bark. Collectively, these results indicate that the quality of plant substrates can influence the foraging patterns of arboreal ants, but likely is more important for resource discovery than for dominance on bare tree surfaces.

AB Honey represents a highly nutritious resource for animals, but is difficult to obtain given bees' defensive strategies. We investigated exploitation of the underground nests of stingless bees (Meliplebeia lendliana) by three sympatric consumers in Loango National Park, Gabon: the central African chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes troglodytes), forest elephant (Loxodonta cyclotis) and honey badger (Mellivora capensis). Given the differences in their respective morphological traits and sensory abilities, we hypothesized that chimpanzees would be more limited in digging out the bee nests, compared to the other two competitors, and would show behavioral strategies to overcome such constraints. Our dataset comprised camera trap footage recorded over 60mo at 100 different bee nests. Chimpanzees visited the nests more often than the other consumers, showing a frequency of extraction success comparable to that observed in honey badgers, the most efficient digger. Both chimpanzees and honey badgers increased their extractive attempts across the dry season, whereas elephants did not. The soil hardness was greater during the dry season than the wet season and, possibly in order to compensate for this, chimpanzees showed a tendency toward digging at nests found in relatively softer soil. They also seemed to be inhibited by indirect cues left by other consumers, possibly as a risk-avoidance strategy. Overall, chimpanzees and honey badgers extracted the underground nests of stingless bees with similar frequencies, whilst forest elephants did so only occasionally. Moreover, chimpanzees can use tools and other behavioral strategies to overcome the physical limitations that may constrain their exploitation of this resource.

AB One of the major uncertainties of 21st century climate change is the potential for shifts to the intensity and frequency of the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle. Although this phenomenon is known to have dramatic impacts on ecosystems regionally and globally, the biological consequences of climate change-driven shifts in future ENSO events have been unexplored. Here, we investigate the potential impacts that a persistent El Nino, La Nina, or Neutral' phase may have on species distributions. Using MaxEnt, we model the distribution of climatically suitable habitat for three northeast Australian butterfly subspecies (Doleschallia bisaltide australis, Hypolimnas alimena lamina, and Mycalesis terminus terminus) across the three ENSO phases. We find that the spatial extent and quality of habitat are lowest under conditions that would characterize a persistent El Nino (hot/dry). In contrast, suitable habitat is broadest under the warm/wet conditions associated with La Nina. Statistical analyses of the difference between pair-wise combinations of suitability maps using Hellinger distance showed that projections for each subspecies and ENSO phase combination were significantly different from other combinations. The resilience of these, and other, butterfly (sub)species to changes in ENSO will be influenced by fluctuations in the strength of these events, availability of refugia, and life-history characteristics. However, the population dynamics of wet- and dry-season phenotypes of M. t. terminus and physiological limitations to high temperatures suggest that this subspecies, in particular, may have limited resilience should the strength and frequency of El Nino events increase.

AB Some studies have suggested that non-native species invasions may threaten local diversity by creating homogenized environments. However, many studies have been based on limited or anecdotal data, and/or have failed to consider the influence of habitat modification together with possible influences of non-native species on native ones. Hemidactylus mabouia (Squamata, Gekkonidae) likely invaded natural environments in Brazil hundreds of years ago. Yet, little is known about whether it affects native lizard fauna. We tested whether H.mabouia negatively influences native lizard species richness and abundance on a regional scale and locally through niche overlap. We analyzed species abundance and richness of nine lizard assemblages, in five of which H. mabouia occurred. We evaluated niche overlap of species in a lizard assemblage with high H. mabouia abundance through null models. Niche axes included spatial use, temporal activity and diet. Although species abundance did not differ among sites with and without the invasive species, the presence of H. mabouia seems constrained to the richer assemblages sampled. We observed significantly higher niche overlap in spatial (?(obs)=0.63; ?(exp)=0.37; PobsPexp=0.0002) and trophic axes (?(obs)=0.46; ?(exp)=0.17; PobsPexp<0.001), but not in activity. When we considered all axes (three-dimensional niche), there was no overlapping among the lizard species. Our findings did not support the hypothesis that this non-native species negatively influences other sympatric lizard species.
   RESUMO Estudos sugerem que a invasAo de especies nAo-nativas (NIS) e uma ameaca a diversidade local, principalmente devido ao processo de homogeneizacAo da biota. Outros relatam que a maioria dos autores baseou seus resultados em dados anedotais ou limitados, e/ou nAo incluiram a influencia da modificacAo do habitat com a possivel influencia de NIS sobre as nativas. A invasAo de Hemidactylus mabouia (Squamata, Gekkonidae) em ambientes naturais brasileiros provavelmente data algumas centenas de anos. Entretanto, pouco sabemos se influencia a fauna nativa de lagartos, e qual a magnitude do seu efeito. Testamos se H. mabouia influencia negativamente as especies nativas de lagartos, considerando riqueza e abundancia em escala regional, e a sobreposicAo de nicho em escala local. Analisamos a riqueza e a abundancia de especies de nove assembleias de lagartos, cinco delas com H. mabouia. Avaliamos a sobreposicAo de nicho das especies em uma assembleia com maior abundancia de H. mabouia atraves de modelos nulos, utilizando os eixos espacial, temporal e trofico. NAo houve diferenca significativa entre a abundancia de especies entre localidades com e sem a NIS, mas sua presenca parece restrita as assembleias mais ricas. Observamos sobreposicAo de nicho significativamente maior nos eixos espacial (?(obs)=0.63; ?(exp)=0.37; PobsPexp=0.0002) e trofico (?(obs)=0.46; ?(exp)=0.17; PobsPexp<0.001), mas nAo na atividade. Quando consideramos todos os eixos (nicho tridimensional) nAo houve sobreposicAo entre as especies. Nossos resultados nAo suportam a hipotese de que essa NIS influencia negativamente as outras especies simpatricas.

AB Several recent studies suggest local adaptation in multiple taxa across Hawaii's steep environmental gradients. Restoration efforts in devastated tropical island ecosystems may be deficient if we lack an understanding of the interactions and dependencies in communities that occur along these gradients. Endangered Hawaiian tree snails are part of a snail-epiphyte-plant system where they graze fungi and other microbes on the leaf surface, a process difficult to observe using conventional techniques. Tree snails have undergone catastrophic decline due to introduced predators, removal by shell collectors, and human-influenced habitat degradation. Prior to this study, little was known about the relationship among tree-snails, their host plants, and the epiphytic microbes on which they feed. In this study, we identified scale-dependent selection of substrates in Achatinella sowerbyana and Achatinella lila across the species' ranges. We assessed: (1) within-plant diet selection using high-throughput DNA sequencing (micro-scale); (2) among-plant selection of tree host species (small-scale); (3) and the influence of climate on this system (macro-scale). Selection of substrates occurred at two scales: fungal communities in fecal samples differed in composition from those available on leaf surfaces; and at all sites, snail occurrence on Metrosideros polymorpha, a foundational forest plant, was significantly higher than expected based on availability. Habitat restoration efforts should focus on out-planting of M. polymorpha, the preferred snail host tree, in degraded habitat. Fungal differences across sites suggest relocation efforts to predator-free enclosures may be hindered by microbial shifts associated with geographic distance or differing environments.

AB Large-scale and long-term restoration efforts are urgently needed to reverse historical global trends of deforestation and forest degradation in the tropics. Restoration of forests within landscapes offers multiple social, economic, and environmental benefits that enhance lives of local people, mitigate effects of climate change, increase food security, and safeguard soil and water resources. Despite rapidly growing knowledge regarding the extent and feasibility of natural regeneration and the environmental and economic benefits of naturally regenerating forests in the tropics, tree planting remains the major focus of restoration programs. Natural regeneration is often ignored as a viable land-use option. Here, we assemble a set of 16 original papers that provide an overview of the ecological, economic, and social dimensions of forest and landscape restoration (FLR), a relatively new approach to forest restoration that aims to regain ecological integrity and enhance human well-being in deforested or degraded forest landscapes. The papers describe how spontaneous (passive) and assisted natural regeneration can contribute to achieving multiple social and ecological benefits. Forest and landscape restoration is centered on the people who live and work in the landscape and whose livelihoods will benefit and diversify through restoration activities inside and outside of farms. Given the scale of degraded forestland and the need to mitigate climate change and meet human development needs in the tropics, harnessing the potential of natural regeneration will play an essential role in achieving the ambitious goals that motivate global restoration initiatives.

AB A major global effort to enable cost-effective natural regeneration is needed to achieve ambitious forest and landscape restoration goals. Natural forest regeneration can potentially play a major role in large-scale landscape restoration in tropical regions. Here, we focus on the conditions that favor natural regeneration within tropical forest landscapes. We illustrate cases where large-scale natural regeneration followed forest clearing and non-forest land use, and describe the social and ecological factors that drove these local forest transitions. The self-organizing processes that create naturally regenerating forests and natural regeneration in planted forests promote local genetic adaptation, foster native species with known traditional uses, create spatial and temporal heterogeneity, and sustain local biodiversity and biotic interactions. These features confer greater ecosystem resilience in the face of future shocks and disturbances. We discuss economic, social, and legal issues that challenge natural regeneration in tropical landscapes. We conclude by suggesting ways to enable natural regeneration to become an effective tool for implementing large-scale forest and landscape restoration. Major research and policy priorities include: identifying and modeling the ecological and economic conditions where natural regeneration is a viable and favorable land-use option, developing monitoring protocols for natural regeneration that can be carried out by local communities, and developing enabling incentives, governance structures, and regulatory conditions that promote the stewardship of naturally regenerating forests. Aligning restoration goals and practices with natural regeneration can achieve the best possible outcome for achieving multiple social and environmental benefits at minimal cost.

AB Forests are sources of wood, non-timber forest products and ecosystems services and goods that benefit society as a whole, and are especially important to rural livelihoods. Forest landscape restoration (FLR) has been proposed as a way to counteract deforestation and reconcile the production of ecosystem services and goods with conservation and development goals. But limited evidence indicates how large-scale forest restoration could contribute to improving local livelihoods. Here, we present a conceptual framework to analyze the effects of large-scale restoration on local livelihoods, and use it to review the scientific literature and reduce this knowledge gap. Most of the literature referred to case studies (89%), largely concentrated in China (49%). The main theme explored was income, followed by livelihoods diversification, off-farm employment opportunities, poverty reduction, equity and the provision of timber and energy as ecosystem services. Nearly 60 percent of the papers discussed the importance of governance systems to socioeconomic outcomes. The reforestation/restoration programs and policies investigated in the studies had mixed socioeconomic effects on local livelihoods depending on other variables, such as availability of off-farm jobs, household characteristics, land productivity, land tenure, and markets for forest products and ecosystem services. We conclude that the effects of large-scale restoration initiatives on local livelihoods may vary due to several factors and is still not clear for many situations; therefore, monitoring over time with clear indicators is needed.

AB In human-modified tropical landscapes (HMLs) the conservation of biodiversity, functions and services of forest ecosystems depends on persistence of old growth forest remnants, forest regeneration in abandoned agricultural fields, and restoration of degraded lands. Understanding the impacts of agricultural land uses (ALUs) on forest regeneration is critical for biodiversity conservation in HMLs. Here, we develop a conceptual framework that considers the availability of propagules and the environment prevailing after field abandonment as two major determinants of forest regeneration in HMLs. The framework proposes that regeneration potential decreases with size, duration and severity of agricultural disturbance, reducing propagule availability and creating ill-suited environmental conditions for regeneration. We used studies from Southern Mexico to assess this framework. First, we identify regeneration bottlenecks that trees face during transit from seed to follow-up life stages, using demographic analysis of dominant pioneer species in recently abandoned fields. Then, we explore effects of ALUs on forest regeneration at the field and landscape scales, addressing major legacies. Finally, we integrate agricultural disturbance with landscape composition to predict attributes of successful second growth forests in HMLs, and provide indicators useful to select tree native species for active restoration. An indicator of disturbance inflicted by ALUs, based on farmers' information, predicted better regeneration potential than measurements of soil and microclimate conditions at time of abandonment. Cover of cattle pastures in the landscape was a stronger indicator of forest regenerating attributes than cover of old growth forest remnants. To conclude, we offer recommendations to promote forest regeneration and biodiversity conservation in HMLs.

AB Seedlings play an important role in the processes of plant community succession. We compared seedling (dbh < 1 cm) species composition and diversity over a chronosequence (18-, 30-, 60-year-old second growth and old growth forest) after shifting cultivation in a tropical lowland rain forest area on Hainan Island, China. Seedling diversity reached a maximum in the 60-year-old second growth forest, which is consistent with the intermediate disturbance hypothesis. With the progression of secondary succession, canopy openness (CO), soil organic matter, soil phosphorus content, and tree abundance showed a general decreasing trend; soil water content and tree basal area showed a general trend of increase, while soil pH and other nutrients reached maximum values and tree richness reached a minimum value at intermediate stages of succession. Seedling composition and diversity were significantly affected by soil water, pH, soil nutrient content, and biotic factors in the 18-year-old second growth forests; by soil pH, soil nutrient content, and biotic factors in the 30-year-old second growth forests; by CO, soil nutrient content and tree abundance in the 60-year-old second growth forests; and by CO, soil pH, and soil nutrient content in the old growth forests. At earlier stages of succession, the effect of the proportion of old growth forest in the surrounding landscape on seedling diversity was greater than that of land-use history, but the importance of these drivers was reversed at later stages of succession.

AB Tropical landscapes are changing rapidly as a result of human modifications; however, despite increasing deforestation, human population growth, and the need for more agricultural land, deforestation rates have exceeded the rate at which land is converted to cropland or pasture. For deforested lands to have conservation value requires an understanding of regeneration rates of vegetation, the rates at which animals colonize and grow in regenerating areas, and the nature of interactions between plants and animals in the specific region. Here, we present data on forest regeneration and animal abundance at four regenerating sites that had reached the stage of closed canopy forest where the average dbh of the trees was 17 cm. Overall, 20.3 percent of stems were wind-dispersed species and 79.7 percent were animal-dispersed species, while in the old-growth forest 17.3 percent of the stems were wind-dispersed species. The regenerating forest supported a substantial primate population and encounter rate (groups per km walked) in the regenerating sites was high compared to the neighboring old-growth forests. By monitoring elephant tracks for 10 yr, we demonstrated that elephant numbers increased steadily over time, but they increased dramatically since 2004. In general, the richness of the mammal community detected by sight, tracks, feces, and/or camera traps, was high in regenerating forests compared to that documented for the national park. We conclude that in Africa, a continent that has seen dramatic declines in the area of old-growth forest, there is ample opportunity to reclaim degraded areas and quickly restore substantial animal populations.

AB Naturally regenerating and restored second growth forests account for over 70% of tropical forest cover and provide key ecosystem services. Understanding climate change impacts on successional trajectories of these ecosystems is critical for developing effective large-scale forest landscape restoration (FLR) programs. Differences in environmental conditions, species composition, dynamics, and landscape context from old growth forests may exacerbate climate impacts on second growth stands. We compile data from 112 studies on the effects of natural climate variability, including warming, droughts, fires, and cyclonic storms, on demography and dynamics of second growth forest trees and identify variation in forest responses across biomes, regions, and landscapes. Across studies, drought decreases tree growth, survival, and recruitment, particularly during early succession, but the effects of temperature remain unexplored. Shifts in the frequency and severity of disturbance alter successional trajectories and increase the extent of second growth forests. Vulnerability to climate extremes is generally inversely related to long-term exposure, which varies with historical climate and biogeography. The majority of studies, however, have been conducted in the Neotropics hindering generalization. Effects of fire and cyclonic storms often lead to positive feedbacks, increasing vulnerability to climate extremes and subsequent disturbance. Fragmentation increases forests' vulnerability to fires, wind, and drought, while land use and other human activities influence the frequency and intensity of fire, potentially retarding succession. Comparative studies of climate effects on tropical forest succession across biogeographic regions are required to forecast the response of tropical forest landscapes to future climates and to implement effective FLR policies and programs in these landscapes.

AB When compared to planted reforestation, natural unassisted regeneration is often reported to result in slow recovery of biomass and biodiversity, especially early in succession. In some cases, naturally regenerating forests are not comparable to the community structure of primary forests after many decades. However, direct comparison of the outcomes of tropical forest restoration and natural regeneration is hindered by differences in metrics of forest recovery, inconsistency in land use histories, and dissimilarities in experimental design. We present the results of a replicated reforestation experiment comparing natural regeneration and polyculture tree planting at multiple diversity levels (3, 6, 9, or 12 native tree species), with uniform land use history and initial edaphic conditions. We compare the recovery of basal area and floristic diversity in these treatments after 5 yr of succession. Total basal area was higher in planted plots than in naturally regenerating plots, but it but did not vary among the different planted diversity levels. The basal area of woody recruits did not differ among treatments. The diversity of woody recruits increased substantially over time but did not vary among planting treatments. Species composition trajectories showed directional turnover over time, with no consistent differences among treatments. The convergence of restoration trajectories and similarity of floristic community diversity and composition across all treatments, after only 5 yr, provides evidence of the viability of natural regeneration for rapid restoration of forest biodiversity.

AB This paper presents a new synthesis of the role of native and non-native species in diverse pathways and processes that influence forest regeneration on anthropogenic grassland in the moist tropics. Because of altered species composition, abiotic conditions and landscape habitat mosaics, together with human interventions, these successional pathways differ from those seen in pre-clearing forests. However, representation of different functional life forms of plant (tree, vine, grass, herb and fern) and animal (frugivorous seed disperser, granivorous seed predator, seedling herbivore and carnivore) shows consistent global variation among areas of pasture, intact forest, and post-grassland regrowth. Biotic webs of interaction involve complex indirect influences and feedbacks, which can account for wide observed variation in regeneration trajectories over time. Important processes include: limitation of tree establishment by dense grasses; recruitment and growth of pioneer pasture trees (shading grasses and facilitating bird-assisted seed dispersal); and smothering of trees by vines. In these interactions, species' functional roles are more important than their biogeographic origins. Case studies in eastern Australia show native rain forest plant species diversity in all life forms increasing over time when pioneer trees are non-native (e.g., Cinnamomum camphora, Solanum mauritianum), concurrent with decreased grass and fern cover and increased abundance of trees and vine tangles. The global literature shows both native and non-native species facilitating and inhibiting regeneration. However conservation goals are often targeted at removing non-native species. Achieving large-scale tropical forest restoration will require increased recognition of their multiple roles, and compromises about allocating resources to their removal.

AB Assisted (or accelerated) natural regeneration (ANR) will play an important role in meeting the UN target to restore forest to 350 million hectares of degraded land, by 2030. However, since most accessible land is already used for agriculture, most of the sites, available for ANR, are far from roads and/or on difficult terrain, where implementing ANR with human labour is not practical. Therefore, this paper explores the potential of emerging technologies, such as low-cost UAVs (drones) and new imaging devices, to automate ANR tasks, including site monitoring (to assess site potential for natural regeneration, plan interventions and assess progress), maintenance of natural regeneration (particularly weeding) and species enrichment through aerial seeding. The usefulness of existing technologies is reviewed and future innovations needed, to provide practicable support for ANR, are discussed. Intensive collaboration, among technologists and forest ecologists, will be essential to ensure that technological innovations are based firmly on sound restoration science.

AB We present examples of large-scale farmer-managed natural regeneration of woody species in Africa to create new agroforestry systems. We also analyze two cases in Ethiopia of large-scale natural regeneration. The available evidence shows that the average costs per hectare of promoting on-farm natural regeneration are low as soon as farmers are familiar with this practice and begin to spontaneously adopt it. Based on these cases, current ambitious forest restoration targets can be achieved, but this goal requires a shift from tree planting to assisted natural regeneration. We propose a scaling-up strategy for natural regeneration based on experience gained mainly in the West African Sahel.

AB Natural regeneration offers a cheaper alternative to active reforestation and has the potential to become the predominant way of restoring degraded tropical landscapes at large-scale. We conducted a meta-analysis for tropical regions and quantified the relationships between both ecological and socioeconomic factors and biodiversity responses in naturally regenerating areas. Biogeographic realms, past disturbance, and the human development index (HDI) were used as explanatory variables for biodiversity responses. In addition, we present a case study of large-scale natural regeneration in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest and identify areas where different forms of restoration would be most suitable. Using our dataset for tropical regions, we showed that natural regeneration was predominantly reported within: the Neotropical realm; areas that were intensively disturbed; and countries with medium HDI. We also found that biodiversity in regenerating forests was more similar to the values found in old growth forests in: countries with either low, high, or very high HDI; less biodiverse realms; and areas of less intensive past disturbance. Our case study from Brazil showed that the level of forest gain resulting from environmental legislation, in particular the Brazilian Forest Code, has been reduced, but remains substantial. Complementary market incentives and financial mechanisms to promote large-scale natural regeneration in human-modified agricultural landscapes are also needed. Our analysis provides insights into the factors that promote or limit the recovery of biodiversity in naturally regenerating areas, and aids to identify areas with higher potential for natural regeneration.

AB Forest restoration requires strategies such as passive restoration to balance financial investments and ecological outcomes. However, the ecological outcomes of passive restoration are traditionally regarded as uncertain. We evaluated technical and legal strategies for balancing economic costs and ecological outcomes of passive versus active restoration in agricultural landscapes. We focused in the case of Brazil, where we assessed the factors driving the proportion of land allocated to passive and active restoration in 42 programs covering 698,398 hectares of farms in the Atlantic Forest, Atlantic Forest/cerrado ecotone and Amazon; the ecological outcomes of passive and active restoration in 2955 monitoring plots placed in six restoration programs; and the legal framework developed by some Brazilian states to balance the different restoration approaches and comply with legal commitments. Active restoration had the highest proportion of land allocated to it (78.4%), followed by passive (14.2%) and mixed restoration (7.4%). Passive restoration was higher in the Amazon, in silviculture, and when remaining forest cover was over 50 percent. Overall, both restoration approaches showed high levels of variation in the ecological outcomes; nevertheless, passively restored areas had a smaller percentage canopy cover, lower species density, and less shrubs and trees (dbh > 5 cm). The studied legal frameworks considered land abandonment for up to 4 years before deciding on a restoration approach, to favor the use of passive restoration. A better understanding of the biophysical and socioeconomic features of areas targeted for restoration is needed to take a better advantage of their natural regeneration potential.

AB The Forest and Landscape Restoration movement has emerged as an approach to reconcile biodiversity conservation, ecosystem services provisioning and human well-being in degraded landscapes, but little is known so far about the potential of different reforestation methods to achieve these objectives. Based on this gap, we assessed the ecological outcomes and local livelihood benefits of community-managed agroforests and second growth forests to assist natural regeneration in the coastal Atlantic Forest of Brazil. We investigated and compared agroforests and secondary forests according to their structure and floristic composition in 51 circular plots of 314 m(2), their role in supporting local livelihoods (45 semi-structured interviews) and the use and cultural importance of plant species (61 interviews). Agroforests and, more remarkably, managed secondary forests (1) re-established a well-developed forest structure, with a higher density of tree-sized individuals and similar basal area compared to nearby old growth forests; (2) were composed by a rich array of native species, including five threatened species, but had lower species richness than old growth remnants; and (3) improved local livelihoods by supplying market valuable and culturally important plants, including 231 native ethnospecies. Overall, local production systems showed remarkable potential to engage smallholders of developing tropical countries in Forest and Landscape Restoration and contribute to achieve its overall goals. We advocate the promotion of these systems as effective Forest and Landscape Restoration approaches in multi-scale programs and policies.

AB Shifting cultivation is a widespread practice in tropical forested areas that policy makers often regard as the major cause of forest degradation. Secondary fallow forests regrowing after shifting cultivation are generally not viewed as suitable for biodiversity conservation and carbon retention. Drawing upon our research in the Philippines and other relevant case studies, we compared the biodiversity and carbon sequestration in recovering secondary forests after shifting cultivation to other land uses that commonly follow shifting cultivation. Regenerating secondary forests had higher biodiversity than fast growing timber plantations and other restoration options available in the area. Some old plantations, however, provided carbon benefits comparable the old growth forest, although their biodiversity was less than that of the regenerating forests. Our study demonstrates that secondary forests regrowing after shifting cultivation have a high potential for biodiversity and carbon sequestration co-benefits, representing an effective strategy for forest management and restoration in countries where they are common and where the forest is an integral part of rural people's livelihoods. We discuss the issues and potential mechanisms through which such dynamic land use can be incorporated into development projects that are currently financing the sustainable management, conservation, and restoration of tropical forests.

AB Natural regeneration provides multiple benefits to nature and human societies, and can play a major role in global and national restoration targets. However, these benefits are context specific and impacted by both biophysical and socioeconomic heterogeneity across landscapes. Here, we investigate the benefits of natural regeneration for climate change mitigation, sediment retention and biodiversity conservation in a spatially explicit way at very high resolution for a region within the global biodiversity hotspot of the Atlantic Forest. We classified current land-use cover in the region and simulated a natural regeneration scenario in abandoned pasturelands, areas where potential conflicts with agricultural production would be minimized and where some early stage regeneration is already occurring. We then modeled changes in biophysical functions for climate change mitigation and sediment retention, and performed an economic valuation of both ecosystem services. We also modeled how land-use changes affect habitat availability for species. We found that natural regeneration can provide significant ecological and social benefits. Economic values of climate change mitigation and sediment retention alone could completely compensate for the opportunity costs of agricultural production over 20 yr. Habitat availability is improved for three species with different dispersal abilities, although by different magnitudes. Improving the understanding of how costs and benefits of natural regeneration are distributed can be useful to design incentive structures that bring farmers' decision making more in line with societal benefits. This alignment is crucial for natural regeneration to fulfill its potential as a large-scale solution for pressing local and global environmental challenges.

AB Reforestation involves potential trade-offs: hard choices between environmental and social benefits, individual and community benefits, and among stakeholders who bear different costs and benefits. In this manuscript, we aim to show that successful long-term reforestation requires stakeholder engagement beyond planning stages and a recognition of the dynamism of stakeholder outlooks as stakeholders' opportunities, relationships, interests, and roles change over time. We first summarize lessons from recent literature on stakeholder involvement within reforestation efforts. We then present findings from a multiple-stakeholder workshop organized in west-central Mexico, in which we illustrate their choices on how to navigate trade-offs among different reforestation intervention strategies (agroforestry/silvopastoral, natural regeneration, native species reforestation, commercial plantations). We confirm that individual stakeholders' circumstances, interests, and roles, as well as the contextual factors shaping them, are dynamic, continually changing the nature of the choices stakeholders face. Finally, we propose a four-phase pathway for addressing dynamic trade-offs and synergies in stakeholder participation in order to select, implement, and sustain successful reforestation activities. The pathway comprises four phases: (1) collaborate to devise a reforestation strategy through dialogue about dynamic trade-offs; (2) pledge robust stakeholder commitments to mutual arrangements for implementing reforestation; (3) implement reforestation interventions; and (4) adjust strategy through continuous evaluation of outcomes. We then elucidate how components of these four phases can be operationalized so that, on one side, scientists and practitioners might better understand the dynamic trade-offs reforestation poses for stakeholders, and on the other, stakeholders might balance their hard choices in ways that promote forest recovery.

AB Extensive tropical forest loss and degradation have stimulated increasing awareness at the international policy level of the need to undertake large-scale forest landscape restoration (FLR). Natural regeneration offers a cost-effective way to achieve large-scale FLR, but is often overlooked in favor of tree plantations. The studies presented in this special issue show how natural regeneration can become an important part of FLR and highlight the ecological, environmental, and social factors that must be considered to effectively do so. They also identify major knowledge gaps and outline a research agenda to support the use of natural regeneration in FLR. Six central questions emerge from these studies: (1) What are the ecological, economic, and livelihood outcomes of active and passive restoration interventions?; (2) What are the tradeoffs and synergies among ecological, economic, and livelihood outcomes of natural regeneration, restoration and productive land uses, and how do they evolve in the face of market and climate shocks?; (3) What diagnostic tools are needed to identify and map target areas for natural regeneration?; (4) How should spatial prioritization frameworks incorporate natural regeneration into FLR?; (5) What legal frameworks and governance structures are best suited to encourage natural regeneration and how do they change across regions and landscapes?; (6) What financial mechanisms can foster low-cost natural regeneration? Natural regeneration is not a panacea to solve tensions and conflicts over land use, but it can be advantageous under some circumstances. Identifying under what conditions this is the case is an important avenue for future research.

AB Dung beetles are extensively used as a focal taxon in tropical forests. Yet, information for most of their ecological functions comes from other systems. We present results from a field experiment in a tropical rain forest showing that dung beetle activity increases foliar phosphorus concentration in seedlings of the tree Brosimum lactescens. Our results open new lines of research to assess the multiple effects that dung beetles may have on rain forest plants.

AB Niche differentiation among tropical forest plants can generate species turnover along gradients of soil, topography, climate, and land use history. In this study we explore the relative importance of these variables as drivers of floristic composition in Cueva de Los Guacharos National Park. We established twenty 0.1-ha plots, within which trees, lianas, and shrubs (diameter >= 2.5 cm) were censused. We selected plot locations in primary and disturbed forests, and we measured topography and soil variables. Despite their structural similarity, primary and disturbed forests differed floristically, and also differed in environmental variables measured. A NMDS ordination showed that variation in the floristic composition across plots is highly correlated to the exchangeable acidity, elevation, temperature, and magnesium availability. Variance partitioning analysis shows that together spatial and environmental variables explain 24.2 percent of the variation in species composition. 'Pure environmental' variables were more important in explaining compositional variability than 'pure spatial' processes (9.8% and 1.4%, respectively). Residual variance may be attributed to stochastic process or non-measured biotic effects.

AB Phylogenetic information provides insight into the ecological and evolutionary processes that organize species assemblages. We compared patterns of phylogenetic diversity among macromycete and woody plant communities along a steep elevational gradient in eastern Mexico to better understand the evolutionary processes that structure their communities. Macrofungi and trees were counted and identified in eight sites from 100 to 3500 m asl, and sequence data retrieved from GenBank for the same or closely related species were used to reconstruct their phylogenies. Patterns of species richness and phylogenetic diversity were similar for both macrofungi and trees, but macromycete richness and diversity peaked at mid-elevations, whereas woody plant richness and diversity did not show significant trends with elevation. Phylogenetic similarity among sites was low for both groups and decreased as elevational distance between sites increased. Macromycete communities displayed phylogenetic overdispersion at low elevations and phylogenetic clustering at high elevations; the latter is consistent with environmental filtering at high elevation sites. Woody plants generally exhibited phylogenetic clustering, consistent with the potential importance of environmental filtering throughout the elevational gradient.

AB Caatinga vegetation continues to be converted into mosaics of secondary forest stands, but the affect of this process on biodiversity has not yet been examined. We used 35 regenerating and old-growth stands of Caatinga to examine the recovery of plant assemblages subsequent to slash-and-burn agriculture and cattle ranching/pasture in northeastern Brazil. Plant assemblages were contrasted in terms of community structure (stem density/basal area/species richness/diversity), functional (leaf habit/reproductive traits) and taxonomic composition. Soil attributes were also examined to infer potential drivers for cross-habitat differences. As expected, plant assemblages clearly differed across a large set of community-level attributes, including all trait categories relative to leaf habit and reproduction (pollination syndrome/floral color, size, type). Overall, old-growth forest stands supported distinct and more diverse assemblages at the plot and habitat level; e.g., long-lived tree species were almost exclusively found in old-growth forest stands. For most attributes, plant assemblages subsequent to pasture exhibited intermediate values between those exhibited by old-growth forest and those of agriculture-related stands. Surprisingly, soils exhibited similar fertility-related scores across habitats. Our results indicate that: (1) sprouting/resprouting represents an important mechanism of forest regeneration; (2) assemblage-level attributes suggest recovery at distinct rates; (3) forest regeneration implies community-level changes in both vegetative and reproductive functional attributes, including directional changes; (4) Caatinga is not able to completely recover in a period of 15-yr following land abandonment; and (5) historical land use affects recovery rates and successional pathways/taxonomic trajectories. Seasonally dry tropical forests may intrinsically cover a wide range of patterns relative to successional model, recovery rates and successional pathways.

AB The spear leaves of the palms Astrocaryum chambira and A. standleyanum have been traditionally used by Colombian indigenous communities as a source of fiber for handicraft production. Traditional management practices, including destructive harvest, have reduced population sizes of both species. We monitored a population of A. chambira in the Amazon, and one of A. standleyanum at the Pacific lowlands of Colombia. We then constructed integral projection models (IPM) to evaluate the transient population dynamics of populations under different exploitation regimes. Our results show that during the next 50 years the population of A. standleyanum will grow at an annual rate of 2.0 percent, and that of A. chambira at a rate of 0.8 percent. However, projected population growth is highly sensitive to harvest in both species: a destructive harvest of 5 percent of all usable individuals (subadults and adults) would cease population growth, while a 10 percent harvest intensity would cause populations to decrease by 0.5-0.6 percent annually. Our simulations further indicate that management practices associated with indigenous slash-and-burn agriculture would reduce fiber production, whereas caring for seedlings would increase population growth and fiber production in the coming decades. In order to sustain viable populations of both species and maintain a steady fiber supply, it is vital to prevent destructive harvest practices, and to leave some forest areas untouched, where populations can regenerate and act as a source of seedlings for intervened areas.

AB Empirical and theoretical work has suggested that plants can change their compensatory responses to herbivory as they develop. However, such a relationship is likely to be more complex than previously thought since the amount and type of damage a plant receives can also change as the plant develops. Here, we determined the survival, growth, and reproductive output of plants (Actinocephalus polyanthus) from different ontogenetic stages that received variable levels of natural or simulated herbivore damage. Juvenile plants and nonreproductive adults in which leaves were damaged showed full vegetative compensation, whereas pre-reproductive plants were not able to replace the lost leaves. However, these same pre-reproductive plants produced more inflorescences and thus more seeds and seedlings than control plants. In contrast, damage to vegetative and/or reproductive structures during the reproductive phase resulted in a negative effect on seed and seedling production. Herbivory effects on plant survival, growth, and reproduction during the vegetative and pre-reproductive phases were independent of the amount of damage. However, during reproduction, the magnitude of these effects was strongly influenced by the amount of damage and the reproductive stage of the plant at the time of the damage. In short, our results demonstrate that the survival, growth, and reproductive responses to herbivory of A. polyanthus can be dependent on the timing and/or intensity of damage. The reproductive response of A. polyanthus to our simulated herbivory treatments during the pre-reproductive phase represents an example of overcompensation. Furthermore, it indicates that vegetative regrowth is not necessarily a driving factor for tolerance.

AB Gene dispersal and clonality are important aspects of plant evolution affecting the spatial genetic structure (SGS) and the long-term survival of species. In the tropics these parameters have mostly been investigated in trees and some herbs, but rarely in climbers which frequently: (1) show clonal growth leading to a patchy distribution pattern similar to that of understory herbs; and (2) flower in the canopy where they may have access to long-distance dispersal like canopy trees. We thus hypothesize for climbers an intermediate genetic structure between herbs and trees. The study aims at assessing breeding system and spatial extent of clonality and gene dispersal in Haumania danckelmaniana (Marantaceae), a common climber in the tropical rain forests from western Central Africa. In eastern Cameroon, 330 ramets were sampled at three spatial scales and genotyped at seven microsatellite loci. Clonality was moderate (clonal extend: 15-25 m, clonal diversity 0.4-0.65) indicating the importance of recruitment from seeds at this locality. The low inbreeding (FIS) suggested predominant outcrossing. The rate of decay of the relatedness between individuals with distance indicated limited gene dispersal distance (rg = 9-50 m, neighborhood sizes Nb = 23-67) in accordance with narrowly gravity dispersed seeds and restricted pollen transfer distance in densely flowering populations. The marked SGS (Sp = 0.011-0.026) was similar to that reported in tropical trees, but might increase with augmented clonality as in many herbs, especially under more severe disturbance regimes.

AB To cope with the limiting light conditions in the rain forest understory, many tropical tree species have evolved large seeds that provide the emerging seedlings with nutritional reserves. Habitat fragmentation might change the adaptive value of seed size by modifying the biotic and physical conditions of the forest understory. We experimentally assessed the potential of fragmentation to alter how seed mass affects seedling survival, vigor, and attack by natural enemies of the tropical tree Nectandra ambigens. Seeds from different mother trees (families) were individually weighed and sown in experimental sites established in continuous forest and in forest fragments. Seedling survival, vigor, and damage by herbivores and pathogens were recorded periodically. While seedlings derived from larger seeds had higher survival rates in both habitats, seedling survival and vigor were significantly greater in forest fragments, and the seedlings also suffered fewer attacks by natural enemies. We found genetic variance for seed mass among families with a heritability value (h(2)) of 0.66, and we found evidence for selection on seed size. Average seed size differed between dead and living seedlings in three sites. In one fragment, seed size was selectively neutral in relation to survival. Overall, selection for seed size promoted survival and thus appears to affect the distribution of this trait. The maintenance of genetic variance could be related to the stochastic nature of the formation of light gaps. Our results highlight the importance of evaluating the adaptive value of traits susceptible to environmental changes for conservation purposes.

AB In the past century, our understanding of the processes driving plant invasion and its consequences for natural and anthropogenic systems has increased considerably. However, the management of invasive plants remains a challenge despite ever more resources being allocated to their removal. Often invasive plants targeted for 'eradication' are well-established, have multiple modes of reproduction, long-term seed banks, and strong associations with native and non-native mutualists that ensure dispersal and facilitate spread. The pantropical weed, Lantana camara (Lantana), is one of the most invasive woody plants globally. We illustrate that, for Lantana, eradication is an unrealistic management goal given the short-term removal approaches, irrespective of the effectiveness of removal methods. We assessed the role of dispersal by avian frugivores in the recolonization of managed areas by Lantana in the seasonally dry, tropical forests of northern and southern India. We estimated the distribution of Lantana, its dispersal potential and the proximity between managed areas and source populations. We found that Lantana was dispersed by many generalist frugivorous birds and that most managed areas were well within the median dispersal distance from source plants facilitating rapid recolonization of managed areas. We conclude that given the difficulty of eradicating long-established invasive plants, management practices should entail long-term monitoring and control in priority areas for as long as Lantana occurs in the landscape.

AB Although famous for photic courtship displays, fireflies (Coleoptera: Lampyridae) are also notable for emitting strong odors when molested. The identity of volatile emissions and their possible role, along with photic signals, as aposematic warnings of unpalatability have been little explored, especially in tropical species. Pursuant to the observation that the widespread Neotropical fireflies, Photuris trivittata and Bicellonycha amoena, emit pungent odors, glows, and flashes when handled, we investigated their cuticular and headspace chemistry. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses revealed that both fireflies have species-specific cuticular hydrocarbon profiles. Photuris trivittata headspace was dominated by 2-methoxy-3-(1-methylpropyl) pyrazine (hereafter, pyrazine), on the order of 1.59 ng/individual and a suite of sesquiterpenes, while B. amoena emitted 3-methoxy-2-butenoic acid methyl ester and a few ketones. This is the first report of such compounds in fireflies. We investigated the role of pyrazine in P. trivittata's interactions with potential predators: sympatric ants, toads, and bats. Solvent-washed P. trivittata painted with pyrazine incurred lower ant predation than did their solvent-washed counterparts. Pyrazine significantly repelled ants at baits in concentrations as low as 9.8 x 10(-4) ng/mu l. The toad, Rhinella marina, readily accepted intact fireflies, pyrazine-coated and uncoated mealworms. Both Myotis nigricans and Molossus molossus bats rejected fireflies, but accepted both pyrazine-coated and uncoated mealworms. While pyrazine repels ants, its role as an aposematic signal warning other potential predators of firefly distastefulness requires further investigation. Our results underscore the idea that multiple enemies exert conflicting selection on firefly defenses.

AB Termites have a large influence on ecosystem functioning. Understanding what drives termite activity patterns improves understanding of nutrient cycling, productivity, and heterogeneity in savannas. We present a mechanistic framework that relates the interactive effects of rainfall, grassland structure, large herbivore presence, and soil factors to termite activity. To test this framework, we used grass litterbags to monitor termite activity at ten sites across Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park, South Africa. We assessed the effects of abiotic and biotic factors on termite activity at two scales: the large (landscape) scale, variation in bait removal among 300 m(2) plots that were distributed across the park and at the small (within-plot) scale (1-300 m(2)). Half of our sites were located inside large herbivore exclosures to test for the effect of mammalian herbivore presence. At the landscape scale, termite grass removal declined towards higher rainfall and in the presence of mammalian herbivores. Removal did not depend on soil factors. At the small scale, removal declined with increasing grass height, particularly in the 1 m surrounding the bait bag. Resource quality did not affect bait removal. We suggest that competition for forage drives the negative effect of mammalian herbivores on termites, whereas lower bait removal in taller swards may be due to direct negative effects from rainfall, fire and/or competition with free-living microbes. Ultimately, we suggest that the impact of termites on nutrient cycling is most pronounced when abiotic (rainfall) and biotic conditions (mammalian herbivory) limit grass removal by fire and decomposition by free-living microbes.

AB The recent trend of agricultural intensification in tropical landscapes poses a new threat to biodiversity conservation. Conversion of previously heterogeneous agricultural landscapes to intensive plantation agriculture simplifies and homogenizes the landscape, reducing availability, and connectivity of natural habitat for native species. To assess the impact of agricultural intensification on bats, we characterized the bat assemblage in the Sarapiqui region of Costa Rica, where heterogeneous land uses are being converted to intensive, large-scale pineapple plantations. In 2012 and 2013, we sampled bats in 20 remnant forest patches surrounded by varying proportions of pasture, mature forest, and pineapple and captured 1821 individual bats representing 39 species. We used ordination analyses to evaluate changes in species composition, where pineapple is the main component of the agricultural matrix. We identified landscape metrics specifically correlated with pineapple and used multiple linear regression to test their effects on bat species richness, diversity, and guild-specific relative abundance. Results suggest pineapple expansion is driving changes in assemblage composition in remnant forest patches, resulting in new assemblages with higher proportions of frugivorous bats and lower proportions of insectivorous bats than in continuous mature forests. In addition, while pineapple does not diminish total bat species richness and diversity, the reduced forest cover and increased distance between forest patches in pineapple plantations has a significant negative impact on the relative abundance of insectivores. We also identify a potential threshold effect whereby patches surrounded by more than 50 percent forest can retain assemblage composition similar to that found in continuous mature forest.

AB Fruit selection, i.e., the consumption of fruits disproportionately to their availability, results from the interaction between diet preferences and ecological factors that modify them. We assessed the importance of functional fruit traits to explain fruit selection by birds in Andean subtropical forests, taking into account temporal variation in trait distribution in the assembly of available fruits. During 2 yr, we measured the abundance of ripe fruits and their consumption by birds in a 6-ha plot during 11 bimonthly samplings, and we used 17 phenological, morphological, and nutritional traits to characterize fruits selected by four bird species. Fruit selection was pervasive year-round, highly variable over time and across bird species. Fruit species were selected over time periods shorter than their ripening phenology, and the selection of fruits with particular traits was specific to the fruit-eating species. Maximization in pulp reward per consumed fruit seems to be the main driving force behind fruit selection, indicating that birds select fruits with traits that directly affect net energy gain. Our results can be interpreted in a framework of a hierarchy of foraging decisions, under which the spatiotemporal context of the fruiting environment modifies the relative intake rates of a particular fruit, while the ability to discriminate fruit contents becomes increasingly important on a smaller dimension. We show that fruit-selection properties are contingent on specific fruit traits and particular spatiotemporal conditions, which modify the structure of mutualistic interactions.

AB The long-standing paradigm that pollination systems adapted to hovering birds evolved only in the New World was recently challenged by the discovery of hovering pollination by Old World specialized passerine pollinators. This raises the possibility that hovering pollination may evolve more easily than previously believed, given sufficient selective pressure on plant traits, on nectarivory, or both. We observed foraging behavior by the sunbird Cyanomitra oritis at flowers of the native Old World plant Impatiens sakeriana. We measured the length of pedicels and peduncles (PedPed length), which can make the flowers difficult to reach while the bird perches on the stem, and determined if it influenced sunbird hovering or perching at a flower. Detailed analyses of video recordings showed that sunbirds only hovered at flowers with a long PedPed, whereas they employed both foraging modes when an adequate perch was available. A hovering sunbird could deplete nectar in a shorter time than a perching one. The frequency of visits was not greater at flowers with longer PedPed or with more open I. sakeriana flowers in the vicinity. Our study provides evidence that sunbird behavior does not follow simple energetic models, and that some sunbird pollination systems in the Old World resemble highly specialized hummingbird systems in the New World much more than expected, especially the overall adaptation of the system to bird hovering.

AB To test the hypothesis that subtle differences in abiotic requirements can result in almost total spatial segregation, we sampled two species of diurnal frogs, Atelopus spumarius and Allobates sumtuosus, in a primary forest reserve in central Brazilian Amazonia. We conducted visual and acoustic surveys on three occasions over 2 months, in 40 streamside (riparian) plots distributed throughout the reserve's two major drainage basins, using a grid system that covers 64 km(2). On average, drainages differed in the pH of stream water and the number of connected and isolated streamside pools. Differences in abiotic characteristics of drainages were associated with the spatial distribution of frog species. The occurrence and density of Allobates sumtuosus was negatively related to stream pH and discharge and positively related to the number of isolated pools in plots. The occurrence and density of Atelopus spumarius was associated with streams with high discharge and pH near neutral. These results indicate that although very large reserves will probably contain sufficient landscape heterogeneity to accommodate different species of diurnal frogs, due to strongly patchy distributions, in situ studies using fine-scale species-distribution models will be necessary to assess the adequacy of small reserves in Amazonia that cover hundreds of square kilometers or less for the conservation of some anuran species.

AB The relationships between floristic patterns and environmental variation in tropical savannas have been the focus of many studies worldwide. However, important aspects of these relationships, such as the role of geographic distance in structuring plant communities, have received little attention. We investigated the individual and combined influences of substrate, climatic, and spatial factors on the floristic-structural dissimilarity between two savanna physiognomies in the core region of Brazilian savannas: one on plain relief with deep soils and another on steep relief with shallow rocky soils. Ten 1-ha plots were sampled in each physiognomy. We modeled species abundance using multiple linear models and variance partitioning. Our results indicated that spatial processes that are intrinsically related to species variation have negligible effects on floristic variation. The most important predictors in our models were related to soil characteristics (mainly nutrient availability) and topography (relief and elevation). Consequently, the substrate component exhibited the greatest power (14%) in explaining the floristic-structural variation in the overall variance partitioning. Our results provide the first demonstration of the individual and combined contributions of substrate, climatic, and spatial factors to the occurrence and abundance of woody species in the most diverse and threatened savanna in the world. We also provide evidence that neutral processes might not be strong predictors of vegetation structure where savanna substrates differ greatly; instead, community structure may be primarily regulated by environmental filters.

AB Previously extensive tracts of primary rain forest have been degraded by human activities, and we examined how the effects of forest disturbance arising from habitat fragmentation and commercial selective logging affected ecosystem functioning in these habitats by studying leaf litter decomposition rates in litter bags placed on the forest floor. The rain forests of Borneo are dominated by trees from the family Dipterocarpaceae, and we compared leaf litter decomposition rates of three dipterocarp species at eight forest fragment sites (area 3-3529 ha) that had different histories of disturbance pre-fragmentation: four fragments had been selectively logged prior to fragmentation and four had been formed from previously undisturbed forest. We compared these logged and unlogged forest fragments with sites in continuous forest that had been selectively logged (two sites) and fully protected and undisturbed (two sites). After 120 d, undisturbed continuous forest sites had the fastest rates of decomposition (52% mass loss). Forest fragments formed from unlogged forest (32% mass loss) had faster decomposition rates than logged forest fragments (28% mass loss), but slower rates than continuous logged forest (39% mass loss). Leaves of a light-demanding species (Parashorea malaanonan) decomposed faster than those of a shade-tolerant species (Hopea nervosa), but decomposition of all three dipterocarp species that we studied responded similarly to logging and fragmentation effects. Reduced decomposition rates in logged and fragmented forest sites may affect nutrient cycling and thus have detrimental consequences for forest regeneration. Conservation management to improve forest quality should be a priority, particularly in logged forest fragments.

AB Wet tropical forest trees display a wide range of leaf phenology dynamics. However, the interrelation between deciduousness, water status, and leaf and stem characteristics have been poorly investigated compared with dry forests. We studied wet forest trees to answer the following questions: (1) do water regulation modes (iso/anisohydric behavior) of evergreen species differ from those found in deciduous species? (2) Does leaf water potential (Psi(L)) influences leaffall and emergence dynamics? (3) Are leaf and stem characteristics consistent across evergreen and deciduous trees? We evaluated vegetative phenology, Psi(L), and leaf and stem characteristics of six evergreen and three deciduous species monthly for 2 yr. Species exhibited different leaffall and emergence dynamics, as well as different water regulation modes, independent of their deciduousness. Thus, the relationship between leaf phenology and water regulation behaviors appears to be a species-specific property rather than a functional group attribute. Psi(L) had no direct influence on the dynamics of leaffall and/or emergence, indicating that this process is not modulated by water availability alone. Individual groups of evergreen and deciduous species could not be identified using principal component analysis (PCA), but a decoupling was observed in the leaf and stem economics spectra. The lack of an interrelation between deciduousness and iso/anisohydry, as well as the independence of leaf and stem trade-offs, emphasizes that more systematic measurements of vegetative phenology and ecophysiological characteristics are necessary to advance our knowledge of leaf habit and water regulation behaviors based on the functional traits of wet forest plants.

AB Few studies have successfully monitored community-wide phenological patterns in seasonally flooded Amazonian varzea forests, where a prolonged annual flood pulse arguably generates the greatest degree of seasonality of any low-latitude ecosystem on Earth. We monitored the vegetative and reproductive plant phenology of varzea (VZ) floodplain and adjacent terra firme (TF) forests within two contiguous protected areas in western Brazilian Amazonia, using three complementary methods: monthly canopy observations of 1056 individuals (TF: 556, VZ: 500), twice monthly collections from 0.5-m(2) litterfall traps within two 100-ha plots (1 TF, 1 VZ; 96 traps per plot), and monthly ground surveys of residual fruit-fall along transect-grids within each 100-ha plot (12 km per plot). Surveys encompassed the entire annual flood cycle and employed a floating trap design to cope with fluctuating water levels. Phenology patterns were generally similar in both forest types. Leaffall peaked during the aquatic phase in varzea forest and the dry season in terra firme. Flowering typically followed leaffall and leaf flush, extending into the onset of the terrestrial phase and rainy season in varzea and terra firme, respectively. Abiotic seed dispersal modes were relatively more prevalent in varzea than terra firme; the main contrast in fruiting seasonality was more likely a result of differences in community composition and relative abundance of seed dispersal modes than differences within individual genera. We emphasize the difficulty in distinguishing the role of the flood pulse from other seasonal environmental variables without multiannual data or spatially replicated studies across the spectrum of Amazonian forest types.

AB Savannas are spatially diverse, variable and are susceptible to high rates of disturbance from fire and herbivory. There is significant interest in woody cover dynamics in relation to disturbance regimes. Less effort has been devoted to understand processes that drive tree community composition. In this study, tree species composition data collected at the landscape scale in the Serengeti were used to identify key environmental factors driving variation in species composition. A system of 38 plots clustered within 10 sites spanning the mean annual precipitation (MAP) gradient was used to assess the relative role of bottom-up (precipitation, soil nutrients and soil texture) vs. top-down factors (fire and elephant herbivory) on tree community composition. We developed candidate models relating tree species composition (based on multivariate community analysis) to different combinations of plot-level environmental covariates. Results suggest that tree community composition is largely driven by MAP and is associated with elephant population density. Strikingly, we found no evidence that fire influences species compositional turnover. In a second analysis, we used structural equation model (SEM) to explore the possible direction of association between elephant density and tree species composition. We compared a model that included elephant effects on composition to one that included community composition effects on elephant density. Results suggest that variation in elephant population density across space is more likely to drive tree community composition and not vice versa. We propose that precipitation and herbivory, rather than fire, determine tree species composition in Serengeti Acacia tree community.

AB A growing body of literature has demonstrated significant biodiversity losses for many taxa when forest is converted to oil palm. However, no studies have directly investigated changes to biodiversity throughout the oil palm life cycle, in which oil palm matures for 25-30 yr before replanting. This process leads to major changes in the oil palm landscape that likely influence species assemblages and ecosystem function. We compare frog assemblages between mature (21-27-yr old) and recently replanted (1-2-yr old) oil palm in Sumatra, Indonesia. Across eighteen 2.25-ha oil palm plots, we found 719 frogs from 14 species. Frog richness was 31 percent lower in replanted oil palm (nine species) than mature oil palm (13 species). Total frog abundance was 47 percent lower in replanted oil palm, and frog assemblage composition differed significantly between the two ages of oil palm. The majority of frog species were disturbance-tolerant, although we encountered four forest-associated frog species within mature oil palm despite a distance of 28 km between our study sites and the nearest extensive tract of forest. Although it is clear that protection of forest is of paramount importance for the conservation of tropical fauna, our results indicate that management decisions within tropical agricultural landscapes also have a profound impact on biodiversity. Practices such as staggered replanting or maintenance of connectivity among mature oil palm patches could help maintain frog diversity in the oil palm landscape.

AB Documented patterns of specialization and species interactions often omit plasticity in resource use across space and time, yet such variation is an important part of species interactions. To examine temporal variation in resource use, we compared species- and community-level patterns of host plant use by folivorous caterpillars between the dry and rainy seasons in four preserved areas of cerrado vegetation in the Distrito Federal, Brazil. We sampled plants and caterpillars in 10 m circular plots monthly from March 2010 to March 2011. At the community level, we found a significant increase in the mean diet breadth of dry season caterpillars relative to those collected in the rainy season. Families and species of moths varied in diet breadth, but most exhibited a seasonal expansion. In particular, intraspecific comparisons showed a 30% increase in the number of host plants used in the dry season compared to the rainy season. These results provide a clear example of how temporal variation in resource use is heterogeneous, and more generalized patterns of resource use can emerge from studies at large temporal scales. Thus, seasonal or annual heterogeneity may obscure ecologically relevant specialized interactions that occur at smaller scales.

AB The historical and contemporary loss of large-bodied frugivores has disrupted many plant-disperser mutualisms, with potentially profound consequences for plants. Although several aspects of seed dispersal by megafrugivores have already been examined, the role of these species in promoting seed-mediated gene flow has remained unexplored. We evaluated the role of the Amazonian tapir (Tapirus terrestris), the largest Neotropical frugivore, in shaping plant genetic structure through seed-mediated gene flow. We used microsatellites to analyze the genetic patterns of Syagrus romanzoffiana seedlings recruited in tapir latrines and around conspecific adult palms, the two sites where seeds and seedlings are most frequently found in this species. While the genetic diversity of seedlings was rather similar in both sites, the kinship structure was substantially weaker in latrines. Most seedlings recruited around adult palms were half-or full-sibs originating from those adults. In contrast, seedlings recruited in latrines came from several (>5, on average) contributing mothers other than the nearest adult (95%) and were mostly non-sibs (72%). Kinship patterns indicated that tapir-mediated dispersal promotes the admixture of genotypes across space. Also, our results suggested that genetic diversity and the number of contributing mothers in latrines increase with the number of fruiting adults visited by tapirs before defecating and with the accumulation of feces over time. We provide evidence of the relevance of tapirs in mobilizing maternal progenies (and genotypes) across the landscape and recruiting clusters of unrelated seedlings. This study suggests a key role for plant-megafrugivore interactions in seed-mediated gene flow and emphasizes the importance of preserving such mutualisms.

AB The mobility and dispersal of organisms affect population genetics and dynamics, and consequently affect persistence and the risk of extinction. Thus, it is important to understand how organisms move in the fragmented landscapes in order to manage populations and predict the effects of habitat changes on species persistence. This study evaluated the functional connectivity of an orchid bee (Eulaema atleticana Nemesio, 2009) with a high fidelity to forest habitats in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest Corridor by analyzing genetic diversity, spatial genetic structure, and gene flow estimated from microsatellite and mitochondrial markers. Genetic diversity was not correlated with area of the forest fragments, or with forest isolation. At the mosaic scale, Eulaema atleticana showed no significant or low genetic differentiation, indicating genetic homogeneity among forest fragments. A previous field study indicated that Eulaema atleticana was one of the most sensitive Euglossina bees to forest fragmentation but the present molecular analyses demonstrates that current gene flow is sufficient to maintain genetic variability at the mosaic scale.

In Bornean dipterocarp forests, certain diurnal, arboreal, territorial, and ecologically dominant 'COCY' ant species (Colobopsis cylindrica clade) grazed epiphytic biofilms on adaxial leaf surfaces, as well as on tree trunks and branches. Microscopic examination of worker buccal pellets revealed numerous (mainly ascomycete) fungal spores, together with insect appendages and cuticle. Direct observations, video-imaging, and delta N-15 isotope data rule out feeding by predation, but isotopes cannot separate fungi from plant and insect exudates as principal nitrogen sources. Lipid-rich products, extracted from pellets in situ, are hypothesized sources of essential sterols. Also present in pellets were colorful mandibular gland (MG) compounds unique to this ant clade and deployed, as a derived character state, in suicidal defense of foraging territories. Mildly antimicrobial and highly adhesive MG products also occur basally in the clade and may have first evolved for roles in microbial sterilization and food-gathering and processing. Proteomic studies of YG COCY ants detected 2% proteins in hypertrophied, product-filled MG reservoirs, but SDS-PAGE qualitative analysis revealed mostly low-molecular mass proteins and peptides (8-15 kDa), too small for enzymes but consistent with membrane-binding proteins and/or antimicrobial peptides. Breakdown of chitin and chitosan in pellets may occur with enzymes derived from molting fluids in insect cuticle (proteases and chitinases) and/or fungi and bacteria. To the extent that COCY workers collect and consume pathogenic and/or beneficial phyllosphere microbes, ant effects on plants may be mediated by these activities.

AB Biodiversity in pristine forest biomes is increasingly disturbed by human activity. Drivers such as logging and climate extremes are thought to collectively erode diversity, but their interactions are not well understood. However, ignoring such complexities may result in poor conservation management decisions. Here, we present the first study dealing with the complexity arising from the effects of interactions of two increasingly important disturbance factors (selective logging and climatic extreme events) on beta diversity patterns at different scales. Specifically, we examined extensive amphibian assemblage datasets obtained within a quasi-experimental pre-/post-harvesting scheme in the lowland rainforests of Central Guyana. Changes in small-scale patterns of beta diversity were not detectable at the higher landscape level, indicating that local-scale dynamics are more informative for evaluating disturbance impacts. The results also underscore the importance of including abundance data when investigating homogenization or heterogenization effects, which should be considered when designing post-logging impact assessments and selecting impact indicators. Moreover, logging should be regarded as a multifaceted driver that contributes to changes in biodiversity patterns in different ways, depending on interactions with other drivers. The effects of extreme climate events were significantly more pronounced in unlogged forest, while logged forest assemblages appeared buffered due to the presence of novel habitats. Imprudent post-logging renaturation measures may thus counteract conservation targets. These findings highlight the fact that indicator bias and unaccounted interactions between multiple drivers can lead to misguided management strategies.

ID SPECIES RICHNESS; BIODIVERSITY
AB Efforts to protect the remaining Araucaria Forest fragments in Southern Brazil have focused on large forests dominated by the threatened species Araucaria angustifolia. However, such an approach can miss significant biodiversity by ignoring smaller forest fragments scattered throughout the landscape, many of which exist on small farms. Here, I evaluate the method used to define a set of natural reserves in Southern Brazil to assess if it captures and preserves the significant biodiversity that exists in this unique biome. I used a relatively simple field sampling methodology and statistical analyses to evaluate floristic and structural parameters, comparing tree species diversity within a large forest fragment (with and without A. angustifolia dominance) to smaller fragments in the surrounding landscape. While stands dominated by A. angustifolia showed primary forest-like physiognomy, they did not have the levels of diversity expected for old-growth forests. Traditional forestry parameters, especially basal area and number of individuals, are useful for differentiating forest types in terms of structure. While no single diversity index provides a complete picture of the composition and variation of diversity in forest fragments, when taken together and assessed using extrapolation and comparative statistics, they provide a meaningful method for comparing and identifying high priority areas for conservation. Future conservation strategies should look to alternative approaches for assessing biodiversity across the landscape, while including small-scale landowners in conservation efforts.

AB Adaptations for foraging in the complex airspaces of forest interiors may make bat species in the Asian tropics particularly susceptible to forest loss. However, ecomorphological analysis of Vietnamese bat assemblages challenges the hypothesis that, due to their greater vagility, cave-roosting bats are less vulnerable to habitat fragmentation than foliage-roosting species. Of the 13 most highly adapted forest-interior species in our study, eight were cave-roosting members of the Rhinolophidae and Hipposideridae and had wing morphologies closely resembling five foliage-roosting members of the Murininae and Kerivoulinae-species typically thought to have low vagility. Overall, both cave-roosting and foliage-roosting bats exhibited a wide range of flight indices and species' wing designs corresponded with preferred foraging habitats, suggesting that foraging strategy may outweigh roost preference as a determinant of bat wing morphology and flight performance. Consequently, where such variation occurs, cave-roosting bat ensembles are likely to include species with low vagility and similar sensitivity to habitat fragmentation. This could have important conservation implications as Asian karst formations support high cave densities and important bat diversity yet increasingly represent forest refugia in anthropogenic landscapes. We, therefore, advocate greater consideration of species vagility in determining conservation priorities for the region's bat fauna.

AB By harvesting scattered large trees, selective logging increases light availability and thereby stimulates growth and crown expansion at early-life stage among remnant trees. We assessed the effects of logging on total and merchantable bole (i.e., lowest branch at crown base) heights on 952 tropical canopy trees in French Guiana. We observed reductions in both total (mean, -2.3 m) and bole (mean, -2.0 m) heights more than a decade after selective logging. Depending on local logging intensity, height reductions resulted in 2-13 percent decreases in aboveground tree biomass and 3-17 percent decreases in bole volume. These results highlight the adverse effects of logging at both tree and stand levels. This decrease in height is a further threat to future provision of key environmental services, such as timber production and carbon sequestration.

AB Understanding the mechanisms controlling secondary succession in tropical dry forests is important for the conservation and restoration of this highly threatened biome. Canopy-forming trees in tropical forests strongly influence later stages of succession through their effect on woody plant regeneration. In dry forests, this may be complex given the seasonal interplay of water and light limitations. We reviewed observational and experimental studies to assess (1) the relative importance of positive and negative effects of established trees on regeneration; (2) the mechanisms underlying these effects; and (3) to test the 'stress gradient hypothesis' in successional tropical dry forests. The effects of established trees on seed dispersal, seed survival, and seed germination-either through direct changes to moisture and temperature regimes or mediated by seed dispersers and predators-are mainly positive. The balance between positive and negative effects on seedling establishment is more complex and depends on the season and leaf phenology of both trees and seedlings. Seedling survival is generally enhanced by established trees mitigating dry conditions. Established trees have counteracting effects on water and light availability that influence seedling growth. The probability of a positive effect of established trees on seedling survival decreases with increased rainfall, which supports the stress gradient hypothesis. Priorities for future research are experiments to test for facilitation and competition and their underlying mechanisms, long-term studies evaluating how these effects change with ontogeny, and studies focusing on the species-specificity of interactions.

AB The high biodiversity of tropical forest streams depends on the strong input of organic matter, yet the leaf litter decomposition dynamics in these streams are not well understood. We assessed how seasonal litterfall affects leaf litter breakdown, density and biomass of aquatic invertebrates, and the microbial biomass and sporulation of aquatic hyphomycetes in a South American grassland 'vereda' landscape. Although litter production in the riparian area was low, leaf litter breakdown was high compared with other South American systems, with maximum values coinciding with the rainy season. Fungal biomass in decomposing leaves was high, but spore densities in water and sporulation rates were very low. Invertebrates were not abundant in litter bags, suggesting they play a minor role in leaf litter decomposition. Chironomids accounted for similar to 70 percent of all invertebrates; only 10 percent of non-Chironomidae invertebrates were shredders. Therefore, fungi appear to be the drivers of leaf litter decomposition. Our results show that despite low productivity and relatively fast litter decomposition, organic matter accumulated in the stream and riparian area. This pattern was attributed to the wet/dry cycles in which leaves falling in the flat riparian zone remain undecomposed (during the dry period) and are massively transported to the riverbed (rainy season).

AB African herbaceous biomes will likely face drastic changes in the near future, due to climate change and pressures from increasing human activities. However, these biomes have been simulated only by dynamic global vegetation models and failing to include the diversity of C-4 grasses has limited the accuracy of these models. Characterizing the floristic and physiognomic diversity of these herbaceous biomes would enhance the parameterization of C-4 grass plant functional types, thereby improving simulations. To this end, we used lowermost and uppermost values of three grass physiognomic traits (culm height, leaf length, and leaf width) available in most floras to identify several grass physiognomic groups that form the grass cover in Senegal. We then checked the capacity of these groups to discriminate herbaceous biomes and mean annual precipitation domains. Specifically, we assessed whether these groups were sufficiently generic and robust to be applied to neighboring (Chad) and distant (South Africa) phytogeographic areas. The proportions of two physiognomic groups, defined by their lowermost limits, delineate steppe from savanna and forest biomes in Senegal, and nama-karoo, savanna, and grassland biomes in South Africa. Proportions of these two physiognomic groups additionally delineate the mean annual precipitation domains <600 mm and >600 mm in Senegal, Chad, and South Africa, as well as the <250 mm and >1000 mm domains in South Africa. These findings should help to identify and parameterize new C-4 grass plant functional types in vegetation models applied to West and South Africa.

AB Mutualistic relationships between organisms have long captivated biologists, and extrafloral nectaries, or nectar-producing glands, found on many plants are a good example. The nectar produced from these glands provides food for ants, which may defend the plant from potential herbivores in turn. However, relatively little is known about their impact on the long-term growth and survival of plants that produce them. To better understand the ecological significance of extrafloral nectaries, we examined their incidence on lowland tropical rain forest trees in Yasuni National Park in Amazonian Ecuador, and collated data from two other tropical lowland forest sites (Barro Colorado Island, Panama and Pasoh Forest Reserve, Malaysia). At Yasuni, extrafloral nectaries were found on 137 of 1123 species censused (12.2%), widely distributed among different angiosperm families. This rate of incidence is high but consistent with other tropical locations. Furthermore, this study adds 18 new genera and two new families (Urticaceae and Caricaceae) to the list of taxa exhibiting extrafloral nectaries. Using demographic data from long-term forest dynamics plots at each site, we compared the growth and mortality rates of species with extrafloral nectaries to those without. After controlling for phylogeny, no general relationship between extrafloral nectary presence and demographic rates could be detected, suggesting little demographic signal from any community-wide ecological effects.
   Resumen La relaciones mutualistas entre especies siempre han cautivado el interes de los Biologos, y los nectarios extraflorales (EFNs) o el nectar producido por glandulas es un buen ejemplo de esto. El nectar producido por estas glandulas puede ser consumido por hormigas, las cuales en retorno defienden la planta de posible herbivoros. Sin embargo, pocos estudios han evaluado el impacto a largo plazo en crecimiento y supervivencia de especies que poseen estas estructuras. Para un mejor entendimiento sobre el significado ecologico de estos nectarios extraflorales, hemos examinado la incidencia en arboles de bosques humedos tropicales en tierras bajas en el Parque Nacional Yasuni, Amazonia Ecuatoriana, y comparado con bosques tropicales en La Isla de Barro Colorado, Panama y La Reserva Forestal Pasoh, Malasya. Se registraron nectarios extraflorales 137 de las 1123 especies en Yasuni (12.2%), los cuales se presentaron en diferentes familias a lo largo de las angiospermas. Esta alta incidencia fue encontrada igualmente en otras localidades. Adicionalmente, en este estudio se reporta la presencia de nectarios extraflorales en 18generos y dos 2 familias (Urticaceae and Caricaceae) no citados en estudios previos. Informacion demografica de las parcelas de dinamica forestal permitio comparar las tasas de crecimiento y mortalidad de especies con presencia o sin ella de nectarios extraflorales. Aislando las relaciones filogeneticas entre estas especies, no se encontraron relaciones demograficas asociadas con la presencia de nectarios extraflorales, sugiriendo que factores demograficos influyen poco en el efecto ecologico a nivel de poblaciones.Resumen a traves de la comparacion de nuestro estudio sobre la presencia de nectarios extraflorales en bosques tropicales, se pudo observar que familias de arboles con nectarios son abundantes y poseen alto numero de especies, sugiriendo que el exito evolutivo de estos clados puede estar influenciado por beneficios asociados a la presencia de los nectarios extraflorales. Este estudio no pudo detectar un impacto positivo o negativo de estos beneficios en individuos con 1cm>DAP, pero se sugiere que cualquier beneficio en el rendimiento de estas especies debe ser mayor en los estadios de plantulas y juveniles donde los impactos negativos por herbivoria son mayores.

AB We assessed the short-term effects of biotic (density, plant size) and abiotic factors (light), on the dynamics of physiognomically different plant groups (palms, tree ferns, lianas, and trees) in a hurricane-impacted tropical wet montane forest, John Crow Mountains, Jamaica. All plants 2cm (dbh) found within 45, 25x25m permanent sample plots (2.8125ha), established according to a randomized block design along an elevation gradient, were tagged and measured (dbh) in 2006 and re-assessed in 2012 after Hurricane Dean (2007). Hemispheric light was measured in 2007 and 2008. Tree and liana size class distributions changed due to high mortality in the smallest size classes and their densities declined; however, palm and tree fern density remained unchanged. The dynamics of trees were only related to tree fern and liana dynamics (e.g., tree mortality was negatively related to liana recruitment etc.). Although pre- and posthurricane light was related to palm density and the density of the other plant groups, respectively, there were no significant changes in light. Tree survivorship increased with increasing dbh while posthurricane light and overall density influenced the growth and survivorship of tree species. Species importance value did not change, suggesting that direct regeneration may be the model of forest recovery following this small-scale disturbance. Over the short term, tree species showed life history trade-offs that aid species coexistence after this moderate/low disturbance event. Our study highlights that hurricanes with low impacts can have differential short- and possibly long-term effects on different plant groups.

AB Thousands of plant species throughout tropical and temperate zones secrete extrafloral nectar to attract ants, whose presence provides an indirect defense against herbivores. Extrafloral nectaries are located close to flowers and may modify competition between ants and pollinators. Here, we used Lima bean (Phaseolus lunatus L.) to study the plants interaction between ants and flower visitors and its consequences for plant fitness. To test these objectives, we carried out two field experiments in which we manipulated the presence of ants and nectar production via induction with jasmonic acid (JA). We then measured floral and extrafloral nectar production, the number of patrolling ants and flower visitors as well as specific plant fitness traits. Lima bean plants under JA induction produced more nectar in both extrafloral nectaries and flowers, attracted more ants and produced more flowers and seeds than non-induced plants. Despite an increase in floral nectar in JA plants, application of this hormone had no significant effects on flower visitor attraction. Finally, ant presence did not result in a decrease in the number of visits, but our results suggest that ants could negatively affect pollination efficiency. In particular, JA-induced plants without ants produced a greater number of seeds compared with the JA-treated plants with ants.
   Resumen Miles de especies de plantas en zonas tropicales y templadas producen nectar extra floral con el fin de atraer hormigas, cuya presencia representa una defensa indirecta contra los herbivoros. Los nectarios extra florales se encuentran cerca de las flores y pueden generar conflictos entre hormigas y polinizadores. En el presente estudio utilizamos plantas de frijol Lima (Phaseolus lunatus L.) para investigar la interaccion entre hormigas y los visitantes de flores y sus consecuencias para la adecuacion de las plantas. Se llevaron a cabo dos experimentos en los cuales manipulamos la presencia de hormigas y la produccion de nectar a traves de la induccion con acido jasmonico. Se midio la produccion de nectar floral y extra floral, el numero de hormigas que patrullaban las plantas y el numero de visitantes florales, asi como algunos caracteres de las plantas. Las plantas inducidas con acido jasmonico produjeron mas nectar en ambas estructuras, atrajeron mas hormigas y produjeron mas flores y semillas que las plantas control, no inducidas. A pesar del aumento en el nectar floral en plantas inducidas con acido jasmonico, la aplicacion de esta hormona no tuvo efectos significativos sobre la atraccion de los polinizadores. Por ultimo, la presencia de hormigas no tuvo un efecto significativo sobre la abundancia de polinizadores. Sin embargo, nuestros resultados sugieren que la presencia de hormigas puede afectar negativamente la eficiencia de los polinizadores. Especificamente, las plantas inducidas con acido jasmonico en las que se excluyeron las hormigas, produjeron mas semillas que las plantas inducidas pero con presencia hormigas.

AB Analysis of plant-frugivore interactions provides a quantitative framework for integrating community structure and ecosystem function in terms of how the roles and attributes of individual species contribute to network structure and resilience. In this study, we used centrality metrics to rank and detect the most important species in a mutualistic network of fruit-eating birds and plants in a cloud forest in the Colombian Andes. We identified a central core of ten bird and seven plant species in a network of 135 species that perform dual roles as local hubs and connectors. The birds were mostly large forest frugivores, such as cracids, cotingas, and toucans, which consume fruits of all sizes. The plants were species of intermediate successional stages with small- to medium-sized seeds that persist in mature forest or forest borders (e.g., Miconia, Cecropia, Ficus). We found the resilience of our network depends on super-generalist species, because their elimination makes the network more prone to disassemble than random extinctions, potentially disrupting seed-dispersal processes. At our study site, extirpation of large frugivores has already been documented, and if this continues, the network might collapse despite its high diversity. Our results suggest that generalist species play critical roles in ecosystem function and should be incorporated into conservation and monitoring programs.
   Resumen Las interacciones planta-frugivoro proveen un marco de referencia cuantitativo para integrar la estructura de las comunidades con las funciones ecosistemicas, al identificar los roles y atributos de especies individuales y su contribucion a la estructura y resiliencia de la red. En este estudio, clasificamos las especies usando indices de centralidad para detectar las especies mas importantes en una red de interacciones mutualista compuesta por aves frugivoras y plantas en un bosque nublado de los andes de Colombia. Identificamos un grupo central de diez aves y siete plantas en una red de 135 especies, que realizan la doble funcion de actuar como nodos locales y conectores. Las aves fueron en su mayoria frugivoras grandes como cracidos, cotingas y tucanes que consumen frutos de todos los tamanos. Las plantas fueron especies de etapas intermedias de sucesion con semillas pequenas a medianas que persisten en bosques maduros o bordes (ej. Miconia, Cecropia, Ficus). Encontramos que la resiliencia de nuestra red depende de las especies super-generalistas, porque su eliminacion hace mas posible el colapso de la red que las extinciones aleatorias, irrumpiendo potencialmente los procesos de dispersion de semillas. En nuestro sitio de estudio ya se han documentado extinciones locales de grandes aves frugivoras, y si su perdida continua la red puede colapsar a pesar de ser altamente diversa. Nuestros resultados sugieren que las especies generalistas juegan roles importantes para el funcionamiento de los ecosistemas y deben ser incorporadas en programas de conservacion y monitoreo que prevengan la perdida de fauna y mantengan la conectividad del bosque a nivel del paisaje con un mosaico de estados sucesionales.

AB Intensification of land-use threatens biodiversity, especially in tropical ecosystems that harbor the planet's highest species richness. This negative impact of anthropogenic disturbance on species numbers is well established, but the mechanisms underlying the community assembly processes are less well understood. Termites are of fundamental importance in tropical ecosystems where they are critical for nutrient recycling and species diversity. We tested the impact of anthropogenic disturbance on termite species diversity and assembly processes in a West African savanna applying the newest techniques of phylogenetic community analyses. Species richness dropped in areas of intensive land-use and compositional similarity between intensive land-use areas was high. This contrasted with a protected National Park where communities were characterized by high species richness and intermediate species turnover between sites. Slightly disturbed areas in the buffer zone surrounding the park were intermediate, they still had high species richness but similarity between sites increased. Strikingly, the assembly pattern also changed with disturbance from more phylogenetic overdispersion to more clustering (coexisting species became phylogenetically more similar), but only when the fungus-growing termite Macrotermes bellicosus was absent. Our data suggest that the major forces structuring termite communities depend: (1) on the presence of this dominant mound-building termite; and (2) that they change to more environmental filtering with disturbance. Anthropogenic disturbance seems to function as a filter that allows only a specific subset of species to occur. Such an effect might be widespread in ecology but it is difficult to document quantitatively. Phylogenetic community analyses can help to contribute such evidence.
   Zusammenfassung Die Intensivierung der Landnutzung bedroht die Artenvielfalt besonders in tropischen okosystemen, die den weltweit gro ss ten Artenreichtum beherbergen. Dieser negative Einfluss anthropogener Storung auf Artenzahlen ist gut bekannt, weniger wissen wir jedoch uber seine Wirkung auf die Mechanismen, die die Artenzusammensetzung steuern. Termiten sind von fundamentaler Bedeutung in tropischen okosystemen, wo sie eine ma ss gebliche Rolle im Nahrstoffkreislauf, fur die Bodenfruchtbarkeit und fur die generelle Artenvielfalt spielen. Wir haben die Wirkung von anthropogener Storung auf die Artenvielfalt von Termiten und die Regulationsprozesse der Zusammensetzung von Termitengemeinschaften unter Anwendung neuester Methoden phylogenetischer Gemeinschaftsanalysen untersucht. Die Artenvielfalt sank in Gegenden intensiver Landnutzung stark und die Ahnlichkeit der Zusammensetzung zwischen den untersuchten Flachen war hoch. Dies stand in deutlichem Gegensatz zu einem geschutzten Nationalpark, in dem die Termitengemeinschaften durch eine hohe Artenvielfalt und mittlere ,turnover'-Raten zwischen den Flachen charakterisiert waren. Leicht gestorte Areale in der Pufferzone des Nationalparks lagen dazwischen. Sie wiesen noch eine hohe Artenvielfalt auf, wobei die Ahnlichkeit zwischen den Flachen aber erhoht war. Auffallig ist, dass sich das Muster der Artenzusammensetzung mit steigender Storung von einer eher phylogenetischen uberverteilung zu einer starkeren phylogenetischen Klumpung anderte (d.h. koexistierende Arten waren bei Storung phylogenetisch naher verwandt als ohne Storung), aber nur wenn die pilzzuchtende Termitenart Macrotermes bellicosus fehlte. Dies deutet daraufhin, dass die Mechanismen, die die Artengemeinschaften strukturieren, abhangen von (1) der Anwesenheit dieser dominanten Hugel-bauenden Termite und (2) dass Storung zu einem starkeren Einfluss von , Umweltfilterung' fuhrt. Anthropogene Storung scheint als Filter zu wirken, der es nur bestimmten Arten erlaubt vorzukommen. Solch ein Effekt konnte in der okologie weit verbreitet sein, er ist jedoch quantitativ schwer nachzuweisen. Phylogenetische Analysen von Artengemeinschaften konnen erheblich dazu beitragen, Hinweise zu liefern.

AB The sets of species in animal and plant communities often comprise nested subsets of the species in broader communities. Although most mechanisms causing nested patterns are known and have been demonstrated for different environments and taxa, how amphibian communities are structured in ephemeral ponds in tropical disturbed landscapes remains unknown. We investigated if pond size, duration, presence of trees (local factors), and the proportion of forest cover surrounding ponds (landscape factor) affect anuran species richness and composition, and if pond assemblages showed a nested pattern. We sampled 11 ephemeral ponds in a pasture matrix near a large Atlantic Forest remnant in Brazil and measured local and landscape variables inside two buffer zones around each pond (100 and 500m). We marked 1514 individuals from 23 anuran species, and found that richness in ponds ranged from 3-14 species. Both local and landscape factors explained frog species richness in the sampled ponds, and seemed to affect community composition. Frog communities occurred in a non-nested pattern, contrary to our expectations: species found in poor subsets were not found in larger, more complex ponds. Local and landscape characteristics create a variety of environments in ephemeral ponds, even in impoverished ones; these characteristics restrict pond occupancy for some species, and result in a non-nested pattern.
   Resumo Os conjuntos de especies em comunidades animais e vegetais muitas vezes compreendem subconjuntos aninhados das especies em comunidades mais amplas. Embora a maioria dos mecanismos causadores de padroes aninhados sejam conhecidos e ja tenham sido demonstrados para diferentes tipos de ambientes e taxons, ainda e desconhecido como as comunidades de anfibios estAo estruturadas em pocas temporarias em paisagens tropicais perturbadas. Investigamos se o tamanho da poca, sua duracAo e a presenca de arvores (fatores locais) e a proporcAo de cobertura florestal no entorno das pocas (fator da paisagem) afetariam a riqueza e composicAo de especies de anuros e se as assembleias das pocas apresentam um padrAo aninhado. Amostramos 11 pocas temporarias em uma matriz de pasto proxima a um grande remanescente florestal de Mata Atlantica no Brasil. As variaveis locais e da paisagem foram medidas dentro de duas zonas-tampAo consideradas ao redor de cada poca (100 and 500m). Foram marcados um total de 1514 individuos de 23 especies de anuros, e a riqueza nas pocas variou de tres a 14 especies. Ambas variaveis locais e da paisagem explicaram a riqueza de especies de anfibios nas pocas amostradas, e parece tambem afetar a composicAo da comunidade. As comunidades de anfibios estavam estruturadas em um padrAo nAo aninhado, contrario ao esperado por nos: especies encontradas em subconjuntos com poucas especies nAo foram encontradas nas pocas maiores e mais complexas. Caracteristicas locais e da paisagem criam uma variedade de ambientes em pocas temporarias, mesmo nas mais empobrecidas, o que impoe uma restricAo a ocupacAo de pocas por algumas especies, e resulta em um padrAo nAo aninhado.

AB Invasive species pose one of the greatest threats to biodiversity. This study investigates the extent to which human disturbance to natural ecosystems facilitates the spread of non-native species, focusing on a small mammal community in selectively logged rain forest, Sabah, Borneo. The microhabitat preferences of the invasive Rattus rattus and three native species of small mammal were examined in three-dimensional space by combining the spool-and-line technique with a novel method for quantifying fine-scale habitat selection. These methods allowed the detection of significant differences for each species between the microhabitats used compared with alternative, available microhabitats that were avoided. Rattus rattus showed the greatest preference for heavily disturbed habitats, and in contrast to two native small mammals of the genus Maxomys, R.rattus showed high levels of arboreal behavior, frequently leaving the forest floor and traveling through the understory and midstory forest strata. This behavior may enable R.rattus to effectively utilize the complex three-dimensional space of the lower strata in degraded forests, which is characterized by dense vegetation. The behavioral flexibility of R.rattus to operate in both terrestrial and arboreal space may facilitate its invasion into degraded forests. Human activities that generate heavily disturbed habitats preferred by R.rattus may promote the establishment of this invasive species in tropical forests in Borneo, and possibly elsewhere. We present this as an example of a synergistic effect, whereby forest disturbance directly threatens biodiversity and indirectly increases the threat posed by invasive species, creating habitat conditions that facilitate the establishment of non-native fauna.
   Abstrak Spesies invasif merupakan satu daripada ancaman utama terhadap kepelbagian biologi. Kajian ini menyelidik sejauh mana gangguan terhadap ekosistem semulajadi oleh manusia memudahkan penyebaran spesies asing dengan memberi tumpuan kepada mamalia kecil di hutan hujan tropika yang telah dibalak secara terpilih di negeri Sabah, Borneo. Pemilihan habitat-mikro spesies invasif Rattus rattus dan tiga spesies mamalia kecil tempatan yang lain telah diselidik dalam ruang tiga dimensi dengan menggunakan gabungan kaedah spool-dan-benang dan satu kaedah baharu untuk menentukan secara kuantitatif pemilihan habitat pada skala kecil. Kaedah-kaedah ini memungkinkan pengesanan perbezaan yang signifikan dari segi habitat-mikro yang digunakan oleh setiap spesies mamalia kecil yang dikaji berbanding dengan habitat-mikro yang tidak digunakan oleh spesies-spesies yang berkenaan. Rattus rattus menunjukkan pemilihan paling ketara terhadap habitat yang sangat terganggu. Ini berbeza daripada dua spesies mamalia kecil tempatan yang lain iaitu dari genus Maxomys, yang mana R.rattus menunjukkan kelakuan arboreal yang sangat tinggi, dan spesies ini kerap meninggalkan bahagian lantai hutan dan bergerak melalui strata hutan bawah dan hutan pertengahan. Kelakuan ini membolehkan R.rattus menggunakan ruang tiga dimensi yang kompleks pada strata hutan bawah di habitat hutan yang terganggu, yang mana hutan ini adalah dicirkan oleh vegetasi yang sangat tebal. Fleksibiliti kelakuan R.rattus membolehkan spesies ini beroperasi di kedua-dua ruang terrestrial dan arboreal. Ini memudahkan penyebaran R.rattus di habitat hutan terganggu. Aktiviti manusia yang menghasilkan habitat yang teruk terganggu yang disukai oleh R.rattus mungkin akan mempromosi penyebaran spesies yang invasif ini di hutan tropika Borneo, dan juga tempat-tempat lain. Kami menunjukkan hasil kajian ini sebagai satu contoh kesan senergi, yang mana gangguan terhadap habitat akan mengancam kepelbagai biologi secara langsung, dan ini secara tidak langsung akan mengakibatkan peningkatan ancaman oleh spesies invasive iaitu dengan cara membina suatu keadaan habitat yang mempermudahkan penyebaran fauna asing.

AB Fungal symbioses with plants are ubiquitous, ancient, and vital to both ecosystem function and plant health. However, benefits to fungal symbionts are not well explored, especially in non-mycorrhizal fungi. The Foraging Ascomycete hypothesis proposes that some wood-decomposing fungi may shift life-history strategies to endophytism to bridge gaps in time and space between suitable substrates. To test this hypothesis we examine spatial relationships of Xylaria endophytic fungi in the forest canopy with Xylaria decomposer fungi on the forest floor. We sampled for fungi of the genus Xylaria using a spatially explicit sampling scheme in a remote Ecuadorian cloud forest, and concurrently carried out an extensive culture-based sampling of fungal foliar endophytes. We found 36 species of Xylaria in our 0.5ha plot, 31 of which were found to only occur as fruiting bodies. All five species of Xylaria found as endophytes were also found as fruiting bodies. We also tested the relationships of both stages of these fungi to environmental variables. Decomposer fungi were differentiated by species-specific habitat preferences, with three species being found closer to water than expected by chance. In contrast, endophytes displayed no sensitivity to environmental conditions, such as host, moisture, or canopy cover. We found evidence of spatial linkage between life stages in two species. We also demonstrate that direct transmission of endophytes from leaves to woody substrates is possible. These results indicate that endophytism may represent one way for decomposer fungi to escape moisture limitation, and thatendophytic fungi may act as sources of dispersal for decomposer fungi consistent with predictions of the Foraging Ascomycete hypothesis.
   Resumen Las simbiosis de plantas con hongos son ubicuas, ancestrales y vitales tanto para funciones ecosistemicas como para la salud de las plantas. Sin embargo, los beneficios a los hongos simbiontes no estan bien explorados, especialmente en hongos no micorrizicos. En este estudio examinamos las relaciones espaciales entre hongos endofitos del genero Xylaria en el dosel con los miembros descomponedores del mismo genero en el suelo, para probar la hipotesis de que algunos hongos poseen estrategias de historia de vida alternas, alternando entre estadios de vida descomponedores y endofitos para aumentar su dispersion y resistir escasez de recursos, conocida como la Hipotesis del Ascomiceto Forrajero. Muestreamos miembros del genero Xylaria usando un muestreo espacial explicito en un bosque de niebla remoto en Ecuador, y llevamos a cabo un muestreo extensivo de hongos endofitos foliares usando cultivos. Encontramos 36 especies de Xylaria en nuestro sitio de 0.5ha. De estas, 31 especies estuvieron presentes solamente como hongos descomponedores. Asimismo, todos los Xylaria endofitos fueron encontrados fueron encontrados como descomponedores. Evaluamos las relaciones entre ambos estadios de estos hongos con variables ambientales. Los hongos descomponedores se diferenciaron por preferencias de habitat especificas para cada especie, pero los endofitos no mostraron sensibilidad a condiciones ambientales, como humedad o cobertura del dosel. Encontramos evidencia de vinculacion espacial entre los estadios de vida en dos especies. En conjunto, nuestros resultados indican que el endofitismo podria representar un medio de escape de los hongos descomponedores a las limitaciones de humedad, y que los hongos endofitos pueden actuar como fuentes de dispersion para los hongos descomponedores, apoyando la Hipotesis del Ascomiceto Forrajero.

AB Human-wildlife conflicts create collateral damage when people attempt to control one problematic species and inadvertently kill others. I observed a collateral damage problem in southern Costa where people seeking to control common vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) indiscriminately killed sympatric, non-target bat species (e.g., by baiting bats with poisoned bananas). To learn about this phenomenon and its causes, I developed and implemented a questionnaire based on the theory of planned behavior. In a sample of 504 men, 14 percent had individually killed 1-115 bats within the past 5yr, 68 percent had killed bats as children, and 27 percent said that they would kill bats that they found roosting on their farms, even if they could not identify the species. Men who intended to indiscriminately kill bats thought that it would reduce disease transmission to livestock, whereas men who did not intend to kill bats thought that killing bats would reduce ecosystem functioning and/or damage nature. Ultimately, men were more likely to intend to indiscriminately kill bats if they knew less about bat natural history and/or had previously suffered vampire bats attacking their livestock. Men knew more about bat natural history and were less likely to harbor indiscriminate bat-killing intentions if they had experienced some form of environmental education. My results suggest that environmental education will be most effective for bat conservation when combined with farmer support to ameliorate perceived livelihood risks associated with vampire bats.
   Resumen Los conflictos entre humanos y animales silvestres hacen danos colaterales cuando la gente tiene la intencion de controlar una especie problematica y mata otras inadvertidamente. Observe un problema de dano colateral en el sur de Costa Rica donde la gente con la intencion de controlar los vampiros comunes (Desmodus rotundus) mataba indiscriminadamente especies simpatricas y no-objetivas (e.g., por atraer murcielagos con bananas envenenadas). Para aprender sobre este fenomeno y sus causas, desarrolle e implemente un cuestionario basado en la teoria de comportamiento planificado. En una muestra de 504 hombres, el 14 por ciento habia matado individualmente 1-115 murcielagos entre los ultimos cinco anos, el 68 por ciento habia matado a murcielagos cuando eran ninos, y el 27 por ciento menciono matarian a los murcielagos si los encuentren en sus fincas, incluso si no podian identificarlos. Los hombres que tenian la intencion de matar los murcielagos indiscriminadamente pensaban que iba reducir la transmision de enfermedades a la ganaderia, mientras que hombres que no tenian la intencion de matar los murcielagos pensaban que matar murcielagos reduciria las funciones ecosistemicas y/o haria danos a la naturaleza. Ultimadamente, los hombres fueron mas probables a tener la intencion de matar murcielagos indiscriminadamente si sabian menos sobre la historia natural de los murcielagos y si habian sufridos por los murcielagos vampiros atacando a sus ganados. Hombres sabian mas sobre la historia natural de murcielagos y eran menos propensos a tener intenciones de matar murcielagos indiscriminadamente si habian tenidos alguna experiencia de educacion ambiental. Los resultados sugieren que la educacion ambiental deberia ser mas eficaz para la conservacion de murcielagos cuando se combina con apoyo a los ganaderos para aminorar los riesgos percibidos del sustento asociado con los murcielagos vampiros.

AB Hunting and trade of wild animals for their meat (bushmeat), especially mammals, is commonplace in tropical forests worldwide. In West and Central Africa, bushmeat extraction has increased substantially during recent decades. Currently, such levels of hunting pose a major threat to native wildlife. In this paper, we compiled published data on hunting offtake of mammals, from a number of studies conducted between 1990 and 2007 in Cameroon, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, and Republic of Congo. From these data sources, we estimated annual extraction rates of all hunted species and analyzed the relationship between environmental and anthropogenic variables surrounding each hunting rate and levels of bushmeat extraction. We defined hunting pressure as a function of bushmeat offtake and number of hunted species and confirm that hunting pressure is significantly correlated with road density, distance to protected areas and population density. These correlations are then used to map hunting pressure across the Congo Basin. We show that predicted risk areas show a patchy distribution throughout the study region and that many protected areas are located in high-risk areas. We suggest that such a map can be used to identify areas of greatest impact of hunting to guide large-scale conservation planning initiatives for central Africa.
   Resume La chasse et le commerce d'animaux sauvages pour la viande de brousse, en particulier les mammiferes, sont des activites courantes dans les forets tropicales a travers le monde. En Afrique occidentale et centrale, l'extraction de la viande de brousse a considerablement augmente au cours des dernieres decennies. Actuellement, cette pression de chasse significative constitue une menace majeure pour la faune indigene. Dans cet article, nous avons compile les donnees publiees sur le prelevement de la chasse des mammiferes, a partir d'un certain nombre d'etudes effectuees entre 1990 et 2007 au Cameroun, en Republique Centrafricaine, en Republique Democratique du Congo, en Guinee Equatoriale, au Gabon et en Republique du Congo. Au regard de ces donnees, nous avons estime les taux d'extraction annuels de toutes les especes chassees, ainsi que la relation des variables environnementales et anthropiques par rapport au taux de chasse et aux niveaux d'extraction de la viande de brousse. Nous avons defini la pression de chasse en fonction du prelevement de la viande de brousse et le nombre d'especes chassees et ainsi nous avons pu confirmer que la pression de chasse est significativement correlee avec la densite routiere, la distance aux aires protegees et la densite de population. Ces correlations ont ensuite ete utilisees pour cartographier la pression de chasse a travers le bassin du Congo. Ainsi, nous avons demontre que les zones a risque predites revelent une distribution inegale dans toute la region d'etude et que de nombreuses aires protegees sont situees dans des zones a haut risque. C'est pourquoi nous suggerons qu'une telle carte puisse etre utilisee pour identifier les zones de grand impact de la chasse afin de guider les initiatives de planification de la conservation a grande echelle pour l'Afrique centrale.

AB Forest restoration is an increasingly important tool to offset and indeed reverse global deforestation rates. One low cost strategy to accelerate forest recovery is conserving scattered native trees that persist across disturbed landscapes and which may act as seedling recruitment foci. Ficus trees, which are considered to be critically important components of tropical ecosystems, may be particularly attractive to seed dispersers in that they produce large and nutritionally rewarding fruit crops. Here, we evaluate the effectiveness of remnant Ficus trees in inducing forest recovery compared to other common trees. We studied the sapling communities growing under 207 scattered trees, and collected data on seed rain for 55 trees in a modified landscape in Assam, India. We found that Ficus trees have more sapling species around them (species richness=140.19.9) than non-Ficus trees (79.5 +/- 12.9), and significantly more saplings of shrub and large tree species. Sapling densities were twice as high under Ficus trees (median=0.06/m(2)) compared to non-Ficus (0.03/m(2)), and seed rain densities of non-parent trees were significantly higher under Ficus trees (mean=12.73 +/- 3/m(2)/wk) than other fruit or non-zoochorous trees (2.19 +/- 0.97/m(2)/wk). However, our regression model found that canopy area, used as a proxy for tree size, was the primary predictor of sapling density, followed by remnant tree type. These results suggest that large trees, and in particular large Ficus trees, may be more effective forest restoration agents than other remnant trees in disturbed landscapes, and therefore the conservation of these trees should be prioritized.

AB The adaptive significance of red coloration in tropical forest leaves remains unclear. In vivo assays show that there is a significant negative correlation between anthocyanin pigments in young leaves and fungal pathogen damage. This supports a previous hypothesis that anthocyanins may protect young leaves from fungal damage during the vulnerable period of leaf expansion.
   Resumen El significado adaptativo de coloracion roja en las hojas de los bosques tropicales sigue siendo poco claro. Ensayos invivo muestran que existe una correlacion negativa significativa entre los pigmentos de antocianina en hojas jovenes rojas y danos por un hongo patogeno. Esto sugiere que las antocianinas pueden proteger a las hojas durante el periodo vulnerable de expansion.

AB The aim of this study is to represent simultaneously changes in the spatial distribution of the Atlantic forest during the last 17,000years. To characterize such changes, here we focused on three different forest physiognomies, evergreen, semi-deciduous, and Araucaria, and we provide a list of indicator taxa for each class retrieved from the original published datasets. A review of the published fossil pollen records allowed us to classify regional behaviors in three main areas of distribution, north of 15 degrees S, between 15 degrees and 23 degrees S and south of 23 degrees S latitude that correspond to three climatic geographical barriers. Statistical probability density function method was used to illustrate changes in forest physiognomies throughout the three distribution areas. We show that the three modern barriers also functioned through the past. Asynchronous patterns of forest physiognomies are linked to an antiphasing pattern of monsoon precipitation between the northern and central area, whereas in the southern area, it is linked to the frequency and intensity of the polar advection in the subtropics. Our results attest to strong climate forcing on forest distribution between the late glacial and the interglacial period. They call into question the common reference to the last glacial maximum as a major (and sometimes as the only) driver of forest-related vicariance and genetic diversity patterns, but suggest that instead, orbital cycles were the main drivers of the successive expansion/contraction of the Atlantic forest throughout the Quaternary.
   Resumo Mais conhecimento sobre a historia bioclimatica da Mata Atlantica (brasileira) - um dos ecossistemas Neotropicais mais diversos e ameacados - politicas de conservacAo adequadas as mudancas climaticas devem ser urgentemente avaliadas. Direcionamos nosso foco para tres tipos diferentes de fisionomias florestais: floresta perene, floresta semi-decidua e floresta com Araucaria, alem de fornecer uma lista de taxons indicadores para cada um dos tipos florestais obtida de bancos de dados originais publicados. Uma revisAo de registros palinologicos e de espeleotemas publicados datando desde o ultimo maximo glacial nos permitiu distinguir comportamentos regionais em tres principais areas de distribuicAo: ao norte de 15 degrees S, entre 23 e 15 degrees S e ao sul de 23 degrees S de latitude. Estas areas de distribuicAo correspondem a tres barreiras climaticas definidas pelo periodo e duracAo da estacAo chuvosa (permanente na regiAo mais ao sul, curta e durante o verAo na regiAo central e durante o inverno na regiAo mais ao norte). Usamos entAo o metodo da funcAo de densidade de probabilidade estatistica para ilustrar mudancas na fisionomia florestal, fragmentacAo e deslocamentos espaciais ao longo dos ultimos 17,000 anos nestas tres areas de distribuicAo. Nos constatamos que as tres barreiras climaticas atuais tambem estiveram ativas no passado e provavelmente criaram as caracteristicas filogeograficas observadas atualmente. Os padroes assincronos dos movimentos florestais evidenciados entre a Mata Atlantica do norte e central estiveram relacionados com um padrAo antiphasing de precipitacAo de moncAo, enquanto que os da Mata Atlantica ao sul estiveram relacionados com a frequencia e intensidade da adveccAo polar nos subtropios. Nossos resultados indicam uma forte influencia do clima na distribuicAo das florestas entre o glacial tardio e o interglacial. Esse fato confronta a opiniAo formada de que o ultimo maximo glacial seria o maior (e algumas vezes o unico) condutor de vicariancia para florestas e padroes de diversidade genetica e sugere que os ciclos orbitais seriam os principais condutores de sucessivos intervalos de expansAo/contracAo da Mata Atlantica durante o Quaternario.

AB In the last decades, due to human land management that uses fire as a tool, and due to abnormal droughts, many tropical forests have become more susceptible to recurrent wildfires with negative consequences for biodiversity. Yet, studies are usually focused on few taxa and rarely compare different fire frequencies. We examined if the effects of single and recurrent fires are consistent for leaf litter ants, dung beetles, birds (sampled with point-counts PC and mist net-MN), saplings, and trees. Recurrent fires had a great effect on forest structure, reducing live tree biomass and number of lianas, and increasing canopy openness and numbers of saplings alive. Recurrent fires had consistently stronger effects on species richness and composition across all sample groups than single fires, except ants. Birds and plants were more grouped in the congruence analysis. The average dissimilarities between control and recurrent-burned forest were higher than between control and once-burned forest for all sample groups, furthermore birds and vegetation communities in recurrent-burned forest are almost entirely dissimilar from the unburned forest. While beta diversity of ants, birds (MN), and trees was not affected by the frequency of fire, it changed for dung beetles, birds (PC), and saplings. Effects of fire on faunal community structure were more due to indirect effects, through vegetation, than through the fire itself. These results reinforce the effect of single and recurrent fires on tropical forests, and highlight the mechanisms acting behind them. Policy-makers need to explicitly address protection of tropical forests from wildfires in conservation planning.
   Resumo Nas ultimas decadas, devido ao uso do fogo como ferramenta de manejo da terra, e devido a estacoes secas longas anormais, muitas florestas tropicais tem se tornado mais susceptiveis ao fogo recorrente, com consequencias negativas para a biodiversidade. Entretanto, os estudos sAo normalmente focados em poucos taxa e raramente comparam frequencias diferentes de fogo. Nos avaliamos se os efeitos do fogo simples e recorrente sAo consistentes para formigas de serapilheira, besouros de esterco, aves (amostradas com pontos de escuta-PE e redes de neblina-RN), plantulas e arvores. O fogo recorrente teve um grante efeito sobre a estrutura da floresta, reduzindo a biomassa viva e o numero de cipos, e aumentando a abertura do dossel e o numero de plantulas. O fogo recorrente teve um efeito consistentemente maior do que o fogo simples sobre a riqueza e a composicAo de especies em todos os grupos amostrais, com excecAo das formigas. Aves e plantas apresentaram maior agrupamento na analise de congruencia. A dissimilaridade media entre floresta controle e floresta com fogo recorrente foi maior do que entre floresta controle e floresta com fogo simples para todos os grupos amostrais, e as comunidades de aves e de plantas em geral foram quase totalmente dissimilares da floresta nAo-queimada. Apesar da diversidade beta de formigas, aves (RN) e arvores nAo ter sido afetada pela frequencia de fogo, ela mudou em besouros de esterco, aves (PE) e plantulas. Os efeitos do fogo sobre a estrutura da comunidade da fauna foram mais devido aos efeitos indiretos, atraves das mudancas na vegetacAo, do que aos efeitos do fogo propriamente dito. Estes resultados reforcam os efeitos do fogo simples e recorrente sobre a florestas tropicais e destacam os mecanismos que agem por tras deles.

AB The Cerrado (Brazilian savanna) is a biodiversity hotspot with a history of fire that goes back as far as 10million years. Fire has influenced the evolution of several aspects of the vegetation, including reproduction and life cycles. This study tested how fire by-products such as heat and smoke affect the germination of six species common to two Cerrado open physiognomies: wet grasslands and the campo sujo (grassland with scattered shrubs and dwarf trees). We subjected seeds collected in northern Brazil to heat shock and smoke treatments, both separately and combined, using different temperatures, exposure times, and smoke concentrations in aqueous solutions. High temperatures and smoke did not break seed dormancy nor stimulate germination of the Cerrado study species. However, seeds were not killed by high temperatures, indicating that they are fire-tolerant. Our findings differed from those of other fire-prone ecosystems (mostly of Mediterranean vegetation), where fire stimulates germination. Moreover, we provide important information regarding germination strategies of non-woody Cerrado plants, showing the importance of considering the tolerance of seeds to high temperatures when evaluating fire-related traits in fire-prone ecosystems.

Diversos aspectos da vegetacAo, incluindo a reproducAo e os ciclos de vida de diferentes especies, estAo relacionados a coexistencia com o fogo.
   ObjetivosEsse estudo tem como objetivo elucidar o efeito do calor e da fumaca na germinacAo de seis especies comuns em duas fisionomias abertas do Cerrado: campo umido e campo sujo.

   Resultados ImportantesAltas temperaturas e fumaca nAo quebraram a dormencia nem estimularam a germinacAo das especies de Cerrado estudadas. Entretanto, as sementes nAo foram mortas pelas altas temperaturas, indicando sua tolerancia ao fogo. Nossos resultados se diferenciam daqueles de realizados em outros ecossistemas pirofiticos (especialmente sobre a vegetacAo mediterranea), nos quais o fogo estimula a germinacAo. Alem disso, o estudo prove informacoes importantes sobre estrategias de germinacAo de plantas nAo lenhosas do Cerrado e mostra a importancia de se considerar a tolerancia de sementes a altas temperaturas para o estabelecimento de estrategias de manejo em ecossistemas sujeitos a queimadas.

AB The timing and frequency of flowering and fruiting events are key tropical forest characteristics that have substantial influence on fauna. Although our understanding of geographic variation in habitat-wide timing and frequency of flowering and fruiting is advancing, corresponding information for individual tree species is limited. Thus, we compared climate and reproductive phenology of 16 tree species over 70 mo at two Bornean tropical peat-swamp forest sites. We found significant inter-site correlations in rainfall and temperature, and only small absolute temperature differences. In both sites, most species exhibited within-site synchrony in flowering and fruiting onset. Broad-scale flowering and fruiting onset frequency classifications showed high congruence between sites. Significant correlations in flowering and fruiting onset timing between sites were found for only 19 and 17 percent of the species, respectively. This remained the case when applying 1- and 2-month lag periods for both sites, with neither site consistently lagging behind. Significant differences in the exact frequency of new flowering and fruiting events were detected for 44 and 58 percent of species, respectively, and no significant relationships between the onset timing synchrony and exact frequency of new reproductive events were found for either flowers or fruit. We conclude that inter-site climatic and ecological similarities do not necessarily lead to high inter-site synchrony in either onset timing or exact frequency of tree reproductive events. Potential reasons for this are discussed, as are the implications for understanding tropical forest ecology and improving forest restoration project seed collections.
   Abstrak Waktu dan frekuensi peristiwa berbunga dan berbuah adalah karakteristik utama hutan tropis yang berpengaruh besar pada fauna. Pemahaman kita mengenai variasi geografis waktu berdasarkan habitat dan frekuensi peristiwa berbunga dan berbuah memang semakin maju namun informasi terkait mengenai masing-masing jenis pohon masih terbatas. Oleh sebab itu kami membandingkan iklim dan fenologi reproduksi dari 16 jenis pohon selama 70 bulan di dua lokasi hutan rawa gambut tropis di Kalimantan. Kami menemukan korelasi signifikan antara curah hujan dan suhu antarlokasi, dan hanya ada perbedaan kecil dalam hal suhu mutlak. Di kedua situs, sebagian besar spesies menunjukkan keserempakan waktu permulaan peristiwa berbunga dan berbuah di dalam situs masing-masing. Klasifikasi frekuensi waktu permulaan berbunga dan berbuah dalam skala luas menunjukkan kesesuaian yang tinggi antarlokasi. Korelasi signifikan dalam hal waktu permulaan peristiwa berbunga dan berbuah antarlokasi hanya ditemukan berturut-turut dalam 19 dan 17 persen spesies. Hal ini tetap sama meskipun diterapkan 1 dan 2 bulan periode kelambatan pada kedua lokasi, dan tidak ada yang secara konsisten tertinggal. Perbedaan signifikan dalam hal frekuensi tepat dari peristiwa berbunga dan berbuah ditemukan secara berurut pada 44 dan 58 persen spesies, dan tidak ada hubungan yang signifikan antara keserempakan waktu permulaan dan frekuensi tepat dari peristiwa-peristiwa reproduksi baru yang ditemukan baik untuk bunga maupun buah. Kami menyimpulkan bahwa keserupaan ekologi dan iklim antarlokasi tidak selalu mengakibatkan keserempakan yang tinggi antarlokasi, baik dalam waktu permulaan maupun frekuensi tepat dari peristiwa-peristiwa reproduktif pohon. Berbagai alasan potensial yang menyebabkannya dibahas dalam tulisan ini, demikian pula beragam implikasinya, untuk memahami ekologi hutan tropis dan meningkatkan proyek restorasi hutan melalui koleksi benih.

AB The outcome of any interspecific interaction is often determined by the ecological context in which the interacting species are embedded. Plant ontogeny may represent an important source of variation in the outcome of ant-plant mutualisms, as the level of investment in ant rewards, in alternative (non-biotic) defenses, or both, may be modulated by the plant's developmental stage. In addition, the abundance and identities of the ants involved in the interaction may change during ontogeny of the host-plant. Here, we evaluated if plant ontogeny affects the interaction between ants and a savanna tree species (Caryocar brasiliense) that produces extrafloral nectar. We found fewer ants per branch and fewer species of ants per tree in juvenile than in reproductive trees of medium and large size. In addition, large-sized reproductive trees were more likely to host more aggressive ants than were medium-sized reproductive or juvenile trees. Such differences strongly affected the outcome of the interaction between ants and their host-plants, as the magnitude of the effect of ants on herbivory was much stronger for large trees than for juvenile ones. The fact that we did not find significant ontogenetic variation in the concentration of leaf tannins suggests that the observed differences in herbivory did not result from a differential investment in chemical defenses among different-sized plants. Overall, the results of our study indicate that the developmental stage of the host plant is an important factor of conditionality in the interaction between C.brasiliense and arboreal foraging ants.
   Resumo O resultado de uma interacAo interespecifica e muitas vezes determinado pelo contexto ecologico no qual as especies que interagem estAo incorporados. A ontogenia das plantas pode representar uma importante fonte de variacAo nos resultados de mutualismos obrigatorios entre plantas e formigas, a medida que o nivel de investimento em beneficios das formigas, nas defesas alternativas (nAo-bioticas), ou ambos, podem ser modulados pela fase de desenvolvimento das plantas. Aqui nos avaliamos se a ontogenia da planta hospedeira afeta a interacAo entre formigas e uma arvore produtora de nectar extrafloral comum do cerrado (Caryocar brasiliense). Nos encontramos menos formigas por ramo e menos especies de formigas por planta em arvores juvenis do que em arvores reprodutivas de medio e grande porte. Em adicAo, plantas reprodutivas de grande porte foram mais suscetiveis de hospedar formigas mais agressivas do que as arvores reprodutivas de medio porte ou juvenis. Tais diferencas afetaram fortemente o resultado da interacAo entre formigas e suas plantas hospedeiras, uma vez que a magnitude do efeito protetor das formigas contra insetos folivoros foi muito maior nas arvores reprodutivas de grande porte do que em juvenis. O fato de nAo termos encontrados diferencas ontogeneticas na concentracAo de taninos foliares sugere que as diferencas observadas nAo sAo resultado de investimento diferencial em defesas quimicas entre plantas de diferentes tamanhos. No geral, os resultados do nosso estudo indicam que o estagio de desenvolvimento da planta hospedeira e um importante fator de condicionalidade na interacAo entre C.brasiliense e formigas que forrageiam nas arvores.

AB Identifying factors governing the origin, distribution, and maintenance of Neotropical plant diversity is an enduring challenge. To explore the complex and dynamic historical processes that shaped contemporary genetic patterns for a Central American plant species, we investigated the spatial distribution of chloroplast haplotypes of a geographically and environmentally widespread epiphytic bromeliad with wind-dispersed seeds, Catopsis nutans, in Costa Rica. We hypothesized that genetic discontinuities occur between northwestern and southwestern Pacific slope populations, resembling patterns reported for other plant taxa in the region. Using non-coding chloroplast DNA from 469 individuals and 23 populations, we assessed the influences of geographic and environmental distance as well as historical climatic variation on the genetic structure of populations spanning >1200m in elevation. Catopsis nutans revealed seven haplotypes with low within-population diversity (mean haplotype richness=1.2) and moderate genetic structure (F-ST=0.699). Pairwise F-ST was significantly correlated with both geographic and environmental distance. The frequency of dominant haplotypes was significantly correlated with elevation. A cluster of nine Pacific lowland populations exhibited a distinct haplotype profile and contained five of the seven haplotypes, suggesting historical isolation and limited seed-mediated gene flow with other populations. Paleodistribution models indicated lowland and upland habitats in this region were contiguous through past climatic oscillations. Based on our paleodistribution analysis and comparable prior phylogeographic studies, the genetic signature of recent climatic oscillations are likely superimposed upon the distribution of anciently divergent lineages. Our study highlights the unique phylogeographic history of a Neotropical plant species spanning an elevation gradient.
   Resumen Identificar factores que goviernan el origen, distribucion y mantenimiento de la diversidad de plantas Neotropicales es un reto continuo. Para explorar los complejos y dinamicos procesos historicos que le han dado forma a los patrones geneticos contemporanes en una especie de planta en Centro America, investigamos la distribucion espacial de haplotipos del cloroplasto de Catopsis nutans en Costa Rica, una especie ampliamente distribuida geografica y ambientalmente con semillas dispersadas por el viento. Nosotros hipotetizamos que discontinuidades geneticas en las poblacions de la vertiente Pacifica occurren entre el noroeste y el sudeste, reflejando el patron reportado en otras especies de plantas en la region. Utilizando ADN no codificante del cloroplasto de 469 individuos en 23 poblaciones, evaluamos la influencia de la distancia geografica y ambiental, asi como la variacion climatica historica sobre la estructura genetica de las poblacions situadas a>1200m de elevacion. Catopsis nutans revelo siete haplotipos con baja diversidad intra-poblacional (riqueza de haplotipos promedio=1.2) y moderada estructura genetica (F-ST=0.699). El F-ST pareado mostro una correlacion significante tanto con geografia como con distancia ambiental. La frecuencia de haplotipos dominantes resulto significativamente correlacionada con elevacion. Un grupo de nueve poblaciones de las zonas bajas del Pacifico mostro un distinctivo perfile de haplotipos asi como cinco de los siete haplotipos, sugiriendo aislamiento historico y limitado flujo genetico mediado por semillas con las otras poblaciones. Modelos de distribucion paleogeograficos indicant que los habitats de zonas bajas a zonas altas se encontraban unidos durante oscilaciones climaticas pasadas. Basado en nuestro analisis de paleodistribucion y comparable con previos estudios filogeograficos, la firma genetica de las oscilaciones climaticas recientes esta probablemente superimpuesta sobre la distribucion de lineajes con divergencia antigua. Nuestro estudio resalta la particular historia filogeografica de una especie de planta Neotropical distribuida a traves de un gradiente altitudinal.

AB The dietary dependence on volant aquatic insects of eight species of predatory arthropods from three different orders was determined by stable isotope analyses in combination with three-source, two-isotope (C and N) Bayesian mixing models. The predators were collected from riparian zones along three streams in tropical Hong Kong during both the wet and dry seasons. Dietary importance of aquatic insects varied according to predator hunting modes, and showed a consistent pattern across all sites during the wet season. The web-building tetragnathid spider (Orsinome diporusa) had the greatest reliance (similar to 40-55%) on this water-to-land subsidy, followed by two species of damselflies (40-50%), three cursorial spiders (Lycosidae, Pisauridae, and Sparassidae: 32-51%) and two neustic gerrids (17-36%). Such reliance also varied according to the microhabitat preferences of different cursorial spiders. Four species of predators (gerrids and cursorial spiders) that were active year-round showed generally consistent reliance on aquatic insects between seasons, which probably reflected the observed lack of seasonal variability in the relative proportions of aquatic and terrestrial prey. There was a marked overlap in isotopic signatures of aquatic and terrestrial prey at all sites which, combined with the absence of data on the extent to which isotopic fractionations may vary among individual species of prey and predators, contributes some uncertainty to the estimates of dietary compositions derived by mixing models. The findings of the present study are thus likely to be indicative rather than definitive.

AB In communities of tropical insects, adult abundance tends to fluctuate widely, perhaps in part owing to predator-prey dynamics. Yet, temporal patterns of attack rates in tropical forest habitats have not been studied systematically; the identity of predators of insects in tropical forests is poorly known; and their responses to temporal variation in prey abundance have rarely been explored. We recorded incidence and shape of marks of attacks on dummy caterpillars (proxy of predation rate) in a sub-montane tropical forest in Uganda during a yearlong experiment, and explored correlations with inferred caterpillar abundance. Applying the highest and lowest observed daily attack rates on clay dummies over a realistic duration of the larval stage of butterflies, indicates that the temporal variation in attack rate could cause more than 10-fold temporal variation in caterpillar survival. Inferred predators were almost exclusively invertebrates, and beak marks of birds were very scarce. Attack rates by wasps varied more over time than those of ants. Attack rates on dummies peaked during the two wet seasons, and appeared congruent with inferred peaks in caterpillar density. This suggests (1) a functional response (predators shifting to more abundant resource) or adaptive timed phenology (predators timing activity or breeding to coincide with seasonal peaks in prey abundance) of predators, rather than a numerical response (predator populations increasing following peaks in prey abundance); and (2) that predation would dampen abundance fluctuations of tropical Lepidoptera communities.

AB Predation is a key determinant of prey community structure, but few studies have measured the effect of multiple predators on a highly diverse prey community. In this study, we asked whether the abundance, species richness, and species composition of a species-rich assemblage of termites in an Amazonian rain forest is more strongly associated with the density of predatory ants or with measures of vegetation, and soil texture and chemistry. We sampled termite assemblages with standardized hand-collecting in 30 transects arranged in a 5kmx6km grid in a terra firme Amazonian rain forest. For each transect, we also measured vegetation structure, soil texture, and soil phosphorus, and estimated the density of predatory ants from baits, pitfall traps, and Winkler samples. Seventy-nine termite species were recorded, and the total density of predatory ants was the strongest single predictor of local termite abundance (r=-0.66) and termite species richness (r=-0.44). In contrast, termite abundance and species richness were not strongly correlated with edaphic conditions (r<0.01), or with the density of non-predatory ants (r(abund)=-0.27; r(s)=-0.06). Termite species composition was correlated with soil phosphorus content (r=0.79), clay content (r=-0.75), and tree density (r=-0.42). Assemblage patterns were consistent with the hypothesis that ants collectively behaved as generalist predators, reducing total termite abundance, and species richness. There was no evidence that ants behaved as keystone predators, or that any single termite species benefited from the reduction in the abundance of potential competitors.

AB Group living among ungulates has evolved mainly in species living in open habitats, such as grasslands and savannas, whereas in the forest, few ungulate species form groups and these tend to be small. Therefore, the white-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari), a Neotropical ungulate listed as Vulnerable by the IUCN, represents an almost unique social occurrence as it lives in large and cohesive groups, yet it inhabits dense tropical forests. Large variations in group sizes have been observed throughout the species range, with reports of herds with less than 10 to around 300 individuals. We examined factors that might cause variation in group size in white-lipped peccary, including ecological and anthropogenic variables. We conducted an extensive literature review and used our original data to compile information on white-lipped peccary's group size across its range. We built models to quantitate generalizations for group sizes distinguishing data from areas with high human influence, and areas that have not been significantly disturbed by humans for at least the last 20years. We found that white-lipped peccary's group size for all sites was most strongly predicted by a combination of the distances to the nearest human settlement and rainfall and its seasonality. Results from the undisturbed sites indicated that group size is positively influenced by rainfall. Our results contribute to understand why group size varies in different environments that are subjected to different ecological and human conditions. Information on these relationships is a key to advance our understanding of the socio-ecological strategies of animal species living in groups.
   Resumen La vida en grupos en ungulados ha evolucionado principalmente en especies que viven en areas abiertas, tales como sabanas y pastizales, mientras que solamente algunas especies de ungulados que viven en bosques forman grupos, y estos tienden a ser pequenos. Por esta razon, el pecari de labios blancos (Tayassu pecari), un ungulado Neotropical clasificado como Vulnerable por la UICN, representa una fenomeno social unico, ya que vive en grandes grupos cohesivos, a pesar de habitar bosques tropicales densos. Se han observado grandes variaciones en los tamanos de grupo en su distribucion, con reportes de manadas que varian de menos de 10 a mas de 300 individuos. En este estudio examinamos los factores que pueden estar causando esta variacion, incluyendo variables ecologicas y antropogenicas. Hicimos una revision exhaustiva de la literatura y usamos nuestros datos originales para compilar informacion de tamanos de grupo a lo largo de su rango. Construimos modelos estadisticos para cuantificar generalizaciones para tamanos de grupos distinguiendo datos de areas con alta presion humana (i.e. caceria) y areas que no han recibido presion humana importante en por al menos 20 anos. Encontramos que los tamanos de grupos son afectados por una combinacion de la distancia al asentamiento humano mas cercano y la cantidad de lluvia y su estacionalidad. Los resultados de los sitios con poca presion humana indican que los grupos mas grandes se encuentran en areas con mayor precipitacion. Nuestros resultados contribuyen a entender porque los tamanos de grupo varian en diferentes ambientes que estan sujetos a diferentes condiciones ecologicas y humanas. La informacion de estas relaciones es clave para avanzar en nuestro conocimiento de las estrategias socio-ecologicas de especies que viven en grupos.

AB The nutrients animals ingest are allocated to serve different functions. We used contrasting C stable isotope signatures of dominant vegetation types in a North American subtropical desert to decipher how avian consumers allocate nutrients to fuel oxidative metabolism and to construct tissues. We conducted C stable isotope analysis of breath and feathers collected from nectarivores (hummingbirds) and of breath, plasma, and red blood cell samples collected from frugivores, granivores, and insectivores. Based on varying nutrient characteristics of food sources, we expected that for frugivores and granivores, CAM-derived food (RCCAM) would have similar importance for oxidative metabolism and for tissue building, that RCCAM in nectarivores and insectivores would be more important for fueling metabolism than for generating tissues, and that (although low) RCCAM in insectivores would be higher for sustaining metabolism than for building tissues. Our predictions held true for nectarivores and granivores, but RCCAM use in tissue building was lower than expected in frugivores and higher than expected in insectivores. Our examination at the trophic guild, population, and individual levels showed that in general, nutrients used to sustain oxidative metabolism and tissue construction had a uniform isotopic origin. This finding suggests that the avian community under investigation does not route different food groups to fulfill different needs. However, we found some exceptions, indicating that birds can use different food sources for different functions, irrespective of trophic guild.
   Resumen Los animales ingieren nutrientes que luego son selectivamente dirigidos para servir diferentes funciones. Aprovechamos la existencia de diferencias en la composicion isotopica de C en los tipos de vegetacion dominantes en un desierto subtropical de Norteamerica para descifrar como los las aves asignan los nutrientes ingeridos para sustentar el metabolismo oxidativo y para construir tejidos. Realizamos analisis de isotopos estables de C de muestras de aliento y plumas recogidas de especies nectarivoras (colibries), y de aliento, plasma y globulos rojos de especies frugivoras, granivoras e insectivoras. Probamos la prediccion de que la importancia de los alimentos derivados de plantas CAM (RCCAM) en los frugivoros y granivoros fuera similar para mantener el metabolismo oxidativo y para la construccion de tejido, que RCCAM en los nectarivoros fuera muy importante para mantener el metabolismo oxidativo pero de poca importancia para generar tejidos, y que en los insectivoros la RCCAM fuera modesta pero mayor para mantener el metabolismo oxidativo que para la construccion de los tejidos. Tambien se examinaron algunas poblaciones e individuos seleccionados dentro de cada gremio. En nectarivoros, la RCCAM fue alta para el metabolismo oxidativo y baja para la produccion de plumas, en frugivoros fue intermedia para el metabolismo oxidativo y baja para construir tejidos, en granivoros fue intermedia tanto para el metabolismo oxidativo como la formacion de tejido, y en insectivoros fue baja para el metabolismo oxidativo e intermedios para la construccion de tejidos. Nuestro examen a los niveles de gremio trofico, poblacion e individuo mostraron que los nutrientes usados para sustentar el metabolismo oxidativo y la construccion de tejidos tuvieron un origen isotopico uniforme, lo que sugiere que la comunidad de aves estudiadas no se caracteriza por el enrutamiento de distintos grupos de alimentos para satisfacer diferentes necesidades. Sin embargo, encontramos algunas excepciones que indican que las aves pueden utilizar diferentes fuentes de alimentos para distintas funciones, con independencia del gremio trofico.

AB Loss and fragmentation of natural habitats are key contributors to the decline of populations and impoverishment of biological communities. The response to these disturbances can vary substantially among taxa and depends on spatial metrics of habitat fragments and the surrounding landscape. Herein we test how fragment area, shape, isolation, and matrix quality affect reptile richness, abundance, and occurrence in Brazilian Atlantic Forest fragments, a biodiversity hotspot with a poorly studied reptile fauna. We used 23 forest fragments, ranging from 2 to 30 hectares, surrounded by different matrix types, including sugarcane crop fields, cattle ranching, subsistence farmlands and rural communities. Species richness, total reptile abundance, population abundance, and occurrence probability of many species decreased with fragment area. Model selection suggested that fragment area is the main predictor of both richness and abundance, but matrix quality as well as fragment shape are also important predictors. For population abundance and occurrence probability, fragment area and proximity were the most important predictors followed by fragment shape and matrix quality, but the strength and even the sign of predictors varied substantially among species. We highlight that the value of small fragments should not be neglected for the conservation of Atlantic Forest reptiles.
   Resumo A perda e a fragmentacAo de habitats naturais sAo agentes-chave no declinio de populacoes e no empobrecimento de comunidades biologicas. A reposta a esses disturbios pode variar substancialmente entre taxons e depende de metricas espaciais dos fragmentos e da paisagem circundante. Nos testamos como a area, a forma, o isolamento e a qualidade da matriz de fragmentos da Mata Atlantica brasileira afetam a riqueza, a abundancia e a ocorrencia de repteis. Nos usamos 23 fragmentos florestais, entre 2 e 30 hectares, rodeados por matrizes comuns no cenario atual da Mata Atlantica, um dos hotspots de biodiversidade. Ao contrario das expectativas teoricas, a riqueza, a abundancia total, a abundancia populacional e a probabilidade de ocorrencia de muitas especies diminuiu com o aumento da area dos fragmentos. A selecAo de modelos sugere que a area dos fragmentos e o principal preditor tanto da riqueza quanto da abundancia das especies, mas que a qualidade da matriz, assim como a forma dos fragmentos, sAo tambem metricas importantes. Para a abundancia populacional e a probabilidade de ocorrencia das especies os preditores mais importantes foram a area e o isolamento, seguidos pela forma e qualidade da matriz dos fragmentos, mas a forca e ate mesmo o sinal do efeito mudou substancialmente entre especies. Nos destacamos que, considerando o alto grau de disturbio da paisagem, o valor de pequenos fragmentos nAo deve ser negligenciado em estrategias de conservacAo de repteis da Mata Atlantica.

AB Vegetation on sandy soils, ranging from open grasslands and shrublands to closed-canopy, thin-trunked forests, can be found in patches throughout the Amazon. Despite variation in names, appearance, ecological correlates, and suggested origins, these 'white-sand ecosystems' (WSE) share distinctive characteristics and biological communities. Here, in the first Amazon-wide review of WSE, we review the variation in WSE and the factors underlying this variation. We present the most comprehensive Amazon-wide map to date of WSE and calculate their total area. We find that WSE are still not completely mapped, and we use biological correlates as a proxy to indicate where white-sand vegetation patches likely occur. Through our synthesis of the literature, we find that key factors, such as geologic origin, soil characteristics, hydrology, and fire regimes, vary widely and have differing impacts in different regions on vegetation structure and on floral, faunal, and fungal species composition. Although studies of WSE have increased dramatically in recent years, WSE in many parts of the Amazon remain understudied, and there is little synthesis of the interaction of factors across different areas. In response, we suggest priorities for future research. Finally, we find that WSE are inadequately protected and, where accessible, are regularly mined for sand, logged, or burned and cleared for agriculture. We argue that due to their island-like distribution patterns and resultant complex metapopulation dynamics, their extremely slow recovery after disturbance, and their important contributions to basin-wide diversity patterns and ecosystem services, WSE should be given special consideration in conservation efforts to ensure their persistence in Amazonia.

AB White-sand forests represent natural laboratories of evolution over their long history throughout Amazonia and the Guiana Shield and pose significant physiological challenges to the plants and animals they host. The study of diversification in plant lineages comprising species endemic to white-sand forest can therefore give insights into processes of evolution and community assembly in tropical forests. In this article, we synthesize recent studies of white-sand forests to integrate patterns of plant species distribution with processes of lineage diversification and community assembly in the white-sand flora. We contrast lineages that have radiated uniquely in these habitats (e.g., Pagamea, Rubiaceae), with cosmopolitan lineages comprising specialists to white-sand forests and other habitats that may have arisen via ecological speciation across habitat gradients (e.g., Protium, Burseraceae). In both cases, similar suites of functional traits have evolved, including investment in dense, long-lived tissues that are well-defended structurally and chemically. White-sand endemics, therefore, play an important role in biodiversity conservation because they represent unique combinations of functional and phylogenetic diversity. Furthermore, white-sand endemics may respond differently than other tropical forest plant species to contemporary global changes because they comprise resilient functional types that may better withstand increased drought, temperature, and invasions of exotic pests in these regions.

AB Over the past three decades, many small-scale floristic studies of white-sand forests across the Amazon basin have been published. Nonetheless, a basin-wide description of both taxonomic and phylogenetic alpha and beta diversity at regional scales has never been achieved. We present a complete floristic analysis of white-sand forests across the Amazon basin including both taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity. We found strong regional differences in the signal of phylogenetic community structure with both overall and regional Net Relatedness Index and Nearest Taxon Index values found to be significantly positive leading to a pattern of phylogenetic clustering. Additionally, we found high taxonomic dissimilarity but low phylogenetic dissimilarity in pairwise community comparisons. These results suggest that recent diversification has played an important role in the assembly of white-sand forests causing geographic neo-endemism patterns at the regional scale.

AB Amazonian white-sand forests occur on quartzitic sandy soils, are distributed as an archipelago of habitat islands across the rain forests of Amazonia and contain many endemic plant species. Surprisingly, we found that only 23 percent of plant species in western Amazon white-sand forests are white-sand specialists, while the remaining species (77%) also occur in other habitat types. Overall, our analyses revealed: (1) somewhat unexpected composition similarity of white-sand forests with nearby non-white-sand forests; (2) phytogeographical connections among distant white-sand forests; and (3) a large proportion of western Amazon white-sand specialists occurring in floras of the western and central Guiana Shield region (7-43%). These results suggest that dispersal from both neighboring oligotrophic non-white-sand habitats and distant white-sand forests is fundamental in shaping western Amazonian white-sand forests' species composition and diversity. Although endemism in Amazonian white-sand forests may be lower than previously estimated, conservation of this unique and fragile environment should remain a priority. Such conservation will require the maintenance of regional dispersal processes that connect these archipelagos of habitat islands and other ecologically similar oligotrophic habitats across the Amazon and the Guiana Shield.

AB The flora of the Guiana Shield contains several plant lineages that are restricted to white-sand vegetation, some of which are widespread in tropical South America. Here, the history of diversification of one of these lineages, the genus Pagamea (Rubiaceae), is reconstructed through phylogenetic hypotheses. Data from chloroplast (rps16 and rpl20-rps12) and nuclear (ITS) markers were incongruent, with ITS found to be more consistent with morphological criteria to delimit species. Reconstruction of the ancestral area for the genus was ambiguous, with both the western Guiana Shield and the Atlantic coastal areas containing early divergent lineages, but most speciation events appeared to have happened in the western Guiana Shield where most extant diversity is present. Dispersal events into the western Amazon and the Andes (1.5-4.5 Ma) and the eastern Guiana Shield (0.4-2.2 Ma) were followed by speciation events in these regions. Dispersal events between the Amazon and Atlantic rain forest occurred at least three times independently. However, dispersals into new areas were limited, and most regions were found to be phylogenetically clustered. Altitudinal and habitat shifts happened multiple times independently, but ecological traits were found to be phylogenetically conserved, implying that such shifts were not the cause of lineage divergence. The result that most speciation events happened in the western Guiana Shield, where white-sand habitats predominate in both lowlands and highlands, and which has been less affected by Pleistocene climatic change, coupled with the result that ecological traits are phylogenetically conserved, suggests that the diversification of Pagamea may have been related primarily to the patchy distribution of white-sand vegetation.

AB Factors controlling holoepiphyte (plants which start and complete their life cycle on a phorophyte) distributions may be wide and variable. They are determined either by spatial processes, as evidenced by dispersal limitation and/or historical factors, environmental filters, such as microsite variation within phorophytes, and/or biotic interactions. Disentangling the importance of these classes is particularly difficult in tropical forests where phorophyte alpha-diversity is exceptionally high. We controlled for phorophyte specificity by studying the holoepiphytic communities of an emergent tree Aldina heterophylla (Fabaceae), known for its heavy epiphyte loads and dominance in Amazonian white-sand habitats, in order to quantify the importance of tree zone and geographic distance on holoepiphytes at fine (100 m(2)) and regional (2500 km(2) ) scales. At regional scales, tree zone explained nearly two-thirds of the main compositional gradient, accounting for more than double that of site differences. No spatial effects were observed on holoepiphyte community structure at the fine scale as treelet communities were more dissimilar than by chance alone from their neighboring emergent phorophyte. These results suggest that microsite availability, as opposed to dispersal limitation, is the most important mechanism in structuring holoepiphyte communities of this insular forest type.

AB For vegetation on white sand in Amazonia, the topography, soil nutrients, level of the water table, and rainfall combine to result in distinct formations, each with a characteristic physiognomy and each with a rather distinct floristic composition and very distinct dominants. We describe the physiognomies and present the floristic composition of nine formations, based on intensive fieldwork in NW Acre state, Brazil, where on six sites we have documented 222 species; 170 of them are woody plants or trunked palms >= 5 cm diam. Herbaceous species are good indicators for some of the formations. Distribution patterns and habitat specialization can be difficult to interpret because they often require familiarity with the localities and local terminologies involved. Many of the species show disjunct distributions congruent with the occurrence of other white-sand areas in northern South America. The nine formations within Acre are strongly dissimilar, with only two pairwise comparisons showing >50 percent similarity. Comparison of the Acre white-sand flora with datasets from Peruvian and Central + Eastern Amazonia show striking differences in composition and in taxonomic dominance, with more than 95 percent dissimilarity. White-sand formations in Acre and elsewhere are gravely affected by expanding human settlement; little is known about the regeneration and recovery of the degraded white-sand habitats. This complex sector of Acre's biological diversity is still virtually unrepresented in conservation units anywhere in Brazil's part of southwestern Amazonia, so it should be made an immediate conservation priority.

AB White-sand forests are thought to host many ectomycorrhizal fungi, as demonstrated by the numerous fruiting body collections made by Rolf Singer in the lower Rio Negro in the late 1970s. Despite recognition of the importance of ectomycorrhizal fungi in white-sand forests, there has not yet been a systematic examination of diversity and taxonomic composition across white-sand forests, or more widely across lowland Amazonian forests. In an effort to broaden our view of ectomycorrhizal fungal diversity and distribution on white-sand forests, we collected ectomycorrhizal fruiting bodies in 10 plots of white-sand forests in Brazil and French Guiana between 2012 and 2014. We collected 221 specimens and 62 morphospecies, from the 10 plots, confirming that all studied white-sand forests host ectomycorrhizal fungi. Additionally, we searched for taxa associated with white sands among specimens deposited in Brazilian herbaria. We report 1006 unique ectomycorrhizal specimen records in 18 Brazilian herbaria, of which 137 specimens and 64 species are reported from white-sand forests, mainly in the state of Amazonas, Brazil. Russulaceae and Amanitaceae were frequent in all habitats, and Cortinarius were more frequent on white sands. Our results highlight the high diversity and heterogeneity of ectomycorrhizal communities on white-sand forests, and the wide distribution of ectomycorrhizal fungi throughout Brazil, irrespective of soil type.

AB In the Amazon basin and the Guiana Shield, white-sand (WS) forests are recognized as a low-resource habitat often composed by a distinct flora with many edaphic endemic plants. Small patches of nutrient-poor white-sand forests can pose a series of challenges to plants and animals. For plants, these challenges have been shown to function as strong filters that in turn drive taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic plant composition. However, very little is known about animal communities in WS forest and the effect that low-resource availability may have on higher trophic levels. Here, we investigate the diversity of both taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity of three Lepidoptera families' (Nymphalidae, Saturniidae, and Sphingidae) assemblages between low-resource (White-Sand Forest) and two adjacent high-resource habitats, terra firme clay and seasonally flooded forests. We found no clear effect of habitat type on taxonomic composition although butterfly and moth species abundance differed among the three contrasted habitats. The WS forest Lepidoptera community is significantly more phylogenetically overdispersed than expected by chance. We suggest that these low-resource habitats filter the number of plant lineages which, in turn, creates a bottom-up control structuring Lepidoptera phylogenetic structure. We recommend long-term sampling on Lepidoptera community both at larval and adult stages that may complement this study and test hypotheses linking herbivore phylogenetic structure to plant resource availability and trophic cascade theory.

AB White-sand vegetation (WSV) harbors a unique avifauna within Amazonia, including species with patchy distributions. The history of these species' populations is likely related to variation in the availability and connectivity among WSV patches though time. By investigating the phylogeographic history of WSV bird species, we aim to better understand the dynamic evolution of forested and open habitats in Amazonia. Here, we perform a phylogeographic analysis of two WSV specialist bird species, a tanager, Tachyphonus phoenicius, and a hummingbird, Polytmus theresiae. We obtained and analyzed sequences of one mitochondrial and one nuclear gene region from 152 individuals. Results indicate that the two species have different histories. Tachyphonus phoenicius split from its Atlantic Forest/Cerrado sister clade at about 11 Ma and includes two divergent lineages, north and south of the Amazon River. Polytmus theresiae split from its Tepuian sister group at about 2.5 Ma and shows no genetic structure within Amazonia. Both lineages of T. phoenicius and P. theresiae show signs of recent population expansion. Although the two WSV species originated at different moments, and show distinct patterns of population structure, both seem to have expanded their population sizes recently, indicating that availability of white-sand habitats may have been increasing historically and the connectivity among different white-sand patches may have been higher in the recent past.

AB Vegetation growing on white-sand soils is patchily distributed across the Amazon and is characterized by scrublands or open vegetation types (white-sand campinas) and by forests (white-sand forests) surrounded by contrasting habitat types. We studied birds in patches of white-sand campinas in contrasting landscapes in four regions located in distinct biogeographic units delimited by major rivers. Our aim was to investigate the contribution of landscape configuration and biogeographic context to patterns of species diversity and distribution. Araca and Virua landscapes (on opposite sides of Rio Branco) are composed by large and continuous patches of white-sand campinas, while Jau, Novo Airao and Uatuma landscapes (on opposite sides of Rio Negro) are composed by small patches of white-sand campinas isolated by continuous terra firme forests. Birds were sampled using mist-nets and qualitative censuses, and were classified as white-sand vegetation specialists or non-specialists. Bird species diversity was significantly different among studied regions, and composition was significantly different for both, specialists and non-specialists birds. Local variability in species diversity and composition was best explained by white-sand campina area, patch proximity, and distance to major rivers. We conclude that landscape configuration and biogeographical context influence patterns of bird diversity, abundance, and composition in Amazonian white-sand campinas.

We observed higher than expected CO2 effluxes at the place of measurement under intermediate sap flux velocities and lower fluxes under high sap flux velocity. This variation disappeared after removing the tree crown.

TI How Do Fruit Bat Seed Shadows Benefit Agroforestry? Insights from Local

AB Old-world fruit bats are known to provide significant benefits to tropical agroforestry through seed dispersal services. However, the social pathways through which local people perceive and actually utilize these benefits are not well understood. Through interview surveys with plantation owners and farmers in the Western Ghats of Kerala (India), we documented local perceptions and knowledge about the socio-ecological importance of fruit bat seed dispersal shadows. Respondents' perceptions were highly positive, with greater benefits reported from seed dispersal, than costs from fruit damage by bats. Interestingly, seed aggregation of commercial fruit crops (cashew, areca) by fruit bats was perceived to reduce agricultural labour costs in plantations. Our study demonstrates that local perceptions can offer valuable insights toward understanding the contribution of bat-generated ecosystem services for tropical agroforestry systems, and in turn may facilitate effective fruit bat conservation.

AB Environmental characteristics have a major effect on the species composition of seasonally dry tropical forest. However, this effect has been little considered when describing secondary succession of this ecosystem. We tested the hypothesis that local environmental heterogeneity influences successional trajectories when high species richness is available. Changes in species composition and structure were described in 126 vegetation plots differing in successional stage and located along a topographical and soil nutrient gradient. Variation in community composition was partitioned between successional stage, environmental characteristics, and spatial structure using redundancy analyses. In addition, relationships between plot distance matrices for these factors were analysed by means of Mantel tests. High species turnover was observed during succession and species composition similarity was higher among late successional forest than among early and intermediate forests. A higher portion of variation in species composition was explained by environmental characteristics compared to successional stage, whereas the spatial structure of the data was weak. Our results suggest that in the region of study, variation in the successional trajectories is occurring owing to environmental heterogeneity, as well as to human disturbance and other unmeasured processes.

AB Lianas (woody vines) can have profound effects on tree recruitment, growth, survival, and diversity in tropical forests. However, the dynamics of liana colonization soon after land abandonment are poorly understood, and thus it is unknown whether lianas alter tree regeneration early in succession. We examined the liana community in 43 forests that ranged from 1 to 31yr old in central Panama to determine how fast lianas colonize young forests and how the liana community changes with forest succession. We found that lianas reached high densities early in succession, commonly exceeding 1000 stems/ha within the first 5yr of forest regeneration. Lianas also increased rapidly during early succession in terms of basal area but did not show evidence of saturation within the 30yr of our chronosequence. The relative contribution of lianas to total woody plant community in terms of basal area and density increased rapidly and reached a saturation point within 5yr (basal area) to 15yr (density) after land abandonment. Our data demonstrate that lianas recruit early and in high density in tropical forest regeneration, and thus lianas may have a large effect on the way in which secondary forests develop both early and throughout succession.

AB Light is of primary importance in structuring tropical tree communities. Light exposure at seedling and adult stages has been used to characterize the ecological profile of tropical trees, with many implications in forest management and restoration ecology. Most shade-tolerance classification systems have been proposed based on empirical observations in a specific area and thus result in contradictions among categories assigned to a given species. In this study, we aimed to quantify the light requirements for seedling growth of a Central African timber tree, Lophira alata (Ochnaceae), taking into account effects of population origin. In two controlled experiments: a light response experiment and a comparative population experiment, conducted in southwestern Cameroon, using seeds collected from four populations (three from Cameroon and one from Gabon), we examined the quantitative responses to irradiance of seedlings. After 2years, mortality was very low (<3%), even in extremely low irradiance. Growth and biomass allocation patterns varied in response to light, with intermediate irradiance (24-43%) providing optimal conditions. Light response differed between populations. The Boumba population in the northeastern edge of the species' distribution exhibited the highest light requirements, suggesting a local adaptation. As a result of positive growth at low irradiance and maximum growth at intermediate irradiance, we concluded that L. alata exhibits characteristics of both non-pioneer and pioneer species. Implications of our results to propose an objective way to assign the light requirement for tropical tree species are discussed.

AB The elucidation of phytogeographic patterns and their drivers in biodiversity hotspots is essential to the study of ecology and the conservation of these areas. In 2000, an important study by Oliveira-Filho and Fontes led to changes in the paradigms that define our understanding of the Atlantic Forest (Brazil). Here, our aim was to revisit this study using a more comprehensive set of environmental predictors, an updated and much larger tree species dataset and checklist, and more refined data analyses. We performed exploratory and confirmatory analyses, including the modeling of the spatial components with Moran's Eigenvector Maps, using data from 483 sites in southeastern Brazil, which encompass a total of 3546 species and 33 geo-climatic variables. We observed strong floristic similarities between rain- and seasonal forests and a species distribution continuum across the main gradients. The environmental and spatial variables were significantly correlated with floristic patterns, and we demonstrated that the tree flora of the seasonal forests should no longer be considered a simple subset of the rain forest flora. The findings of the original paper were not only confirmed but we also unveiled additional, important phytogeographic patterns. We also reinforced the main conclusion of the paper that the Atlantic Forest concept must encompass all of the forest types east of the dry corridor in South America, a designation of utmost importance for the conservation of this biodiversity hotspot.

AB The multi-scale spatial match between bird and food abundances is a main driver of the structure of fruit-eating bird assemblages. We explored how the activity of fruit-eating birds was influenced by the abundance of fruits at the local and landscape scales in Andean mountain forests during the breeding season, when most birds forage close to their nest. We measured: (1) the spatial scale of variation in the abundance of fruits, (2) the spatial scale of variation in the activity of fruit-eating birds, and (3) the spatial match between both variables. The sampling design consisted of eleven 1.2-ha sites, each subdivided into 30 cells of 20x20m, where we sampled fruits and fruit-eating birds. We found that fruit consumption, and to a lesser extent bird abundance, were associated with local spatial variation in abundance of selected fruit species. However, fruit-eating birds did not modify their spatial distribution in the landscape following changes in availability of these fruits. Our study shows that fruit-eating birds detect local spatial variation in fruit availability in their home breeding ranges, and exploit patches with large clusters of selected fruits. However, it may be unprofitable for breeding birds to stray too far from their nests to exploit fruit-rich patches, accounting for the absence of fruit tracking at larger spatial scales.

AB The distribution, diversity, and assembly of tropical insects have long intrigued ecologists, and for tropical ants, can be affected by competitive interactions, microhabitat requirements, dispersal, and availability and diversity of nesting sites. Arboreal twig-nesting ants are limited by the number of hollow twigs available, especially in intensive agricultural systems. Ant diversity and abundance may shift along elevation gradients, but no studies have examined if the proportion of occupied twigs or richness of arboreal twig-nesting ants vary with elevation. In coffee agroecosystems, there are over 40 species of arboreal twig-nesting ants. We examined communities of twig-nesting ants in coffee plants along an elevational gradient to answer the following questions: (1) Do species richness and colony abundance decline with elevation or show a mid-elevation peak? (2) Does community composition change with elevation? (3) Is elevation an important predictor of change in ant abundance, richness, and relative abundance of common species? We surveyed 42 10x10m plots in 2013 from 450 to1550m elevation across a coffee landscape in Chiapas, Mexico. We sampled a total of 2211 hollow coffee twigs, 77.1percent of which were occupied by one of 28 species of ants. Pseudomyrmexsimplex was more abundant in lower elevations, whereas Pseudomyrmexejectus dominated in high elevations. Species richness and the percent of occupied hollow twigs both peaked at mid-elevations (800-1050m). In sum, we found that species richness, abundance, and composition of arboreal twig-nesting ants shift with elevation. These findings may provide important insights for understanding ant communities in coffee agroecosystems.

AB Primary tropical rain forests are being rapidly perforated with new edges via roads, logging, and pastures, and vast areas of secondary forest accumulate following abandonment of agricultural lands. To determine how insectivorous Amazonian understory birds respond to edges between primary rain forest and three age classes of secondary forest, we radio-tracked two woodcreepers (Glyphorynchus spirurus, N=17; Xiphorhynchus pardalotus, N=18) and a terrestrial antthrush (Formicarius colma, N=19). We modeled species-specific response to distance to forest edge (a continuous variable) based on observations at varying distances from the primary-secondary forest interface. All species avoided 8-14-yr-old secondary forest. Glyphorynchus spirurus and F.colma mostly remained within primary forest <100m from the young edge. Young F.colma rarely penetrated >100m into secondary forest 27-31yr old. Young Formicarius colma and most G.spirurus showed a unimodal response to 8-14-yr-old secondary forest, with relative activity concentrated just inside primary forest. After land abandonment, G.spirurus was the first to recover to the point where there was no detectable edge response (after 11-14yr), whereas X.pardalotus was intermediate (15-20yr), and F. colma last (28-30yr +). Given the relatively quick recovery by our woodcreeper species, new legislation on protection of secondary forests >20-yr old in Brazil's Para state may represent a new opportunity for conservation and management; however, secondary forest must mature to at least 30yr before the full compliment of rain forest-dependent species can use secondary forest without adverse edge effects.

AB Human food supplementation can affect components of animal socioecology by altering the abundance and distribution of available food. We studied the effect of food supplementation by comparing the ranging patterns and intergroup interactions of two groups of northern pigtailed macaques (Macaca leonina), a non-territorial primate species. One group was partially reliant on food provisioning, whereas the other group foraged wild food. We also compared the macaques' movement with that of a group of white-handed gibbons (Hylobates lar), a territorial species inhabiting the same site. Home range, core area, and daily path lengths were significantly smaller for the semi-provisioned group than for the wild-feeding group. In contrast to wild-feeding macaques, supplemented macaques showed higher fidelity to home range, core area, and particularly to the region where human food was most accessible and abundant. The relationship of daily path length and home range indicated a low defendability index for wild-feeding macaques; the higher index for the semi-provisioned group was consistent with the territorial pattern found in gibbons. Semi-provisioned macaques showed further traits of territoriality with aggression during intergroup encounters. These findings indicate that human modification of food availability can significantly affect movement patterns and intergroup competition in macaques. The observed ranging dynamics related to food provisioning may decrease the efficiency of macaques as seed dispersers and increase predation on their home range, and thus have important consequences for plant regeneration and animal diversity.

AB Tropical rain forest understory insectivorous birds are declining, even in large forest reserves, yet the mechanisms remain unclear. Abundant large mammals can reshape forest structure, which degrades foraging microhabitat. We used six sites in Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Panama with varying collared peccary (Pecari tajacu) density to test three linked hypotheses: (1) locally declining understory insectivores forage preferentially in liana tangles; (2) vine and liana density, cover, and frequency of dense tangles are lower in the presence of abundant collared peccaries; and consequently (3) abundant collared peccaries are associated with reduced understory insectivorous bird abundance. Three insectivores that declined at La Selva preferentially foraged in liana tangles: Checker-throated Antwren (Epinecrophylla fulviventris), Dot-winged Antwren (Microrhopias quixensis), and Ruddy-tailed Flycatcher (Terenotriccus erythrurus). Vine density, liana cover, liana tangle frequency, and forest cover were lower in the presence of collared peccaries relative to experimental mammal exclosures, with the greatest differences at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. Across sites, five of seven vine and liana measures showed negative, curvilinear relationships with peccary densities. Vine and liana measures peaked at sites with intermediate peccary density, and were low at La Selva. Structural equation models suggest negative indirect effects of the collared peccaries on focal bird densities, mediated by vine and liana density, cover, or tangle frequency. Forest area and rainfall affected both lianas and birds, but collared peccaries also contributed to the reduced abundance of understory insectivores. Indirect effects such as that suggested here may occur even in large, protected forest reserves where large mammal communities are changing.

AB Nest predation is assumed to be an important factor driving avian life histories. Altitudinal gradients offer valuable study systems to investigate how avian nest predation risk varies between bird populations. In this study, a hypothesis postulating an increase in avian nest survival rate with elevation as a result of decreasing predation pressure was experimentally tested along an altitudinal gradient (300-2250m) in West-Central Africa. Three types of artificial nests (cup-shrub, cup-ground and bare-ground) were used along the altitudinal gradient. Overall, elevation had no effect on the daily survival rate (DSR) of the artificial nests. However, there was a significant elevation-nest type interaction. Daily survival rate for cup-shrub nests decreased significantly with elevation, but for cup-ground and bare-ground nests, elevation had no significant effect. We tested the effects of the same vegetation parameters (tree density, herb and shrub layer coverage, and canopy openness) on the DSR of different nest types to understand how different vegetation layers or combinations of them affect DSR. Daily survival rate for bare-ground nests significantly decreased with increasing canopy openness, and was positively influenced by coverage of herb layer and tree density. For cup-shrub nests, DSR increased significantly with increasing shrub layer coverage. Finally, for cup-ground nests, we found a positive effect of shrub coverage and canopy openness on DSR. In summary, we found that different forest vegetation layers affect predation risk of different nest types along elevations on Mt. Cameroon.

AB Despite the high proportion of secondary forests in the tropics, their conservation value remains poorly understood, particularly with regard to animals. Most theoretical studies of succession have focused on plants, linking life history trade-offs to well-known patterns of community change. However, the same trade-offs proposed for plants should apply to animals, and indeed, animal studies show a change in community dominance from habitat generalist to forest specialist species during succession. Focusing on the diverse terrestrial small mammals of the endangered Atlantic Forest, we assessed which ecological drivers (habitat structure and food availability) affect community changes during succession. If the change in community dominance is driven by trade-offs between productivity and efficiency, it should be mainly associated with a decrease in food availability. As expected, from younger to older forest, habitat generalists decreased in richness and total abundance, concurrent with a decrease in arthropod biomass. By contrast, the increase in richness and total abundance of forest specialists was not clearly supported by the data; however, this group was not affected by food availability. These results are congruent with a trade-off between competitive ability and ability to use abundant resources, and indicate that the major community change during succession involves habitat generalists. Secondary forests may thus be valuable for conservation, at least where habitat loss and fragmentation are not high, and old growth forest is available.

AB We aimed to determine the role of soil nutrients in the herbaceous-tree boundary in a tropical mangrove forest. We assembled plots in this boundary such that each was initially covered by similar to 50% of each life form. We added NPK to three of the plots monthly and monitored them, along with the control plots, for 18mo. In plots with added NPK, mangrove branches grew over and shaded the herbaceous plants, resulting in the presence of mostly bare soil. The mangrove trees eventually covered similar to 80% of the experimental plots, but the proportion of cover in the control plots remained unaltered. We conclude that soil nutrient level modulates the mangrove-herbaceous plant interaction in steps, and from a given level there is a shift in the dominant life form. This mechanism leads to a sharp transition over a smooth nutritional gradient.
   Resumo As condicoes ambientais sAo geralmente consideradas os principais fatores a limitar a distribuicAo de especies de mangue. Elas podem agir diretamente, por exemplo, restringido a ocorrencia das especies, ou indiretamente modulando a interacAo entre elas. Em estuarios tropicais a fronteira entre o manguezal e as herbaceas e usualmente muito marcada, embora ocorra sobre um gradiente relativamente suave. Enquanto existem alguns estudos sobre a fronteira entre duas formacoes de herbaceas em estuarios temperados, os mecanismos que regem as fronteiras entre arvores e herbaceas em estuarios tropicais sAo desconhecidos. Nosso objetivo e determinar o papel dos nutrientes do solo na fronteira manguezal-herbaceas atraves de um experimento onde manipulamos a fertilidade do solo. Nos estabelecemos parcelas nessa fronteira de forma que inicialmente cada forma de vida ocupasse 50% da parcela. Em tres das parcelas adicionamos mensalmente NPK. As outras tres foram o controle. Acompanhamos as parcelas por 18 meses. Quando NPK foi adicionado, os galhos do mangue cresceram mais e sombrearam as herbaceas. Isso resultou em um solo predominantemente exposto sob os galhos do manguezal. Com o tempo o manguezal chegou a cobrir similar to 80% da area das parcelas. Concluimos que o nivel nutricional do solo e um fator importante na modulacAo da interacAo mangue-herbaceas, e que a partir de certa quantidade de nutrientes acontece uma alteracAo na forma de vida dominante. Esse mecanismo leva a uma transicAo abrupta sobre um gradiente nutricional suave.

AB Rodents are known to perform post-dispersal seed predation in tropical rain forest, but there is little information on the identity of these seed predators and how they select their seeds. Using cafeteria experiments, we found that seed mass, rodent body mass, and the ratio of seed/rodent mass were determinants of seed consumption.

AB Studies have shown that median distances of plants from the nearest reproductive conspecific (recruitment distance) shifts outward with increasing age or size class, and that plant spatial distribution changes over time in a predictable manner. However, observations and empirical evidence for such predictable changes are limited, and underlying mechanisms explaining such patterns for a wide range of individual sizes are not fully explored. In Costa Rican premontane wet forests, I empirically tested whether recruitment distance changes in a predictable manner with increasing size for five animal-dispersed tree species by considering all post-germination sizes. Specifically, I tested the Janzen-Connell hypothesis and the colonization hypothesis by considering distance, density, size, herbivory, biotic infection, and light availability simultaneously. Recruitment distance increased with increasing size (16-22m) for the four non-pioneer species, suggesting eventual regeneration success for seeds dispersed away from reproductive conspecifics. During the 2years of this study, I found positive distance-dependent survivorship and light availability were important for post-seedling survivorship, in agreement with the Janzen-Connell hypothesis and the colonization hypothesis, respectively, but only for seedlings. However, seedlings did not escape aboveground herbivory or biotic infection better when the seeds were dispersed greater distances. Results highlight the importance of seed dispersal for successful regeneration, and suggest that changes in spatial distribution over time may be predictable in the vicinity of maternal trees for some non-pioneer tree species.
   Resumen Estudios han demostrado que la distancia media de los individuos a su mas cercano conspecifico reproductor (distancia de reclutamiento) se amplia con el aumento de la edad o clase de tamano, y que la distribucion espacial de las plantas puede cambiar con el tiempo de una manera predecible. Sin embargo, las observaciones y datos empiricos para tales los cambios previsibles son limitadas, y los mecanismos subyacentes que explican estos patrones para una amplia gama de tamanos individuales no son completamente explorado. En bosques humedos premonranos en Costa Rica, probe empiricamente si la distancia de reclutamiento cambia de una forma predecible con el aumento del tamano de cinco especies de arboles, dispersadas por animales, considerando todos los tamanos posteriores a la germinacion. En concreto, me demostrar la hipotesis Janzen-Connell y la hipotesis de colonizacion, considerando distancia, densidad, tamano, herbivoros, infeccion biotica, y disponibilidad de luz al mismo tiempo. La distancia de reclutamiento aumento con el aumento del tamano de (16-22m) cuatro de las especies no pioneras, lo que sugiere un eventual exito de las semillas dispersadas lejos de sus conspecificos reproductivos. Durante los dos anos de este estudio, he encontrado supervivencia dependiente positivamente de la distancia y la disponibilidad de luz fueron importantes para la sobrevivencia posterior a la germinacion, de acuerdo con la hipotesis Janzen-Connell, pero solo para plantulas. Sin embargo, las plantulas no se escaparon mejor de la herbivoria o la infeccion biotica cuando se las semillas se dispersaron a mayor distancia. Resultados aqui resaltan la importancia de la dispersion de semillas para una regeneracion exitosa, y sugieren que cambios en la distribucion espacial en el tiempo puede ser predecible en las cercanias los arboles maternales para algunas especies de arboles no pioneras.

AB Hurricane-caused tree mortality in tropical dry forests occurs predominantly in early successional species. Consequently, hurricanes may accelerate succession in these forests. Forest regeneration, however, must be measured over an extended posthurricane time period to demonstrate this pattern. In this study, we recorded tree seedlings in 19 Florida Keys forests during May-August 1995, 3years after Hurricane Andrew. For these forestsspanning a chronosequence from 14 to over 100years since the most recent clearingwe used weighted averaging regression on relative abundances of pre-hurricane trees to calculate a successional age optimum for each species; and used weighted averaging calibration to calculate inferred successional ages for stands based on pre-hurricane trees and on posthurricane seedlings. To test the hypothesis that successional stage of seedlings exceeded successional stage of pre-hurricane trees, we compared inferred stand ages based on posthurricane seedlings with those based on pre-hurricane trees. Across the study area, inferred stand ages based on posthurricane seedlings were greater than those based on pre-hurricane trees (P<0.005); however, more seedlings in the youngest stands were early successional than in older stands. Of 29 species present both as pre-hurricane trees and posthurricane seedlings, 23 had animal-dispersed seeds. These results provide evidence that: (1) hurricanes do not reset' succession, and may accelerate succession; and (2) a strong legacy of stand successional age influences seedling assemblages in these forests.

AB The ecology of many tropical rain forest organisms, not the least in Africa, remains poorly understood. Here, we present a detailed ecological study of epiphytic lichens in the equatorial montane rain forest of Bwindi National Park (331km(2)), Uganda. We evaluated all major lichen growth forms, including selected groups of crustose lichens. In 14 transects at elevations of 1290m to 2500m, we sampled 276 trees belonging to 60 species. We recorded all lichen species on each tree trunk between ground level and 2m above the ground, yielding 191 lichen species in 67 genera, with a mean of 4.7 species per tree. We used non-metric multi-dimensional scaling to separate epiphytic lichen assemblages according to tree species composition and elevation. Structural equation modeling indicated that elevation influenced tree species composition and that tree species composition largely determined lichen species composition. Thus, elevation acted indirectly on the lichen assemblages. Further studies examining factors such as bark properties and lichen colonization ecology may clarify what determines the association between tree species and lichen assemblages. The link between lichen assemblages and large-scale elevation patterns, as well as disturbance and regrowth histories, warrants further study. An analysis of lichen species composition on individual tree species that occur over large elevation ranges would distinguish the effect of tree species on lichen assemblages from the effect of elevation and thus climate. Our study highlights the limited extent of our knowledge of tropical epiphytic lichens.

AB Various techniques have been used to estimate the age of Brazil nut trees (Bertholletia excelsa Bonpl.), but these techniques produce large discrepancies. Here, we first verified that two individuals of known ages from a plantation in central Amazonia, Brazil, have a congruent number of growth rings. The indexed average tree-ring curve was significantly correlated with total precipitation during the rainy season (November-June) over a 50-yr period, confirming the annual nature of the tree rings. Second, we analyzed Brazil nut trees from two populations in the Trombetas (eastern Amazon) and Purus (central Amazon) regions, performing tree-ring analysis to estimate tree age and diameter increment rates. We compared age-diameter relationships, mean passage time through 10-cm diameter size classes, and growth trajectories of individual trees. The maximum age of Brazil nut trees analyzed was 361yr in the Purus and 401yr in the Trombetas. Trees at the Purus site had higher mean diameter increment rates and showed more variation compared to trees at the Trombetas site. Individual growth trajectories show that the majority of trees attained the canopy by direct growth, while a smaller number passed through one release or one suppression event before becoming established in the canopy. None of the trees passed through multiple release and suppression events. The age estimations presented here are comparable to previous tree-ring analyses for the species, and the observed growth patterns support earlier work indicating B.excelsa as a gap-dependent tree species.
   Resumo Varias tecnicas vem sido utilizadas para se estimar a idade de Castanheiras-do-Para (Bertholletia excelsa Bonpl.). Entretanto, diferentes metodos apresentaram grande discrepancias em relacAo as estimativas das idades. No presente estudo, primeiramente verificamos um numero congruente de aneis de crescimento de dois individuos com idades conhecidas pertencentes a uma plantacAo na Amazonia Central, Brasil. A curva media indexada dos aneis de crescimento apresentou uma relacAo significativa com a precipitacAo total durante a estacAo chuvosa (novembro a junho) ao longo de um periodo de 50 anos, confirmando a natureza anual dos aneis das arvores. Posteriormente, analisamos os aneis de crescimento a fim de estimar a idade das arvores da Castanheiras-do-Para e as taxas de incremento de madeira em duas populacoes: uma na regiAo do rio Trombetas (Amazonia Oriental) e outra no rio Purus (Amazonia Central). Nestes dois locais, avaliamos as relacoes entre idade e diametro, o tempo medio para avancarem pelas classes de tamanho de 10cm de diametro e as trajetorias de crescimento individual das arvores. A idade maxima das Castanheiras-do-Para analisadas foi de 361 anos no Purus, e de 401 anos no Trombetas. As taxas de incremento diametrico medio foram altas e mais variaveis no Purus do que no Trombetas. As trajetorias de crescimento individual mostraram que a maioria das arvores atingiu o dossel por crescimento direto, enquanto um numero menor passou por um evento de liberacAo ou supressAo antes de se estabelecer no dossel. Nenhuma das arvores passou por eventos multiplos de liberacAo ou supressAo. As estimativas de idade apresentadas aqui sAo comparaveis as analises anteriores de aneis de crescimento para a especie e os padroes de crescimento observados corroboram estudos anteriores indicando que a Castanheira-do-Para e uma especie arborea dependente de clareiras.

AB With growing pressure on primary forests from destructive land uses, increasing the diversity of native species plantations can increase ecosystem service provision, such as timber production or carbon sequestration, thus better supporting sustainable livelihoods. Understanding the effects of tree species composition on productivity can inform plantation design and ecological restoration strategies. However, tree species composition effects have been neglected in experimental biodiversity-ecosystem function (BEF) research. This study uses a 10-yr data set from one of the first tropical planted forest experiments established with native species and designed for BEF research at scales relevant to forest management. At our site in Sardinilla, Panama, we established plots containing 6 species from a pool of 18, in four combinations, to investigate how composition affects species and plot productivity. We used basal area as a proxy for productivity through time, measured annually, and summed this at species and plot levels for analysis. We found that plots that differed in species composition appeared to differ in temporal rate of basal area increase, but did not differ in BA after 10yr. Species were generally consistent in size between compositions, and composition performance was correlated with the size of component species, suggesting that species identities were most important in determining plot productivity. Our results suggest that species choice can be based on preferences for individual species, as species performance was consistent across composition contexts. We make recommendations for the use of particularly productive species that also provide multiple services such as Guazuma ulmifolia, Spondias mombin, and Anacardium excelsum.
   Resumen Con la presion cada vez mayor sobre los bosques primarios proveniente de utilizaciones del suelo destructivas, el aumento de la diversidad de plantaciones de especies nativas puede aumentar la prestacion de servicios de los ecosistemas, tales como la produccion de madera o la captura de carbono, y por lo tanto, aumentar el apoyo a medios de vida sostenibles. La comprension de los efectos de la composicion de las especies de arboles en la productividad, puede informar sobre el diseno de plantacion y las estrategias de restauracion ecologica. Sin embargo, los efectos de la composicion de especies de arboles se han descuidado en las investigaciones de funcion experimental de la biodiversidad en los ecosistemas o BEF por sus siglas en ingles. Este estudio utiliza un conjunto de datos de 10 anos de uno de los primeros experimentos establecido en bosques tropicales con especies nativas y disenado para la investigacion BEF a escalas relevantes para la gestion forestal. En nuestro sitio en Sardinilla, Panama, establecimos parcelas que contienen seis especies de un grupo de dieciocho anos, en cuatro combinaciones, para investigar como la composicion afecta las especies y la productividad en las parcelas. Utilizamos el area basal como proxy de la productividad a traves del tiempo, medido anualmente, y esto lo sumamos al nivel de las especies y las parcelas para el analisis. Se encontro que las parcelas que diferian en la composicion de especies parecian diferir en la tasa de incremento temporal de la zona basal pero no difirieron en el area basal despues de 10 anos. Las especies fueron generalmente consistentes en tamano entre las composiciones, y el rendimiento de la composicion se correlaciono con el tamano de las especies que lo componen, lo que sugiere que la identidad de las especies fue mas importante para determinar la productividad en la parcela. Nuestros resultados sugieren que la eleccion de las especies puede estar basada en las preferencias por las distintas especies, ya que el rendimiento de especies fue consistente en contextos de composicion. Hacemos recomendaciones para el uso de especies particularmente productivas que tambien ofrecen multiples servicios como Guazuma ulmifolia, Spondias mombin y Anacardium excelsum.

AB Temperature, food quantity and quality play important roles in insect growth and survival, influencing population dynamics as well as interactions with other community members. However, the interaction between temperature and diet and its ecological consequences have been poorly documented. Toxorhynchites are well-known biocontrol agents for container-inhabiting mosquito larvae. We found that Toxorhynchites haemorrhoidalis larvae (Diptera: Culicidae) inhabiting water-filled rosettes of tank bromeliads catch and eat prey of both aquatic (mosquito larvae) and terrestrial origin (ants), using distinct predatory methods. They carried out frontal attacks on ants, but ambushed mosquito larvae. In choice tests, T.haemorrhoidalis favored terrestrial prey. Temperature had a significant effect on predator development and survival through its interaction with diet, but did not alter the preference for ants. T.haemorrhoidalis larvae emerged quickly when fed only mosquito larvae, whereas all individuals died before pupation when fed only ants. We conclude that behavioral factors (i.e., attraction to ants that disturb the surface of the water) overtake physiological factors (i.e., the adverse outcome of elevated temperature and an ant-based diet) in determining a predator's response to temperature:diet interactions. Finally, because T.haemorrhoidalis larvae preferentially feed on terrestrial insects in tank bromeliads, mosquito larvae may indirectly benefit from predation release.
   Resume La temperature et la quantite/qualite de la ressource alimentaire jouent un role important dans le developpement et la survie des insectes, ce qui influence la dynamique des populations ainsi que les interactions au sein des communautes. Cependant les consequences ecologiques des effets combines de la temperature et du regime alimentaire ont ete faiblement documentees. Les culicides du genre Toxorhynchites sont des agents de lutte biologique bien connus contre les larves de moustiques. Les larves de Toxorhynchites haemorrhoidalis (Diptere: Culicidae) vivant dans les bromeliacees a reservoirs peuvent se nourrir de proies aquatiques (larves de moustiques) et terrestres (fourmis). Nos tests de choix demontrent que T. haemorrhoidalis selectionne preferentiellement les fourmis selon un comportement de predation active, contre un comportement d'embuscade envers les moustiques. L'effet de la temperature sur le developpement et la survie des larves predatrices varie significativement selon le regime alimentaire mais n'affecte pas la preference pour les fourmis. Lorsqu'elles sont nourries avec des larves de moustiques, les larves de T. haemorrhoidalis emergent rapidement alors qu'elles meurent avant la pupaison si elles se nourrissent seulement de fourmis. En conclusion, les facteurs comportementaux (detectabilite des fourmis) dominent les facteurs physiologiques (consequences negatives de fortes temperatures et d'un regime constitue que de fourmis) dans la reponse des predateurs vis-a-vis de l'interaction entre la temperature et le regime alimentaire. Finalement, nous suggerons que la preference pour les proies terrestres par T. haemorrhoidalis beneficierait aux autres larves moustiques a travers un relachement de la pression de predation.

AB Despite potential interactive effects of plant species and genotypic diversity (SD and GD, respectively) on consumers, studies have usually examined these effects separately. We evaluated the individual and combined effects of tree SD and mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla) GD on the arthropod community associated with mahogany. We conducted this study within the context of a tree diversity experiment consisting of 74 plots with 64 saplings/plot. We sampled 24 of these plots, classified as monocultures of mahogany or polycultures of four species (including mahogany). Within each plot type, mahogany was represented by either one or four maternal families. We surveyed arthropods on mahogany and estimated total arthropod abundance and species richness, as well as abundance and richness separately for herbivorous and predatory arthropods. Overall tree SD and mahogany GD had positive effects on total arthropod species richness and abundance on mahogany, and also exerted interactive effects on total species richness (but not abundance). Analyses conducted by trophic level group showed contrasting patterns; SD positively influenced herbivore species richness but not abundance, and did not affect either predator richness or abundance. GD influenced predator species richness but not abundance, and did not influence herbivore abundance or richness. There were interactive effects of GD and SD only for predator species richness. These results provide evidence that intra- and inter-specific plant diversity exert interactive controls on associated consumer communities, and that the relative importance of SD and GD may vary among higher trophic levels, presumably due to differences in the underlying mechanisms or consumer traits.
   Resumen A pesar del potencial de efectos de interaccion entre la diversidad de especies y la diversidad genotipica (DS y DG respectivamente) sobre los consumidores, en general dichos efectos han sido evaluados de manera aislada. Evaluamos los efectos individuales y combinados de la DS de arboles y de la DG de la caoba (Swietenia microphylla) sobre la comunidad de artropodos asociados a la caoba. Llevamos a cabo este estudio en el contexto de un experimento de diversidad de arboles consistente en 74 parcelas con 64 arboles juveniles/parcela. Muestreamos 24 parcelas clasificadas como monocultivos de caoba o policultivos de cuatro especies (incluida la caoba). Dentro de cada tipo de parcela, la caoba estuvo representada por una o cuatro familias maternas. Se colectaron los artropodos asociados a la caoba y estimamos la abundancia y riqueza de especies, asi como de manera separada la abundancia y riqueza de artropodos herbivoros y artropodos depredadores. En general la DS de arboles y la DG de caoba tuvieron efectos positivos sobre la riqueza y abundancia total de artropodos y tambien ejercieron un efecto de interaccion sobre la riqueza total (pero no sobre la abundancia). El analisis separado por gremio trofico mostro patrones contrastantes; la DS influyo positivamente en la riqueza de herbivoros pero no en la abundancia y no afecto la riqueza o abundancia de los depredadores. Por su parte la DG afecto la riqueza de especies de los depredadores pero no su abundancia y no afecto la riqueza o abundancia de los herbivoros. Se observaron efectos de interaccion entre la DS y la DG solo para la riqueza de especies de depredadores. Nuestros resultados proveen evidencias de que la diversidad intra e inter-especifica de plantas ejercen un control interactivo sobre las comunidades de consumidores, y que la importancia relativa de la DS y la DG puede variar entre niveles troficos superiores, presumiblemente debido a diferencias en mecanismos subyacentes o por rasgos de los consumidores.

AB Documenting how diversity patterns vary at fine- and broad scales may help answer many questions in theoretical and applied ecology. However, studies tend to compare diversity patterns at the same scale and within the same taxonomic group, which limits the applicability and generality of the results. Here, we have investigated whether vegetation-dwelling arthropods from different trophic ranks and with distinct life histories (i.e., ants, caterpillars, cockroaches, and spiders) have different beta-diversity patterns at multiple scales. Specifically, we compared their beta diversity across architecturally distinct plant species (fine-scale process) and a latitudinal gradient of sites (broad-scale process) along 2040km of coastal restinga vegetation in the Neotropics. Over 50 percent of the compositional changes (-diversity) in ants, caterpillars, and spiders and 41 percent of those in cockroaches were explained by plant identity within each site. Even groups that do not feed on plant tissues, such as omnivores and predators, were strongly affected by plant identity. Fine-scale variation was more important than large-scale processes for all studied groups. Performing a cross-scale comparison of diversity patterns of groups with distinct life histories helps elucidate how processes that act at regional scales, such as dispersal, interact with local processes to assemble arthropod communities.
   Resumo Entender como os padroes de diversidade variam em escalas finas e amplas pode responder muitas questoes em ecologia aplicada e teorica. Porem, muitos estudos comparam padroes de diversidade na mesma escala e dentro do mesmo grupo taxonomico, o que limita a aplicabilidade e generalizacAo dos resultados. Nos investigamos se multiplos artropodes que vivem na vegetacAo e que pertencem a diferentes ordens troficas e com historia de vida distinta (i.e., aranhas, baratas, formigas, e lagartas) apresentam padroes de diversidade beta diferentes em multiplas escalas. Especificamente, comparamos a diversidade beta entre especies de plantas com arquiteturas distintas (um processo de escala fina) e localidades diferentes ao longo do gradiente latitudinal (um processo de escala ampla) ao longo de 2.040km em vegetacAo costeira de restinga na regiAo Neotropical. Observamos que mais de 50% das mudancas na composicAo de especies (diversidade beta) de formigas, lagartas e aranhas, e 41% de baratas foram explicados por diferencas na identidade das plantas em uma mesma localidade. Demonstramos que mesmo grupos que nAo se alimentam de tecidos vegetais, tais como onivoros e predadores, sAo fortemente afetados pela identidade da planta. A variacAo em escala fina foi mais importante que processos em escala ampla para todos os grupos estudados. Sugerimos que, ao desenvolver comparacoes dos padroes de diversidade entre diferentes escalas com grupos de ordens troficas distintas, podemos compreender como os processos que atuam em escalas regionais, tais como dispersAo, interagem com processos locais para organizar comunidades de artropodes.

AB Disturbance alters the structure and dynamics of communities. Here, we examined the effects of seasonal flooding on the lizard community structure by comparing two adjacent habitats, a seasonally flooded and a non-flooded forest, in a Cerrado-Amazon ecotone area, the CantAo State Park, Tocantins state, Brazil. Despite the strong potential impact of seasonal flooding, the only significant environmental difference detected was more termite mounds in non-flooded forests. Species richness was significantly higher in the non-flooded forest. Colobosaura modesta, followed by Mabuya frenata and Anolis brasiliensis, were the only species that differed in number of captures between sites. Colobosaura modesta was exclusively found in the non-flooded forest, while Anolis brasiliensis was the most captured in the flooded forest. Mabuya frenata is indicated as an indicator species in the flooded forest, and Colobosaura modesta in the non-flooded forest. We found a significant association between lizard abundances and habitat characteristics, with flooding, canopy cover, and logs being the best predictors. A phylogenetic community structure analysis indicated a lack of structure in both lizard assemblages. Overall, we show that seasonal flooding can strongly impact species richness and species occurrence patterns, but not phylogenetic community structure. The Amazon-Cerrado transition is undergoing pronounced transformations due to deforestation and climate change. Despite being species-poor compared with central areas in Amazon or Cerrado, this ecotone harbors species with important adaptations that could hold the key to persistence in human-disturbed landscapes or during periods of climate change.
   Resumo Disturbios podem alterar de maneira intensa a estrutura e a dinamica das comunidades. Nos examinamos os efeitos de inundacoes sazonais na estrutura da comunidade de lagartos comparando duas areas adjacentes, uma sazonalmente inundada e outra nAo inundavel, em um ecotono entre o Cerrado e a Amazonia, o Parque Estadual do CantAo, Tocantins, Brasil. Apesar do intenso impacto do alagamento sazonal, o numero de cupinzeiros foi a unica variavel ambiental que difere entre as areas, sendo significativamente maior na area nAo inundavel. A riqueza foi significativamente maior na floresta nAo inundavel. Colobosaura modesta, seguida por Mabuya frenata e Anolis brasiliensis, foram as unicas especies que diferiram em numero de captura entre as areas. Colobosaura modesta foi exclusivamente encontrada na floresta nAo inundavel, enquanto Anolis brasiliensis foi a mais capturada na floresta inundavel. Mabuya frenata foi evidenciada como especie indicadora da floresta inundavel e Colobosaura modesta da floresta nAo inundavel. Nos encontramos uma associacAo significativa entre a abundancia dos lagartos e as caracteristicas do habitat, sendo a inundacAo, cobertura do dossel e a presenca de troncos caidos os melhores preditores. Uma analise de estrutura filogenetica da comunidade indicou ausencia de estrutura em ambas comunidades. Em suma, nos mostramos que inundacoes sazonais podem impactar fortemente a estrutura das comunidades de lagartos. A transicAo Amazonia-Cerrado esta sofrendo acentuadas transformacoes devido ao desmatamento e mudancas climaticas. Apesar de apresentar baixa riqueza em relacAo a areas mais centrais na Amazonia ou no Cerrado, esse ecotono abriga especies com importantes adaptacoes que podem ser a chave para a persistencia em paisagens impactadas pelo homem ou durante periodos de mudancas climaticas.

AB Species can co-exist within a community when their use of limiting resources is differentiated. To test whether differentiation facilitates coexistence, we quantified differences and overlap in habitat use, fruit consumption, morphological characteristics, and the relationship with vegetation structure for two pairs of ecologically similar frugivorous bat species, Carollia sowelli and C.perspicillata, and Artibeus jamaicensis and A.lituratus. In Carollia sowelli and C.perspicillata, differences in body mass and wing aspect ratio were not reflected in differences in fruit or habitat use (diet overlap, 96 percent; habitat overlap, 98 percent). However, the capture rate of Carollia sowelli positively correlated with canopy openness, and that of C.perspicillata positively correlated with tree height. Body mass and wing characteristics of Artibeus species suggested a greater maneuverability for A.jamaicensis. Also, more A.jamaicensis individuals were captured feeding on Ficus spp., while Artibeus lituratus preferred fruits of the early successional tree Cecropia. However, both habitat overlap and diet overlap were higher than by chance (diet overlap, 75 percent; habitat overlap, 92 percent). The co-existence of the four bat species in the study area may be facilitated by the abundance of the food resources forming part of the diets of both Carollia species, by the morphological differences between the Artibeus species, which allow the differentiation of foraging behavior in relation to fruit consumption, and by the structural characteristics of the vegetation.
   Resumen La coexistencia de especies en una comunidad es posible cuando el uso de recursos limitados se diferencia. Para probar si la diferenciacion facilita la coexistencia, cuantificamos desigualdades y traslapes en el uso de habitat, consumo de frutos, caracteristicas morfologicas, y la relacion con la estructura vegetal en dos pares de especies de murcielagos frugivoros ecologicamente similares: Carollia sowelli y C. perspicillata, y Artibeus jamaicensis y A. lituratus. En C. sowelli y C. perspicillata, las diferencias en masa corporal y la relacion del aspecto alar no se reflejaron en diferencias en el consumo de frutos o uso del habitat (traslape de dieta 96%; traslape de habitat 98%). Sin embargo, la cantidad de capturas de C. sowelli se correlaciono positivamente con la apertura de dosel, y la de C. perspicillata con la altura de los arboles. La masa corporal y caracteristicas morfologicas de las alas de los Artibeus sugieren una mayor maniobrabilidad en A. jamaicensis, igualmente mas individuos de A. jamaicensis fueron capturados alimentandose de Ficus spp., mientras que A. lituratus prefirio frutos de Cecropia, un arbol de etapa sucesional temprana. Sin embargo, el traslape de habitat y la dieta fueron mayores a lo esperado por probabilidad (traslape de dieta 75%; traslape de habitat 92%). La coexistencia de las especies de murcielagos estudiados en el area puede verse facilitada debido a la abundancia de recursos alimenticios que forman parte de la dieta de las dos especies de Carollia, y por las diferencias morfologicas entre las dos especies de Artibeus que permiten la diferenciacion del comportamiento de forrajeo en relacion con el consumo de frutos y las caracteristicas estructurales de la vegetacion.

AB Conversion of diverse native forests to tree monocultures remains an ongoing, worldwide threat to biodiversity. Although the effects of forest conversion have been studied in a wide range of taxonomic groups, the effects on macrofungal communities remain poorly understood. We sampled macrofungal fruiting bodies in the National Forest of SAo Francisco de Paula in Southern Brazil over 12 months in four different forest habitats: native Araucaria angustifolia forest, A.angustifolia plantation, Pinus taeda or P.elliottii plantation, and Eucalyptus saligna plantation. The distribution of macrofungal species in different functional groups varied among habitats: the macrofungal species composition of the A.angustifolia plantation was more similar to that of the native forest, while the exotic Pinus or Eucalyptus plantations were less similar to the native forest. The conversion of native forest to exotic tree plantations reduced the number of macrofungal decomposer species, probably due to changes in substrate availability and quality. We conclude that fungal diversity and ecosystem functionality require the preservation of native, mature forests and suggest a shift of Brazilian forestry guidelines to encourage the plantations of native species instead of exotics.
   Resumo A conversAo de florestas nativas para monoculturas de arvores e uma ameaca constante a biodiversidade em todo o mundo. Apesar de estudos terem avaliado os efeitos da conversAo de florestas para uma variedade de grupos taxonomicos, os efeitos sobre especies de macrofungos e sua diversidade funcional ainda sAo pouco conhecidos. Nos amostramos frutificacoes de macrofungos na Floresta Nacional de SAo Francisco de Paula no sul do Brasil durante doze meses em quatro diferentes habitats florestais: floresta nativa com Araucaria angustifolia, plantacoes de A. angustifolia, bem como plantacoes de especies exoticas de Eucalyptus saligna e plantacoes de Pinus taeda e P. elliottii. A distribuicAo das especies de macrofungos difere nos grupos funcionais e varia entre os ambientes. A composicAo de especies de macrofungos na plantacAo de A. angustifolia mostrou maior similaridade com a floresta nativa do que com outras plantacoes de arvores, enquanto as plantacoes de arvores exoticas sAo mais dissimilares da floresta nativa. A conversAo de floresta nativa para plantacoes de especies exoticas reduziu o numero de especies decompositoras, provavelmente devido a alteracoes na qualidade e disponibilidade de substratos. Nos concluimos que a diversidade de macrofungos e a funcionalidade do ecossistema requerem a preservacAo de florestas nativas primarias, bem como uma mudanca nas diretrizes de silvicultura no Brasil para encorajar o plantio de arvores nativas no lugar das exoticas.

AB Insectivorous birds are known to play a decisive role for the natural control of herbivorous insects. Thus, they enhance the growth, reproduction, and survival of plant individuals and in the long-term benefit plant regeneration. However, particularly in the tropics, forest fragmentation has been suggested to cause a loss of insectivorous birds. Yet, it is unclear whether this hampers the trophic control of herbivorous insects with potential consequences for plants. Therefore, we investigated the effect of increasing forest fragmentation on tritrophic interactions between insectivorous birds, herbivorous insects, and plants in a subtropical forest landscape, South Africa. We monitored the community composition of birds and estimated insectivorous bird abundances along a gradient of forest fragmentation. In the same sites, we installed bird exclosures on a common plant species (Englerophytum natalense) to assess effects of the trophic control of insectivorous birds on herbivorous insects and leaf area loss (LAL). Forest fragmentation strongly shaped the functional composition of bird communities, particularly through a loss of forest-dependent insectivorous birds. Moreover, LAL was higher within bird exclosures than on control branches and increased with increasing forest fragmentation on the control branches. Altogether, forest fragmentation seems to hamper the trophic control of herbivorous insects by insectivorous birds through changes in the community composition. This, in turn, may interfere with tritrophic interactions and ecological processes. Thus, conservation efforts aiming at enhancing the natural control of herbivorous insects should focus on the maintenance of continuous indigenous forests that are well-connected to smaller forest fragments on the landscape scale.

AB The conversion of tropical rain forests to oil palm plantations is a major threat to Southeast Asia's rich biodiversity. Fostering forest species communities in secondary forests, agroforestry systems, and plantations is therefore increasingly becoming a conservation focus. This study uses standardized transect-based sampling to compare species richness, density and community composition of stream anuran assemblages among primary forests, repeatedly logged forests and oil palm plantations in northern Borneo. In primary forest streams, we recorded an average of 19 frog species, compared to 15 species in logged forests and 11 species in oil palm plantation streams. However, the high percentage of canopy cover above the plantation streams mitigated this loss to some extent. This study corroborates numerous studies that oil palm plantations have mainly negative effects on the region's biodiversity. However, our results also demonstrate the high conservation value of logged forests for Bornean stream-dependent anurans. We conclude that palm plantations have a largely unused potential to promote regional anuran biodiversity.

AB Agriculture, particularly pasture, is the second largest source of greenhouse gas emissions from tropical regions. Silvopastoral systems may increase carbon pools in pastures while maintaining productivity. Adding trees to pasture provides carbon sinks in woody biomass, and may improve degraded soils and increase the stability of soil carbon pools. In this study we quantified the biomass carbon stored in spontaneous silvopastoral systems in southeastern Ecuador. We compared the stem density, basal area, aboveground biomass, and organic carbon in the top 20 cm of soil in 100 pastures, ranging from 3 to 250 hectares, in four different communities. Aboveground live woody biomass, calculated using allometric equations and two different wood densities, varied from 10.99 to 66.1 Mg per hectare. Soil organic carbon pools ranged from 85.0 to 97.6 Mg per hectare. Stem density, basal area, and aboveground live biomass all positively correlated with pasture age. We found no relationship between pasture age or stem density and soil organic carbon pools. We measured live woody biomass carbon pools of 34-1070 Mg of carbon per farm in these silvopastoral systems. We found no effects on productivity of the herbaceous layer, suggesting that having a low density of trees in pastures could substantially increase the number of trees and the associated carbon sequestration without affecting cattle production.

AB Patterns of co-occurrence of species are increasingly used to examine the contribution of biotic interactions to community assembly. We assessed patterns of co-occurrence at four scales, in two types of tropical cloud forests in Hainan Island, China (tropical montane evergreen forests, TMEF and tropical dwarf forests, TDF) that varied significantly in soil nutrients and temperature. We tested if the patterns of co-occurrence changed when we sorted species into classes by abundance and diameter at breast height (dbh). Co-occurrence differed by forest type and with plot size, with significant species aggregation observed across larger plots in TDF and patterns of species segregation observed in smaller plots in TMEF. Analyses of differential abundance and dbh classes also showed that smaller plots in TMEF tend to have negative co-occurrence patterns, but larger plots in TDF tend to show patterns of aggregation, suggesting competitive and facilitative interactions. This underscores the scale-dependence of the processes contributing to community assembly. Furthermore, it is consistent with predictions of the stress gradient hypothesis that facilitation will be most important in biological systems subject to abiotic stress, while competition will be more important in less abiotically stressful habitats. Our results clearly demonstrate that these two types of tropical cloud forest exhibit different co-occurrence patterns, and that these patterns are scale-dependent, though independent of plant abundance and size class.

AB Understanding plant species diversity patterns and distributions is critical for conserving and sustainably managing tropical rain forests of high conservation value. We analyzed the alpha-diversity, species abundance distributions, and relative ecological importance of woody species in the Budongo Forest, a remnant forest of the Albertine Rift in Uganda. In 32 0.5-ha plots, we recorded 269 species in 171 genera and 51 families with stems of >= 2.0 cm in diameter at breast height (dbh). There were 53 more species with stems of >= 2.0 cm dbh than with stems of >= 10 cm dbh, of which 33 were treelets and 20 were multi-stemmed shrubs. For both minimum stem diameter cut-offs (i.e., >= 2 cm dbh vs. >= 10 cm dbh), the Fabaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Ulmaceae, and Meliaceae families and the species Cynometra alexandri, Lasiodiscus mildbraedii, and Celtis mildbraedii had the highest relative ecological importance. The relative ecological importance of some species and families changed greatly with the minimum stem diameter measured. Alpha-diversity, species richness, and species abundance distributions varied across historical management practice types, forest community types, and as a function of minimum stem diameter. Species richness and Shannon-Weiner diversity index were greater for species with stems of >= 2.0 cm dbh than of >= 10 cm dbh. The decrease in species evenness with an increasing number of plots was accompanied by an increase in species richness for trees of both minimum diameters. This forest is characterized by a small number of abundant species and a relatively large proportion of infrequent species, many of which are sparsely distributed and with restricted habitats. We recommend lowering the minimum stem diameter measured for woody species diversity studies in tropical forests from 10 cm dbh to 2 cm dbh to include a larger proportion of the species pool.

AB Rapid deforestation has fragmented habitat across the landscape of Madagascar. To determine the effect of fragmentation on seed banks and the potential for forest regeneration, we sampled seed viability, density and diversity in 40 plots of 1m(2) in three habitat types: forest fragments, the near edge of continuous forest, and deforested savanna in a highly fragmented dry deciduous forest landscape in northwestern Madagascar. While seed species diversity was not different between forest fragments and continuous forest edge, the number of animal-dispersed seeds was significantly higher in forest fragments than in continuous forest edge, and this pattern was driven by a single, small-seeded species. In the savanna, seeds were absent from all but three of the 40 plots, indicating that regeneration potential is low in these areas. Several pre- and post-dispersal biotic and abiotic factors, including variation in the seed predator communities and edge effects could explain these findings. Understanding the extent to which seed dispersal and seed banks influence the regeneration potential of fragmented landscapes is critical as these fragments are the potential sources of forest expansion and re-connectivity.
   Resume Le sort de graines dispersees peut etre altere en reponse a la perte et la fragmentation d' habitats, modifiant ainsi les banques de semences du sol. Nous avons echantillonne la viabilite, la densite et la diversite des graines dans 40 parcelles de 1m(2) en trois types d'habitats dans le paysage forestier feuillu, sec, et fragmente du nord-ouest de Madagascar: (1) fragments de foret (2) bords rapproches de foret ininterrompue, et (3) savane deboisee. Notre objectif etait d'etablir l'effet de cette fragmentation sur les banques de semences, et la possibilite de regeneration forestier. Nos resultats demontrent, bien que la diversite des especes de semences ne varie pas entre les fragments de foret et les bords rapproches de foret ininterrompue, que la quantite de graines dispersees par les animaux est considerablement plus elevee dans le premier type d'habitat que dans la deuxieme, et que cet effet est grace a une seule espece [a petites graines]. Dans la savane deboisee, une absence complete de graines a ete notee dans tous les 40 parcelles, a part trois. Plusieurs facteurs biotiques ainsi qu' abiotiques, pre- et post-dispersion, sont impliques, y compris des variations au sein des communautes de predateurs de graines ainsi que des effets de lisiere. Le potentiel de regeneration en paysages fragmentes repose sur une meilleure comprehension de la nature et l'etendue des changements dans la dispersion des graines, ainsi que les resultantes banques de semences. Ceci est particulierement important au Madagascar, oU la perte des forets se poursuit a un rythme precipite, puisque ces fragments sont les sources essentielles de l'expansion et de la reconnexion forestiere.

AB Populations of epiphytic orchids in disturbance-prone environments rarely reach stable-stage equilibrium. We characterized the post-disturbance, transient dynamics of two epiphytic orchids, Broughtonia cubensis, and the leafless Dendrophylax lindenii, comparing the following indices: reactivity/first-time attenuation, maximal amplification/attenuation, and amplified/attenuated inertia. We also assessed the effects of reintroducing only seeds or only adults, by examining the elasticity of the inertia on the vital rates. For 2006-2010, the stochastic growth rate of D.lindenii was (s)=0.94, or a 6 percent decrease per annum. First-time step attenuation indicates that in 1year, the population could decrease by an additional 16 percent, and in the worst-case scenario could decrease by almost half, relative to the stable-stage distribution, in 10years. Broughtonia cubensis had a (s)=1.03; reactivity and first-time step attenuation indicates that in 1year, the population should not change by more than 14 percent of the estimated stable-stage distribution. However, the worst-case scenario projected a reduction of 40 percent relative to the stable-stage distribution within 8years. A comparison of reintroduction strategies assessed by elasticity of the population momentum showed that adults performed better when relocated to new habitats.
   Resumen Las poblaciones de orquideas epifitas en ambientes propensos a perturbaciones rara vez alcanzan el estado de equilibrio estable. Comparamos la dinamica poblacional post-huracan de dos orquideas epifitas, una afila, Dendrophylax lindenii y otra con hojas, Broughtonia cubensis a traves los siguientes indices: reactividad/atenuacion al primer ano; la amplificacion y atenuacion maxima y amplificacion/atenuacion en la inercia. Tambien evaluamos los efectos potenciales de una reintroduccion con solo semillas o con solo los adultos, a traves de la elasticidad de la inercia en las tasas vitales. Para el periodo 2006-2010, la tasa de crecimiento estocastico de D. lindenii era (s) = 0.94, equivalente a una disminucion del 6 por ciento anual. La medida de la atenuacion al ano indica que la poblacion podria disminuir en un 16 por ciento adicional y, en el peor de los casos, se reducira a casi la mitad en relacion a la distribucion estable en 10 anos. Broughtonia cubensis mostro un (s) = 1,03; la reactividad y la atenuacion indican que en 1 ano la poblacion no debe disminuir o aumentar en mas del 14 por ciento en relacion a la estructura estable. Sin embargo, en el peor de los casos, se predice una reduccion del 40 por ciento con respecto a la distribucion establea los 8 anos. Una comparacion de las estrategias de reintroduccion evaluadas por la elasticidad de la inercia demografica mostro que los adultos tuvieron un mejor desempeno cuando fueron trasladados a nuevos habitats.

AB Tropical montane forests comprise heterogeneous environments along natural gradients of topography and elevation. Human-induced edge effects further increase the environmental heterogeneity in these forests. The simultaneous effects of natural and human-induced gradients on the functional diversity of plant leaf traits are poorly understood. In a tropical montane forest in Bolivia, we studied environmental gradients associated with elevation (from 1900m to 2500m asl), topography (ridge and gorge), and edge effects (forest edge vs. forest interior), and their relationship with leaf traits and resource-use strategies. First, we investigated associations of environmental conditions (soil properties and microclimate) with six leaf traits, measured on 119 woody plant species. Second, we evaluated changes in functional composition with community-weighted means and functional structure with multidimensional functional diversity indices (FRic, FEve and FDiv). We found significant associations between leaf traits and soil properties in accordance with the trade-off between acquisition and conservation of resources. Functional composition of leaf traits shifted from the dominance of acquisitive species in habitats at low altitudes, gorges, and forest interior to the dominance of conservative species in habitats at high altitudes, ridges, and forest edges. Functional structure was only weakly associated with the environmental gradients. Natural and human-induced environmental gradients, especially soil properties, are important for driving leaf traits and resource-use strategies of woody plants. Nevertheless, weak associations between functional structure and environmental gradients suggest a high redundancy of functional leaf traits in this tropical montane forest.
   Resumen Los bosques montanos tropicales se caracterizan por presentar una gran heterogeneidad ambiental principalmente debido a gradientes naturales como la topografia y elevacion. Efectos de borde inducidos por el hombre, intensifican esta heterogeneidad ambiental. Poco se conoce acerca de los efectos simultaneos de gradientes ambientales tanto naturales como inducidos por el hombre, sobre la diversidad funcional de caracteres foliares en especies lenosas de estos bosques. En un bosque montano tropical en Bolivia, evaluamos como gradientes ambientales asociados a la elevacion (1900-2500m.s.n.m.), topografia (loma y quebrada) y efecto de borde (borde de bosque vs. bosque interior) se relacionan con caracteres foliares y estrategias de uso de los recursos de las plantas. Primero, evaluamos asociaciones entre condiciones ambientales (propiedades del suelo y microclima) y seis caracteres foliares, medidos en 119 especies de plantas lenosas. Segundo, evaluamos cambios en la composicion funcional mediante la media ponderada de la comunidad (community-weighted mean, CWM) y la estructura funcional mediante indices multirasgo multidimensionales (FRic, FEve and FDiv). Encontramos asociaciones significativas entre caracteres foliares y propiedades del suelo de acuerdo con el trade-off de uso de los recursos entre adquisicion y conservacion de recursos. La composicion funcional de los caracteres foliares cambio de una dominancia de especies adquisitivas en habitats a menor altitud, quebradas y bosque interior a una dominancia de especies conservativas en habitats a mayor altitud, lomas y bordes de bosque. La estructura funcional presento solo una debil asociacion con los gradientes ambientales. Los resultados muestran la importancia de los gradientes ambientales, tanto naturales como inducidos por el hombre, especialmente reflejados en propiedades del suelo como factores determinantes de caracteres funcionales y estrategias de uso de los recursos en especies lenosas. La debil asociacion entre la estructura funcional y los gradientes ambientales sugieren una elevada redundancia en los caracteres foliares de especies lenosas en estos bosques.

AB Although fire- and ant-plant interactions influence the community structure and dynamics of Neotropical savannas, no previous studies have considered their simultaneous effects on target host plants. We monitored the effect of ant exclusion for 3years on leaf area loss to leaf chewing insects, thrips abundance, and reproductive output of the extrafloral nectary-bearing shrub, Peixotoa tomentosa (Malpighiaceae). We predicted that the impact of ants on herbivores and plants would depend on the ant species, and that fire would reduce the effect of ants. We deliberately chose control plants that differed in their occupant ant species. Fire occurred in the second year of the study, allowing us to determine its effect on the benefit afforded by ants. Ants reduced leaf area loss and thrips abundance, and increased fruit and seed production in all 3years. Some ant species were more effective than others, while plants with multiple ant species suffered higher leaf area loss than plants with a single ant species. In the year following the fire, leaf damage was greater than in the other years, regardless of the ant species, and the proportional effect of ants in reducing damage was less. Interactions affecting thrips abundance did not change following fire, nor was the benefit to the plant proportionally reduced. Overall, the identity of the ant species had a greater effect than did the occurrence of fire on the ant-herbivore-plant interaction: the identity of the ant species influenced leaf area loss, thrips numbers, and bud and seed production, while fire only modified the impact of ants on the amount of leaf area consumed by insect herbivores.

AB Plants bearing extrafloral nectaries (EFNs) often have traits typical of pioneer species, and may be expected to proliferate in disturbed habitats. However, a negative effect of disturbance on visitation by attendant ants could prevent EFN-bearing plants from acting as disturbance winners. Here, we address the effects of chronic anthropogenic disturbance on the abundance of EFN-bearing plants and their interactions with attendant ants in Caatinga vegetation of northeastern Brazil. We recorded the abundance of EFN-bearing plants, proportion of plants visited by ants and composition of ant attendant species at 24 sites varying in levels of disturbance. EFN-bearing plants as a whole did not behave as a disturbance winner group. The responses of the 13 species to increasing disturbance were highly variable, with three species declining in abundance (loser species). The richness of ant species attending EFNs did not vary with disturbance, but species composition did. The overall proportion of EFN-bearing plants attended by ants per 5-min period was not affected by disturbance. However, for the three loser species, attendance decreased from about 50 percent with low and moderate disturbance to half that with very high disturbance. We hypothesize that disturbed sites are more stressful for loser species compared with other EFN-bearing plants, with physiological stress resulting in lower production of EFN secretions and reduced attraction of ants. This would make such species double losers, with physiological stress at disturbed sites not only directly influencing their performance but also indirectly affecting it through the disruption of a key mutualism.

AB Movement patterns of frugivorous birds may be altered in anthropogenically fragmented landscapes, with possible consequences for seed dispersal and plant recruitment. We studied the movement patterns and functional connectivity of six frugivorous bird species (Colaptes melanochloros, Thraupis bonariensis, Pitangus sulphuratus, Saltator aurantiirostris, Turdus amaurochalinus, and Elaenia spp.) in a fragmented Chaco-woodland landscape in Argentina. We recorded the directions of bird movements (arrivals and departures) and whether their destination was oriented toward a specific neighboring fragment. We evaluated the movement rates, distance of interpatch movement, and functional connectivity within the landscape for the six bird species. We applied a novel approach, graph theory, to represent bird movement patterns in the landscape and the functional connections among fragments for each bird species. Bird movements were recorded at point-count stations established along the edges of each fragment. The directions of arrival and departure movements from and to neighboring fragments revealed complex movement patterns. However, the destination of bird movements after leaving the focal fragments was usually concentrated on only a few neighboring fragments of different sizes. Pitangus sulphuratus and T.bonariensis showed larger movement rates and higher functional connectivity (number of graphs and functional area) than the other frugivorous species. The functional connectivity mediated by movement of frugivorous birds may promote seed dispersal of many bird-dispersed plant species. As forest loss and fragmentation of Chaco subtropical forests increase, understanding the pivotal role of mobile links exerted by avian seed dispersers is vital to maintaining and conserving this unique ecosystem.
   Resumen Los patrones de movimiento de las especies de aves frugivoras pueden ser alterados en paisajes fragmentados modificados por el hombre con posibles consecuencias en la dispersion de semillas y reclutamiento posterior de las plantas. Estudiamos los patrones de movimiento y la conectividad funcional en seis especies de aves frugivoras (Colaptes melanochloros, Thraupis bonariensis, Pitangus sulphuratus, Saltator aurantiirostris, Turdus amaurochalinus, Elaenia spp.) en un paisaje fragmentado de bosque Chaqueno en Argentina. Registramos la direccion del desplazamiento de las aves (llegadas y partidas) y si el destino de los desplazamientos estuvo orientado a algun fragmento vecino especifico. Tambien evaluamos la tasa de desplazamiento, distancia de desplazamiento entre fragmentos y conectividad funcional de los fragmentos para las seis especies de aves en el paisaje fragmentado. Aplicamos un enfoque novedoso, la teoria de grafos, para representar los patrones de movimientos de aves en el paisaje y la conectividad funcional entre fragmentos para cada especie de ave. El desplazamiento de las aves fue registrado en puntos de conteo establecidos en el borde de cada fragmento. La direccion de los desplazamientos de llegada y partida desde y hacia los fragmentos vecinos revelo patrones complejos de desplazamiento. Sin embargo, el destino de los desplazamientos de las aves luego de salir de los fragmentos focales estuvo usualmente concentrado solo hacia algunos fragmentos vecinos de diferente area. Pitangus sulphuratus y T.bonariensis presentaron mayores tasas de desplazamiento y una mayor conectividad funcional (numero de grafos y area funcional) en comparacion con las otras especies frugivoras. La conectividad funcional mediada por los desplazamientos de las aves frugivoras podria tener un rol importante en promover la dispersion de semillas de muchas especies de plantas ornitocoras. Mientras la perdida y la fragmentacion de los bosques subtropicales Chaquenos siga aumentando, se hace imprescindible la comprension del rol fundamental que ejercen las aves dispersoras de semillas como conectores moviles para el mantenimiento y conservacion de este ecosistema unico.

AB To understand the mechanisms driving species diversity is central to community ecology. Here, we explored if habitat partitioning is associated with a species-rich ectoparasite community in small rodents from a tropical dry forest in western Mexico. We trapped 199 mice in three 0.5ha-plots from eight small rodent species for every two months, from July 2011 to April 2012, and collected their ectoparasites. We identified 17 species of mites, two sucking lice species, two phoretic species, and one commensal species. The most abundant ectoparasite species was Steptolaelaps liomydis, representing 42 percent of all ectoparasites collected; seven ectoparasite species had < 10 individuals. Eighteen ectoparasite species (of 22 species) were collected from the most abundant rodent Liomys pictus. C-score and the number of checkerboard species pairs were significantly higher against a random expectation. Ectoparasite species in L.pictus mice showed host microhabitat partitioning; Fahrenholzia ehrlichi and Fahrenholzia texana were found only in the anterior dorsal area, Ornithonysus sp. occurred along the dorsal part, Ixodes species were restricted to the ears, and Steptolaelaps liomydis was found throughout the body. We also identified ectoparasite communities with distinct species composition in two rodent species that use contrasting macrohabitats (L.pictus, strictly terrestrial; Peromyscus perfulvus, mostly arboreal). The remaining and low abundant rodent species showed a species-poor ectoparasite community composition. We conclude that habitat partitioning at both macro and microhabitat scales appeared to characterize the species-rich ectoparasite community. Conversely, most rodent host species with low abundances showed a species-poor ectoparasite community.
   Resumen Entender los mecanismos que promueven la diversidad de especies es una pregunta central en ecologia de comunidades. En este trabajo exploramos si la reparticion del habitat se utiliza como mecanismo para mantener una comunidad rica en especies de ectoparasitos. Se colectaron 199 individuos roedores pequenos, pertenecientes a ocho especies, con trampas Sherman en tres parcelas de ca. 0,5 ha, en un bosque tropical seco del oeste de Mexico, de julio de 2011 a abril de 2012. Se colectaron los ectoparasitos al momento de la manipulacion de los roedores capturados en campo y en el laboratorio. Se identificaron 17 especies de acaros, dos especies de piojos y dos especies foreticas y una comensal. La especie mas abundante de ectoparasitos fue Steptolaelaps liomydis, que represento alrededor del 42 por ciento de los individuos colectados; siete especies tuvieron <10 individuos. 18 de las 22 especies de ectoparasitos se colectaron del roedor mas abundante Liomys pictus. El C-Score y el numero de pares de especies fueron significativamente mayores a los esperados por azar. Se documento que en L.pictus existe una reparticion de los ectoparasitos en su habitat del hospedero; Fahrenholzia ehrlichi y Fahrenholzia texana fueron encontradas en el area dorsal-anterior, Ornithonysus sp., se observo en la parte dorsal del cuerpo, las especies de Ixodes solo fueron encontradas en las orejas y, Steptolaelaps liomydis, se observo en todo el cuerpo. Asimismo, se identificaron dos comunidades con una composicion distinta de ectoparasitos en dos especies de roedores con habitat contrastantes (L.pictus, terrestre estricto; Peromyscus perfulvus, principalmente arboreo); las demas especies de roedores que fueron poco abundantes, mostraron una comunidad con pocas especies de ectoparasitos. Se concluye que la reparticion del macrohabitat y microhabitat caracteriza una comunidad rica en ectoparasitos. Por otro lado las espeies de roedores poco abundantes mostraron una comunidad pobre de especies de ectoparasitos.

AB Most social animals have mechanisms to distinguish group members from outsiders, in part to prevent the exploitation of resources reserved for members of the group. Nevertheless, specialized thieves of the Neotropical ant, Ectatomma ruidum, also known as the thieving ant', regularly enter and steal resources from distinct, neighboring colonies. Here, we examine the mechanisms and consequences of thievery in a population of E.ruidum. We show that (1) individuals from nearby colonies were accepted more often than those from farther colonies; (2) rejection rates decreased as individuals interacted more with non-nestmates from the same source colony; and (3) colonies that were experimentally treated to reduce thievery rates had improved productivity. The boost in productivity with thievery reduction was greater in low density populations than in high density populations. We conclude that, as in other species, thievery has negative fitness costs to E.ruidum. However, greater acceptance of neighbors than non-neighbors and increased acceptance after habituation to non-nestmates suggest a proximate explanation for the presence of thievery. Moreover, lower fitness costs of thievery at high nesting density, combined with observations of extraordinarily high densities of E.ruidum throughout its range, suggest there is little selection pressure among these ants to guard against thieves, thus providing an ultimate explanation why thievery persists among litter-foraging ants.
   Resumen La mayoria de los animales sociales tienen mecanismos para discernir entre miembros propios de los ajenos al grupo, en parte para prevenir la explotacion de recursos reservados para el grupo. En contraste con este patron, hormigas especializadas de la especie Neotropical Ectatomma ruidum, conocida como hormiga ladrona, regularmente roban recursos de colonias vecinas. En este trabajo examinamos los mecanismos y consecuencias del robo en una poblacion de E.ruidum y mostramos que: (1) las hormigas de colonias vecinas cercanas fueron aceptadas mas frecuentemente que hormigas de colonias lejanas; (2) el grado de rechazo disminuyo cuando hubo interaccion mas frecuente con hormigas ajenas provenientes de una misma colonia, y (3) las colonias tratadas experimentalmente para reducir el grado de robo tuvieron mayor productividad comparadas con colonias donde las ladronas permanecieron. El aumento en productividad fue mas evidente en poblaciones pequenas. En contraste, las colonias con alta densidad poblacional no mostraron un incremento en productividad evidente despues de remover a las ladronas. Concluimos que, al igual que en otras especies, el robo tiene costos negativos en el fitness. Sin embargo, la mayor aceptacion de vecinas que no-vecinas y el incremento en aceptacion despues de un periodo de habituacion a las foraneas sugiere una posible explicacion para la presencia del robo. Ademas, mostramos que hay un menor costo de fitness por robo en nidos populosos. Esta observacion, combinada con el hecho de que E.ruidum prevalece en altas densidades poblacionales ofrece una explicacion a la persistencia del robo entre hormigas de la hojarasca.

AB Land-use intensification has consequences for biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, with various taxonomic groups differing widely in their sensitivity. As land-use intensification alters habitat structure and resource availability, both factors may contribute to explaining differences in animal species diversity. Within the local animal assemblages the flying vertebrates, bats and birds, provide important and partly complementary ecosystem functions. We tested how bats and birds respond to land-use intensification and compared abundance, species richness, and community composition across a land-use gradient including forest, traditional agroforests (home garden), coffee plantations and grasslands on Mount Kilimanjaro, Tanzania. Furthermore, we asked how sensitive different habitat and feeding guilds of bats and birds react to land-use intensification and the associated alterations in vegetation structure and food resource availability. In contrast to our expectations, land-use intensification had no negative effect on species richness and abundance of all birds and bats. However, some habitat and feeding guilds, in particular forest specialist and frugivorous birds, were highly sensitive to land-use intensification. Although the habitat guilds of both, birds and bats, depended on a certain degree of vegetation structure, total bat and bird abundance was mediated primarily by the availability of the respective food resources. Even though the highly structured southern slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro are able to maintain diverse bat and bird assemblages, the sensitivity of avian forest specialists against land-use intensification and the dependence of the bat and bird habitat guilds on a certain vegetation structure demonstrate that conservation plans should place special emphasis on these guilds.

AB Habitat modification can homogenize biological communities. Beta diversity analyses provide key information for understanding biotic homogenization, especially given recent conceptual and methodological advances. Here, we investigated if landscape modification was associated with taxonomic homogenization in 32 stream insect communities from the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We investigated: (1) if the way we defined landscape affected our estimates of beta diversity; (2) to what extent changes in species composition versus relative abundance caused the observed homogenization; and (3) if environmental heterogeneity among modified habitats influenced homogenization. We detected taxonomic homogenization caused by landscape modification only when we used refined landscape categorizations and abundance-based diversity measures. For forested streams, changes in relative abundance rather than absolute taxonomic composition increased the biological variation. Forested streams were generally more heterogeneous, with a variable set of abundant genera; by contrast, non-forested streams were more homogeneous, with the same set of genera being more or less abundant. We suggest that landscape modification by agriculture, pasture, and silviculture reduces beta diversity by limiting the colonization of potential species, and, ultimately, causing taxonomic homogenization. Studies investigating biotic homogenization should include multiple dissimilarity measures representing changes in relative species abundance and community composition.

Detectamos homogeneizacAo taxonomica causada por modificacoes na paisagem somente quando usamos uma categorizacAo refinada de paisagens e medidas de diversidade beta baseadas em abundancia. Entre os riachos florestados, mudancas na abundancia relativa, e nAo na composicAo taxonomica absoluta, aumentaram a variacAo biologica. Riachos florestados foram, de modo geral, mais heterogeneos biologicamente, com um conjunto variavel de generos dominantes; por outro lado, riachos nAo florestados foram mais homogeneos, com o mesmo conjunto de generos sendo mais ou menos abundantes. Nos sugerimos que a modificacAo da paisagem pela agricultura, pastagem e silvicultura reduz diversidade beta, limitando a colonizacAo de especies potenciais, consequentemente, causando homogeneizacAo taxonomica. Estudos investigando homogeneizacAo biotica devem incluir diferentes medidas de dissimilaridade que representam mudancas na abundancia relativa das especies e na composicAo taxonomica da comunidade.

AB According to its advocates, an ecosystem-services-based approach to conservation will engender greater public support and produce more durable victories. Here, we identify three potential opportunity costs associated with such an approach: (1) diminished attention to protecting rare, localized species (the night parrot effect); (2) diminished attention to protecting wild, remote areas (the proximity-to-people effect); and (3) an emphasis on restoration projects near urban areas rather than the protection of relatively intact ecosystems (the rise-of-restoration effect). We encourage scientists and conservation practitioners to undertake the necessary monitoring and research to determine the magnitude of these opportunity costs.

AB Myrmecochory, or seed dispersal by ants, occurs widely in angiosperms, and particularly in temperate forest herbs in the northern Hemisphere and sclerophyll shrubs in Mediterranean-climate landscapes. The lipid-rich elaiosome on the seed provides nutrition to the ants; however, how the plant benefits from myrmecochory remains unclear. Here, we provide the first comprehensive analysis of the Euphorbiaceae species in the semi-arid Caatinga vegetation region of northeastern Brazil, and show that myrmecochory strongly associates with small plant stature, even after controlling for seed size. The association of myrmecochory with small stature suggests that the primary benefit to plants concerns distance of dispersal, which reduces parental and sibling competition.

Contudo, os beneficios de terem suas sementes dispersas pelas formigas permanecem desconhecidos para a maioria das especies.

AB We show in laboratory and field investigations that in the short-term seagrasses obtain most of their required nitrogen from the degradation of seagrass leaves, rather than degradation of leaves exported from adjacent mangroves. Mangrove forests at our Thailand site retain the majority of their nutrients, and therefore potentially buffer seagrasses from nutrients.

AB Climate changes during the Pleistocene produced shifts, reductions, and expansions of biomes that, in turn, have been hypothesized to have driven speciation and extinction and shaped patterns of biodiversity. Here, we explore effects of Late Pleistocene climatic changes on environmentally and geographically cohesive areas mimicking species' distributions. We analyzed persistence of these species' over the transition from the warm Last Interglacial period to the cool Last Glacial Maximum period to warm present-day conditions, for four levels of environmental restriction (5, 10, 15 and 20% of overall variation; akin to niche breadths). African environments were overall much less conserved over these periods than those of South America, matching diversity contrasts between the two continents. Results thus indicate that biodiversity patterns relate closely to historical patterns of environmental grain and their stability through time; this view is a step toward an integral understanding of the role of environmental and geographic factors in the process of biological diversification.

AB Fertilization experiments in tropical forests have shown that litterfall increases in response to the addition of one or more soil nutrients. However, the relationship between soil nutrient availability and litterfall is poorly defined along natural soil fertility gradients, especially in tropical montane forests. Here, we measured litterfall for two years in five lower montane 1-ha plots spanning a soil fertility and precipitation gradient in lower montane forest at Fortuna, Panama. Litterfall was also measured in a concurrent nitrogen fertilization experiment at one site. Repeated-measures ANOVA was used to test for site (or treatment), year, and season effects on vegetative, reproductive and total litterfall. We predicted that total litterfall, and the ratio of reproductive to leaf litterfall, would increase with nutrient availability along the fertility gradient, and in response to nitrogen addition. We found that total annual litterfall varied substantially among 1-ha plots (4.78Mg/ha/yr to 7.96Mg/ha/yr), and all but the most aseasonal plot showed significant seasonality in litterfall. However, litterfall accumulation did not track soil nutrient availability; instead forest growing on relatively infertile soil, but dominated by an ectomycorrhizal tree species, had the highest total litterfall accumulation. In the fertilization plots, significantly more total litter fell in nitrogen addition relative to control plots, but this increase in response to nitrogen (13%) was small compared to variation observed among 1-ha plots. These results suggest that while litterfall at Fortuna is nutrient-limited, compositional and functional turnover along the fertility gradient obscure any direct relationship between soil resource availability and canopy productivity.
   Resumen Se demostro con experimentos de fertilizacion en bosques tropicales incrementos en la caida de hojarasca asociados con la adicion de nutrientes; empero, se desconoce la relacion entre la disponibilidad de nutrientes del suelo con la produccion de hojarasca en gradientes naturales de fertilidad del suelo, especialmente en bosques montanos tropicales. Medimos la produccion de hojarasca durante dos anos en cinco parcelas (1-ha) en bosques montanos bajos, sobre gradientes de fertilidad y precipitacion y en un experimento paralelo de fertilizacion de nitrogeno en la Reserva Forestal Fortuna, Panama. Predijimos incrementos de hojarasca total y reproductiva con la disponibilidad de nutrientes en el gradiente de fertilidad del suelo y en respuesta a la adicion de nitrogeno (13%). Encontramos que la hojarasca total varia sustancialmente entre parcelas (4.78 Mg/ha/yr hasta 7.96 Mg/ha/yr) y que en todas las parcelas, excepto la menos estacional, hay estacionalidad significativa en la cantidad de hojarasca; pero, la acumulacion de hojarasca no coincide con la disponibilidad de nutrientes en el suelo, porque el bosque sobre suelo poco fertil con dominio de una especie ectomicorricica, presento mayor acumulacion de hojarasca. Las parcelas con fertilizacion tenian significativamente mas hojarasca que las control; pero, el incremento en hojarasca en respuesta a la adicion de nitrogeno fue menor respecto a la variacion entre parcelas. Los resultados sugieren que mientras la produccion de hojarasca en Fortuna es limitada por nutrientes, la variacion en la composicion de especies a traves de gradientes de fertilidad ocultan cualquier relacion directa entre la disponibilidad de nutrientes del suelo y la productividad del dosel.

AB Negative density dependence contributes to seedling dynamics in forested ecosystems, but the relative importance of this factor for different woody plant life-forms is not well-understood. We used 1yr of seedling survivorship data for woody seedlings in 17 different plots of lower to mid-montane rain forests on the island of Dominica to examine how seedling height, abiotic factors, and biotic factors such as negative density dependence are related to seedling survival of five different life-forms (canopy, midstory, and understory trees; shrubs; and lianas). Across 64 species, taller seedlings in seedling plots with higher canopy openness, greater seedling density, lower relative abundance of conspecific seedlings, and lower relative abundance of conspecific adults generally had a greater probability of surviving. Height was the strongest predictor of seedling survival for all life-forms except lianas. Greater seedling density was positively related to survival for canopy and midstory trees but negatively related to survival for the other life-forms. For trees, the relative abundance of conspecific seedling and adult neighbors had weak and strong negative effects on survival respectively. Neither shrub nor liana seedling survival was affected by the relative abundance of conspecific neighbors. Thus, negative density dependence is confirmed as an important structuring mechanism for tree seedling communities but does not seem to be important for lianas and shrubs in Dominican rain forests. These results represent the first direct assessment of controls on seedling survival of all woody life-forms - an important step in understanding the dynamics and structure of the entire woody plant community.

AB Gap dynamics theory proposes that treefall gaps provide high light levels needed for regeneration in the understory, and by increasing heterogeneity in the light environment allow light-demanding tree species to persist in the community. Recent studies have demonstrated age-related declines in leaf area index of individual temperate trees, highlighting a mechanism for gradual changes in the forest canopy that may also be an important, but less obvious, driver of forest dynamics. We assessed the prevalence of age-related crown thinning among 12 tropical canopy tree species sampled in lowland forests in Panama and Puerto Rico (total N=881). Canopy gap fraction of individual canopy tree crowns was positively related to stem diameter at 1.3m (diameter at breast height) in a pooled analysis, with 10 of 12 species showing a positive trend. Considered individually, a positive correlation between stem diameter and canopy gap fraction was statistically significant in 4 of 12 species, all of which were large-statured canopy to emergent species: Beilschmiedia pendula, Ceiba pentandra, Jacaranda copaia, and Prioria copaifera. Pooled analyses also showed a negative relationship between liana abundance and canopy gap fraction, suggesting that lianas could be partially obscuring age-related crown thinning. We conclude that age-related crown thinning occurs in tropical forests, and could thus influence patterns of tree regeneration and tropical forest community dynamics.

AB Woody tree species in seasonally dry tropical forests are known to have traits that help them to recover from recurring disturbances such as fire. Two such traits are resprouting and rapid post-fire growth. We compared survival and growth rates of regenerating small-sized individuals (juveniles) of woody tree species after dry season fire (February-March) at eight adjacent pairs of burnt and unburnt transects in a seasonally dry tropical forest in southern India. Juveniles were monitored at 3-mo intervals between August 2009 and August 2010. High juvenile survivorship (>95%) was observed in both burnt and unburnt areas. Growth rates of juveniles, analyzed at the community level as well as for a few species individually (especially fast-growing ones), were distinctly higher in burnt areas compared to unburnt areas after a fire event, particularly during the pre-monsoon season immediately after a fire. Rapid growth by juveniles soon after a fire may be due to lowered competition from other vegetative forms such as grasses, possibly aided by the availability of resources stored belowground. Such an adaptation would allow a juvenile bank to be retained in the understory of a dry forest, from where individuals can grow to a possible fire-tolerant size during favorable conditions.

AB In species-rich ecosystems, such as subtropical and tropical forests, higher trophic level interactions are key mediators of ecosystem functioning. Plant species loss may alter these interactions, but the effects of plant diversity might be modified by intraguild interactions, particularly among predators. We analyzed the relationships between spiders and ants, two dominant predatory arthropod taxa, on tree saplings across a gradient from medium to high woody plant species richness in a subtropical forest in Southeast China. Neither ant nor spider total biomass was significantly related to plant species richness. By contrast, the biomass distribution of web-building and hunting spiders changed and spider family richness increased in the presence of ants, resulting in more web builder-dominated assemblages. However, these relationships depended on the plant communities, and were stronger in plots with higher plant species richness. Our results indicate that in addition to potential effects of ants on hunting spiders in particular, ants could indirectly influence intraguild interactions within spider assemblages. The observed shifts in the spider assemblages with increasing ant presence and plant species richness may have functional consequences, as web-building and hunting spiders have distinct prey spectra. The relationships among ants, spiders, and plant species richness might contribute to explaining the non-significant relationship between the overall effects of predators and plant diversity previously observed in the same forest plots. Our findings thus give insight into the complexity of biotic interactions in such species-rich ecosystems.

AB Defensive mutualisms mediated by extrafloral nectaries are particularly variable; their net results may change with seasons, communities and environmental contexts. Particularly, an environmental factor that can promote changes in outcomes of ant-plant interactions is elevation in mountainous regions. We tested whether (1) the interaction between the cactus Opuntia sulphurea and ant visitors of extrafloral nectaries is a defensive mutualism; and (2) ant-plant interaction outcomes vary with elevation as a result of changes in herbivory rate and ant activity. To evaluate if the outcome of interactions was consistent at two extremes of the range distribution of O.sulphurea, we performed an ant-exclusion experiment with plants at two growth conditions (natural or potted) in two sites with contrasting elevation (1235-1787m asl) in a temperate region (Villavicencio Nature Reserve, Mendoza, Argentina), and in a tropical region (Huajchilla, La Paz, Bolivia). Although herbivory rate and ant visitation frequency increased with elevation, herbivore damage, plant reproductive success, and cladode growth rate were similar between plants excluded and non-excluded from ants among sites, geographic regions and growth conditions. These results do not support the hypotheses that the interaction between O.sulphurea and ants is a defensive mutualism, and that elevation affects the net outcome of this ant-plant interaction.
   Resumen Los mutualismos de defensa mediados por nectarios extraflorales son particularmente variables; sus resultados netos pueden cambiar con el contexto ambiental, la composicion comunitaria y las estaciones. Un factor ambiental que podria cambiar el resultado de las interacciones hormiga-planta es la variacion de la altitud en zonas montanosas. Nosotros propusimos que (1) la interaccion entre Opuntia sulphurea y las hormigas que visitan sus nectarios extraflorales es un mutualismo de defensa; y (2) que los resultados de esta interaccion varian con la altitud debido a cambios en la tasa de herbivoria y la actividad de las hormigas. Para evaluar si los resultados de la interaccion eran consistentes entre los extremos de la distribucion de O. sulphurea, excluimos las hormigas de plantas que crecian en dos condiciones diferentes (natural y en maceta), en dos sitios con altitud contrastante (1235 y 1787m asl), en una region templada (La Reserva Natural Villavicencio, Mendoza, Argentina) y en una tropical (Huajchilla, La Paz, Bolivia). A pesar de que la tasa de herbivoria y la frecuencia de visita de las hormigas aumentaron con la altitud, el dano por herbivoria, el exito reproductivo y la tasa de crecimiento de los cladodios fue similar entre las plantas con y sin hormigas en las dos condiciones de crecimiento, sitios de altitud contrastante y regiones geograficas. Estos resultados no apoyan la hipotesis que la interaccion entre O. sulphurea y las hormigas es un mutualismo de defensa, asi como tampoco que la altitud afecta el resultado de esta interaccion.

AB Migration is a common life-history strategy that includes traits such as directed flight, increased wing size, seasonal lipid deposition and reproductive arrest. The degree of investment in these traits ultimately determines the life-history strategy of individuals. Partial migration is a common mixed life-history strategy where species or populations consist of both migrant and resident individuals. While this phenomenon is widespread across taxa, the ecological factors that select for and maintain partial migration are poorly understood, especially among insects. Here, we investigate regional life-history traits associated with migration in the southern monarch, Danaus erippus, and describe a mixed life-history strategy in this butterfly. Individuals from the Bolivian lowlands were observed throughout the year exhibiting mate- and milkweed-directed behaviors. These butterflies had smaller wings, lower wing loads and maintained constant lipid and egg loads across summer and autumn months. Danaus erippus in the highlands of the Bolivian Andes were observed only in the summer and autumn months, during which they also showed mate- and milkweed-directed behaviors. These individuals possessed similar-sized wings and maintained similar lipid and egg loads as the lowland butterflies. In contrast, individuals from northwest Argentina showed persistent, directed, southwesterly flight during the autumn (March-May), larger wing size, higher wing loads, and increased autumn lipid deposition along with decreased egg production. These data indicate that D.erippus utilizes a mixed life-history strategy with a combination of residents and migrants in the Bolivian lowlands, elevational migrants in the Bolivian Andes, and latitudinal migrants in northwestern Argentina.
   Resumen La migracion es una estrategia de historia de vida utilizada frecuentemente que incluyecaracteristicas tales como el vuelo dirigido, el aumento del tamano del ala, el aumento de lipidos y el paro de la actividad reproductiva por temporadas. La estrategia de historia de vida de los individuos esta determinada por el grado de inversion de los mismos con cada una de estas caracteristicas. La migracion parcial es una estrategia de historia de vida mixta muy comun en la cual las especies o poblaciones estan conformadas por algunos individuos migratorios y otros residentes. A pesar de que este fenomeno es comun entre los taxa, los factores ecologicos que seleccionan y mantienen la migracion parcial no han sido propiamente estudiados, especialmente en los insectos. Este ensayo investiga las caracteristicas regionales de la historia de vida asociadas con la migracion de la monarca del sur,Danaus erippus, y describe una estrategia de historia de vida mixta en esta mariposa. Se observaron individuos de la zona baja de Bolivia a lo largo del ano, y estos exhibieron comportamientos caracteristicos del apareamiento -vuelo irregular- y de la cercania a las hierbas de leche (Asclepiasspp.). Estas mariposas tenian alas mas cortas y mantuvieron cargas constantes de lipidos y ovulos durante los meses de verano y otono. LasD.erippusde los terrenos altos de los Andes bolivianos fueron observadas solo en los meses de verano y otono, durante los cuales tambien demostraron comportamientos caracteristicos del apareamiento -vuelo irregular- y de la cercania a las hierbas de leche. Estos individuos tenian tamanos de alasy cargas de lipidos y ovulos similares a los de las mariposas de las zonas bajas. Por el contrario, los individuos del noroeste argentino presentaron un vuelo dirigido y persistente, hacia el sur-oeste, durante el otono (marzo-mayo), asi como tambien alas de mayor tamano, y un aumento en la cantidad de lipidos durante el otono conjuntamente con una disminucion de la produccion de ovulos. Estos datos indican que D.erippus utiliza una estrategia de historia de vida mixta con una combinacion de individuos residentes y migratorios en las zonas bajas de Bolivia, migratorios en las elevaciones de los Andes bolivianos y migratorios latitudinales en el noroeste de Argentina.

AB In tropical rain forests, high canopy trees have diverse and abundant populations of ants and spiders. However, accessing high trees and their fauna remains difficult; thus, how ants and spiders interact in the canopy remains unclear. To better understand the interspecific interactions between these two dominant arthropod groups, we investigated their spatial distributions at the canopy surface in a tropical rain forest in Borneo. We sampled ants and spiders six times between 2009 and 2011 by sweeping with an insect net at the tree crown surfaces of 190 emergent or tall (20m in height) trees. We collected 438 ant individuals belonging to 94 species and 1850 spider individuals (1630 juveniles and 220 adults) belonging to 142 morphospecies (adults only) from a total of 976 samples. The fact that we collected four times more spider individuals than ant individuals suggests that fewer ants forage at the tree crown surface than previously thought. The number of spider individuals negatively correlated with the number of ant individuals and the number of ant species, indicating significant exclusivity between ant and spider spatial distributions at the tree crown surface. Niche-overlap between the two taxa confirmed this observation. Although our data do not address the causes of these spatial distributions, antagonistic interspecific interactions such as interference behaviors and intra-guild predation are ecological mechanisms that give rise to exclusive spatial distributions.

AB River damming has created fragmented landscapes in parts of the Amazon basin. The resulting decrease in forest area could directly affect amphibian species if large areas of habitat are required to guarantee the presence of specific types of breeding sites. Here, we describe the anuran assemblages on islands created by damming of the Tocantins River twenty years ago in the eastern Amazon basin. We surveyed 10 undisturbed islands varying in size from 3 to 2140ha and located at distances of up to 6.7km from the margin of the reservoir. We identified 32 frog species, of which 15, 14, and 3 have aquatic, semiaquatic, and terrestrial development, respectively. The number of frog species increased significantly with island area but was not affected by island distance from the margin. Species with aquatic or semiaquatic development tended to be absent from the smaller islands, regardless of the degree of isolation from the mainland. These findings emphasize the need to preserve specific microhabitats on smaller land-bridge islands to maintain amphibian diversity in reservoir environments.
   Resumo O represamento de rios para a instalacAo de hidreletricas tem contribuido significativamente para a reducAo de areas florestadas da Bacia Amazonica. Assim, se grandes areas de florestas sAo fundamentais para a manutencAo de especificos sitios reprodutivos, entAo a fragmentacAo causada pelo represamento de rios afetara diretamente as comunidades de anfibios remanescentes. Neste estudo avaliamos as assembleias de anuros remanescentes em ilhas de florestas originadas apos o represamento do Rio Tocantins, Amazonia Oriental. Nos amostramos 10 ilhas que variaram de tres a 2140ha de area, e localizadas ate 6.7km de distancia da margem do reservatorio. Nos encontramos 32 especies de anuros, 15 com desenvolvimento direto, 14 com desenvolvimento semi-aquatico e tres com desenvolvimento terrestre. O numero de especies aumentou significativamente com a area da ilha, mas nAo foi influenciado pela distancia da margem do reservatorio. As especies com desenvolvimento aquatico ou semi-aquatico tenderam a nAo ocorrer nas ilhas menores, independente delas estarem perto ou longe da margem do reservatorio. Estes resultados tem importante implicacAo para a conservacAo e restauracAo de ilhas formadas pelo represamento de rios para a construcAo de hidreletricas, enfatizando a necessidade de se preservar ilhas menores que tenham especificos habitats ou ilhas grandes o suficiente para manter sitios reprodutivos que contribuam para a manutencAo da diversidade de anfibios nestes ambientes remanescentes.

AB Conversion of tropical forests to agriculture affects vertebrate assemblages, but we do not know how fast or to what extent these assemblages recover after field abandonment. We addressed this question by examining amphibians and reptiles in secondary forests in southeastern Mexico. We used chronosequence data (12 secondary forests fallow for 1-23yr and 3 old-growth forest sites) to analyze successional trajectories and estimate recovery times of assemblage attributes for amphibians and reptiles. We conducted 6 surveys at each site over 14mo (1200 person-hours) and recorded 1552 individuals, including 25 species of amphibians and 36 of reptiles, representing 96 and 74 percent of the expected regional number of species, respectively. Abundance, species richness, and species diversity of amphibians increased rapidly with successional age, approaching old-growth forest values in < 30yr. Species richness and species diversity of reptiles reached old-growth forest values in < 20yr. By contrast, the abundance of reptiles and the assemblage composition of amphibians and reptiles recovered more slowly. Along the chronosequence, we observed more species replacement in reptile assemblages than in amphibian assemblages. Several species in the old-growth forest were absent from secondary forests. Dispersal limitation and harsh conditions prevailing in open sites and early successional environments appear to preclude colonization by old-growth forest species. Furthermore, short fallow periods and isolation of forest remnants lead to the formation of new assemblages dominated by species favored by human disturbances.
   Resumen La conversion de los bosques tropicales en campos agropecuarios afecta a los ensambles de vertebrados, pero no sabemos en que medida y con que rapidez estos ensambles se recuperan despues del abandono de los campos. Exploramos este aspecto para el caso de los anfibios y reptiles en el sureste de Mexico. Basados en datos de una cronosecuencia (12 bosques secundarios con edades de 1-23 anos de desarrollo y tres sitios de bosques maduro), analizamos trayectorias sucesionales para estimar los tiempos de recuperacion de diferentes atributos de los ensambles de anfibios y reptiles. En cada sitio, se llevaron a cabo seis muestreos a lo largo de 14 meses (1200 horas persona en total). Globalmente, se registraron 1552 individuos, 25 especies de anfibios y 36 de reptiles, lo que represento el 96% y el 74% del numero esperado de especies regionales, respectivamente. La abundancia, la riqueza de especies y la diversidad de especies de anfibios se incrementaron rapidamente con la edad sucesional, acercandose a los valores del bosque maduro en menos de tres decadas. La riqueza de especies y la diversidad de especies de reptiles alcanzaron valores del bosque maduro en menos de 20 anos. Por el contrario, la recuperacion de la abundancia de reptiles fue mucho mas lenta como fue tambien el caso de la composicion del ensamble de anfibios y reptiles. A lo largo de la cronosecuencia, hubo una mayor sustitucion de especies en los ensamblajes de reptiles que en los de anfibios. Varias especies que se encontraron en el bosque maduro estuvieron ausentes en los bosques secundarios. Discutimos que la limitacion de la dispersion y las duras condiciones que prevalecen en los sitios abiertos y en los ambientes sucesionales tempranos impiden a las especies que habitan en el bosque maduro la colonizacion de esos habitats. Ademas, los periodos de barbecho corto y el aislamiento de los remanentes de bosques llevan a la formacion de nuevos ensambles dominados por especies favorecidas por las perturbaciones humanas.

AB Understanding factors that affect the persistence of charismatic megafauna in human-dominated landscapes is crucial to inform conservation decision-making and reduce human-wildlife conflict. We assessed the effect of environmental and anthropogenic factors at different landscape and management scales in predicting the distribution of African elephant (Loxodonta africana) within the Greater Mapungubwe Transfrontier Conservation Area in Southern Africa. We combined aerial distribution counts over a 12-yr period with 14 variables, representing food availability, landscape, and anthropogenic effects, into generalized linear models. Generalized linear models were run for the broader landscape, as well as three separate management units within the broader landscape, namely ecotourism, trophy hunting, and a combination of hunting and ecotourism. Human activities within different management units forced elephant to trade-off between disturbance avoidance, and good food and water availability. In addition, the important predictors of elephant distribution within each of the management units differed from the predictors at the broader landscape. Overall, our results suggest that at the fine scale, elephant are constraint by factors that may be masked at the broader landscape scale. We suggest that accounting for anthropogenic disturbance is important in determining the distribution of large, wide-ranging, mammal species in increasingly human-dominated landscapes, and that modeling needs to be done at the spatial scales at which conservation decisions are made.

AB Tropical alpine peatlands are important carbon reservoirs and are a critical component of local hydrological cycles. In high elevation peatlands slow decomposition rates result from a nutrient-poor substrate resistant to decay. The responses of paramo peatland ecosystems to increased nutrient additions and physical disturbance due to agricultural activities are unknown. Here, we conducted a two-year fertilization and physical disturbance experiment in a Sphagnumdominated peatland in the Central Andes of Colombia. We hypothesized that fertilization and physical disturbance will diminish the ability of the peat to store organic matter by increasing decomposition and that vascular plants will displace Sphagnum as the dominant plant group. We simulated cattle activity by adding manure as a fertilizer and physical disturbance as a proxy for cattle trampling. Species composition varied in proportion to the intensity of disturbance. Sphagnum cover was reduced under any disturbance treatment. Non-native grasses usually found in cattle pastures invaded treatments with fertilizer additions or physical disturbance. Overall aboveground plant biomass doubled in fertilized treatments, suggesting that plant biomass production was nutrient limited. Decomposition rates tripled in disturbed treatments as compared to controls. This reduces the ability of the peatland to store organic matter. Andean peatlands are prized ecological assets; however, our results show that the El Morro paramo peatland experienced increased decomposition rates over short time periods after small-scale disturbances. This created profound consequences for the ecological services offered by these peatlands.

AB Amazonian Dark Earths (ADE) are the result of human modification of the Amazonian landscape since pre-Columbian times. ADE are characterized by increased soil fertility compared to natural soils. In the Amazonian forest, soil fertility influences understory herb and fern species composition. However, little research has been done to evaluate the effect of ADE on the composition of the understory community. We evaluated the effects of ADE and soil in 36 plots (150mx4m) established in a Bolivian moist forest (La Chonta). For each plot, we determined soil nutrients, and the composition, richness, and abundance of terrestrial fern, angiosperm herb, and understory palm species. We found that the presence of ADE created a gradient in soil nutrients and pH that affected the understory species composition especially of ferns and palms. Additionally, the higher nutrient concentration and more neutral soil pH on ADE soils caused a decrease of ferns species richness. We therefore conclude that the current composition of the understory community in this particular Bolivian forest is a reflection of past human modifications of the soil.

AB Studies of biodiversity and terrestrial ecosystem functioning have concentrated almost exclusively on temperate grasslands. To broaden the reach of biodiversity-functioning research, five fast growing species, comprising three eudicot trees and two congeneric palms (none symbiotic with nitrogen-fixing microorganisms), were grown for 13yr in a replacement-series mixture and monocultures on a fertile soil in a high-rainfall area of lowland Costa Rica. The mixture accrued more biomass and had greater net productivity than the average, but not the most productive, monoculture. Relative Land Output (a measure of comparative yield) increased steeply. The combined evidence points to an increase in resource partitioning or facilitation among species over time. Spatial partitioning of aboveground space (for light capture) and soil (possibly for retrieval of deep nitrogen), and facilitation of phosphorus availability by one species, are mechanisms that may account for the inferred complementarity. Extending the generalized findings on biodiversity-productivity relationships from well-studied grasslands to tropical forests is warranted. Mixtures of fast growing trees can out-perform the average of their component monocultures, whether the metric is biomass accrual or productivity. The modular growth of long-lived structure enables arborescent species to retain crown space previously captured and may lead to increased spatial partitioning and facilitation of resources over time.

AB Understanding how changing precipitation patterns impact the population dynamics of Amazonian plants is necessary for predicting their long-term survival. Most terrestrial plants are characterized by life cycles intractably slow for evaluating such demographic consequences. Due to the demands of surviving on an ephemeral substrate such as a leaf surface, epiphyllous (leaf-inhabiting) bryophytes have some of the fastest generation times for terrestrial plants. Considering these advantages, we investigated the demographic consequences of seasonality in precipitation during one-year of the epiphyllous bryophyte Radula flaccida Gott. (Radulaceae) in a central Amazonian rain forest. In a 1-ha sized study area, 154 epiphyll colonies from 18 phorophytes of the understory shrub Naucleopsis ulei (Warb.) Ducke (Moraceae) were marked and colony growth, extinction, recolonization, as well as rates of sexual and asexual expression were measured in nine demographic censuses. The probability of survivorship decreased in the dry season due to the synergistic effects of both increased leaf fall (e.g., loss of occupied patches) and colony mortality on persisting leaves. Asexual expression also declined significantly during the driest months; however, sexual expression, as measured by sporophyte density, was not related to seasonality. Logistic regression probabilities also indicate a minimum threshold colony size for optimal sporophyte expression. Lower survivorship and colony growth in the dry season along with reduced sporophyte production in smaller colonies implies that both demographic stability as well as population structure of Amazonian epiphyll species may be compromised whether climate models projecting prolonged droughts for the region are accurate.

AB To design feasible conservation and management policies for wild species, it is critical to understand the effects of periodic disturbances, be they natural or anthropogenic. The Caribbean Basin is characterized by high cyclonic activity that has a strong impact on the demography and population dynamics of many taxa, including epiphytic orchids. We conducted a 5-yr study of rare ghost orchid demography, Dendrophylax lindenii, to assess the stability of a protected population of this species in Cuba. Using both stochastic and deterministic integral projection models, we found that mean annual population growth rates are negative (=0.975). However, we found both population growth rate and extinction risk are highly sensitive to survival rates and reproduction, a difficult to quantify rate for many orchids including our study species. While this species is fairly long-lived, its relatively slow increase in annual survival with increasing size may reflect the lack of a protected (i.e., subterranean) storage organa life-history trait that may typify other epiphytic species and increase susceptibility to disturbance events. Hurricanes, which are predicted to increase in frequency as a result of climate change, dramatically increase adult mortality. Simulations of these effects indicate that hurricanes and similar disturbances could result in near certain extinction in short time horizons (25yr) if their annual probability of occurrence exceeds 14percent. These results suggest a need to better quantify recruitment rates, as well as the sensitivity of population dynamics of this and other orchid species to hurricanes and other periodic disturbances.

AB Five sets of herbivore exclosures situated in mesic and semi-arid savannas in Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park, South Africa were used to investigate the effects of mammal browsers and savanna type on plant traits relating to leaf nutrient content, defense, and growth in seven Acacia species. Mostly, browsing did not significantly affect leaf nutrient content but for a few species (i.e., increasing foliar N and P, decreasing C/N, and total polyphenols). Browser effects on structural defenses tended to be more pronounced than for leaf nutrient content and chemical defenses, particularly for semi-arid species, resulting in longer, thicker, and denser spines, and a lower bite size index on browsed plants for most semi-arid species. Browsing had no significant effect on growth rates for all species. Secondly, we investigated the effect of savanna type (mesic vs. semi-arid) on the same set of plant traits and growth rates. A trade-off in defense strategy was evident where mesic species had lower quality leaves and invested more heavily in growth and chemical defenses, while semi-arid species generally had higher nutrient content leaves and invested more in structural defenses and higher levels of ramification. These findings suggest that the previously documented trade-off in plant growth, resprouting ability and architecture between herbivore versus fire-adapted savanna woody species can possibly be extended to include browse quality and defense type.

AB Communities of invertebrate animals in lower canopy and saxicolous tank bromeliads, originally studied in 1993-1997, were resampled along an elevational gradient in tabonuco, palo colorado, and dwarf or cloud forest in Puerto Rico in 2010. These Puerto Rican montane rain forests were impacted strongly by hurricanes in 1989 and 1998, so the surveys in the 1990s represented 4-8yr of post-hurricane recovery, whereas our recent survey represents 12yr of post-hurricane recovery. At most elevations, species diversity, both within individual bromeliads and at the forest scale, declined between the 1990s and 2010. This decline in diversity between decades is associated with reductions in bromeliad density as the canopy progressively closed during recovery from hurricane damage. The observed decline in alpha and gamma diversity appears to have involved the loss of rarer species, as might be expected from standard metapopulation theory. By contrast, the most common species were remarkably stable in abundance, composition, and frequency of occurrence over the two decades. In the lowermost tabonuco forest, two endemic bromeliad specialists, restricted to bromeliads for their entire life cycle, were not found on resampling. This study also demonstrates that, at least in Puerto Rico, sets of ten plants from each forest were sufficient to monitor bromeliad invertebrate populations and their diversity over time.

AB How species with similar ecological requirements avoid competitive exclusion remains contentious, especially in the species-rich tropics. Niche differentiation has been proposed as a major mechanism for species coexistence. However, different niche dimensions must be studied simultaneously to assess their combined effects on diversity and composition of a community. In most terrestrial ecosystems, ants are among the most abundant and ubiquitous animals. Since they display direct, aggressive competition and often competitively displace subordinate species from resources, niche differentiation may be especially relevant among ants. We studied temporal and trophic niche differentiation in a ground ant community in a forest fragment in French Guiana. Different baits were presented during day and night to assess the temporal and dietary niches of the local species. They represented natural food resources such as sugars, carrion, excrements, seeds, and live prey. In addition, pitfalls provided a background measure of ant diversity. The communities attracted to the different baits significantly differed from each other, and even less attractive baits yielded additional species. We detected species specialized on living grasshoppers, sucrose, seeds, or dead insects. Community-level differences between day and night were larger than those between baits, and many species were temporally specialized. In contrast to commonness, foraging efficiency of species was correlated to food specialization. We conclude that many ant species occupy different temporal or dietary niches. However, for many generalized species, the dietary, and temporal niche differentiation brought forward through our sampling effort, cannot alone explain their coexistence.

AB Most animals have complex life histories, composed of a series of ecologically distinct stages, and the transitions between stages are often plastic. Anurans are models for research on complex life cycles. Many species exhibit plastic timing of and size at metamorphosis, due to both environmental constraints on larval growth and development and adaptive plastic responses to environmental variation. Models predicting optimal timing of metamorphosis balance cost/benefit ratios across stages, assuming that size affects growth and mortality rates in each stage. Much research has documented such effects in the larval period, but we lack an equal understanding of juvenile growth and mortality. Here, we examine how variation in size at metamorphosis in the Neotropical red-eyed treefrog, Agalychnis callidryas, affects post-metamorphic growth, foraging, and behavior in the lab as well as growth and survival in the field. Surprisingly, many individuals lost mass for weeks after metamorphosis. In the lab, larger metamorphs lost more mass following metamorphosis, ate similar amounts, had lower food conversion efficiencies, and grew more slowly after mass loss ceased than did smaller ones. In field cages larger metamorphs were more likely to survive than smaller ones; just one froglet died in the lab. Our data suggest that size-specific differences in physiology and behavior influence these trends. Comparing across species and studies, large size at metamorphosis generally confers higher survival; size effects on growth rates vary substantially among species, in both magnitude and direction, but may be stronger in the tropics.

AB Tadpoles have diverse morphologies and occupy diverse habitats. The morphological differences between tadpoles can be represented by linear and geometric measurements and used to explain the organization of tadpole assemblages. However, the effects of evolutionary history must be isolated from the morphological differences before we can determine which patterns result from the use and sharing of common ecological resources. Here, we aimed to determine how morphological similarities and phylogenetic distances affect microhabitat choice by tadpoles. We analyzed the tadpoles of 101 anuran species and classified them according to ecomorphological guild, habitat use, position in the water column, and floor substrate. We used geometric and traditional morphometric approaches to describe the morphological variation among tadpoles and calculated the patristic distance for each species. Afterwards, we used morphometric and phylogenetic matrices as predictors of the variance in the ecological matrix, using a partial redundancy analysis. When we used traditional morphometric data, phylogeny explained a large amount of the ecological variation. By contrast, when we used geometric morphometric data, morphology and phylogeny explained similar amounts of the ecological variation, showing that the technique used to extract morphological variation affects the results. We provide evidence that both morphology, as a surrogate for contemporary factors, and evolutionary inertia are important in determining the behavior of tadpoles. Thus, niche conservatism can be important in modeling the behavior of tadpoles, but does not explain all the preferences of tadpoles.

AB Large areas of tropical moist forests have been converted to cattle pastures, generating complex landscapes where different habitats are represented by small patches with an uneven spatial distribution. Here, we describe how bird communities respond to the different elements present in a livestock landscape that was originally dominated by tropical moist forest. We surveyed six habitats: open pastures, pastures with shrubs, early- and middle-secondary forests, mature forest, and pastures invaded by bracken ferns (Pteridium aquilinum). Bird diversity was high in secondary and mature forests, and low in fern-invaded sites and open pastures. Fern-dominated sites had the lowest bird species richness, and trophic guild diversity of all habitats. Habitat structure affected both bird species richness and densities in similar ways. Tree species richness was the habitat attribute that had a bigger positive effect on bird species richness. Bird community structure varied among sampled habitats, separating habitats in two major groups (forests and pastures). Our data indicate that bracken fern-invaded pastures were the worst habitat condition for avian communities. To increase bird diversity, we recommend to eliminate or manage bracken fern and to increase shrub and tree cover in open pastures to provide food resources and shelter for birds. Finally, we encourage the maintenance of secondary and mature forest remnants as a strategy to conserve resident birds within a landscape dominated by livestock activities.

AB The distribution of resources and food selection are fundamental to the ecology, life history, physiology, population dynamics, and conservation of animals. Introduced plants are changing foraging dynamics of herbivores in many ecosystems often with unknown consequences. Galapagos tortoises, like many herbivores, undertake migrations along elevation gradients driven by variability in vegetation productivity which take them into upland areas dominated by introduced plants. We sought to characterize diet composition of two species of Galapagos tortoises, focussing on how the role of introduced forage species changes over space and the implications for tortoise conservation. We quantified the distribution of tortoises with elevation using GPS telemetry. Along the elevation gradient, we quantified the abundance of introduced and native plant species, estimated diet composition by recording foods consumed by tortoises, and assessed tortoise physical condition from body weights and blood parameter values. Tortoises ranged between 0 and 429m in elevation over which they consumed at least 64 plant species from 26 families, 44 percent of which were introduced species. Cover of introduced species and the proportion of introduced species in tortoise diets increased with elevation. Introduced species were positively selected for by tortoises at all elevations. Tortoise physical condition was either consistent or increased with elevation at the least biologically productive season on Galapagos. Santa Cruz tortoises are generalist herbivores that have adapted their feeding behavior to consume many introduced plant species that has likely made a positive contribution to tortoise nutrition. Some transformed habitats that contain an abundance of introduced forage species are compatible with tortoise conservation.

AB Biogeographical history and current ecological interactions have usually been addressed separately to explain the spatial distribution of patterns of biodiversity. In this study, we evaluated the integrated effects of biogeographical and environmental factors in structuring the diurnal amphibian anuran assemblages of the upper Madeira River, southwestern Amazonia. We used a sampling design involving 98 standardized units, distributed across seven locations covering both banks of the river's course in the state of Rondonia, Brazil. We conducted searches for frogs in three campaigns between February 2010 and February 2011, aiming to: (1) evaluate the effect of the Madeira River as a biogeographic barrier at the species-assemblage level, and (2) test the influence of seven environmental variables (vegetation structure, vegetation cover, soil nutrients, soil structure, slope, elevation, and distance from the river bank) on the spatial structure of the frog assemblages, separately on each riverbank. Thirteen species of diurnal frogs were recorded, six of which were restricted to one of the river margins. Multivariate analysis of variance indicated a significant effect of the river as a barrier. Multiple regression analyses suggested that the environmental variables structuring frog assemblages differ on either side of the river. We found that both historical elements (on a regional scale) and environmental factors (at a local scale) shaped the occurrence and distribution of frog species in the study area.

AB A global data set on forest cover change was recently published and made freely available for use (Hansen etal. 2013. Science 342: 850-853). Although this data set has been criticized for inaccuracies in distinguishing vegetation types at the local scale, it remains a valuable source of forest cover information for areas where local data is severely lacking. Masoala National Park, in northeastern Madagascar, is an example of a region for which very little spatially explicit forest cover information is available. Yet, this extremely diverse tropical humid forest is undergoing a dramatic rate of forest degradation and deforestation through illegal selective logging of rosewood and ebony, slash-and-burn agriculture, and damage due to cyclones. All of these processes result in relatively diffuse and small-scale changes in forest cover. In this paper, we examine to what extent Hansen etal.'s global forestchange data set captures forest loss within Masoala National Park by comparing its performance to a locally calibrated, object-oriented classification approach. We verify both types of classification with substantial ground truthing. We find that both the global and local classifications perform reasonably well in detecting small-scale slash-and-burn agriculture, but neither performs adequately in detecting selective logging. We conclude that since the use of the global forest change data set requires very little technical and financial investment, and performs almost as well as the more resource-demanding, locally calibrated classification, it may be advantageous to use the global forest change data set even for local conservation purposes.

AB The ant-plant Humboldtia brunonis secretes extrafloral nectar (EFN) despite the lack of antiherbivore protection from most ants. EFN was richer in composition than phloem sap and honeydew from untended Hemiptera on the plant, suggesting that EFN could potentially distract ants from honeydew, since ants rarely tended Hemiptera on this plant.

AB The tropical forests of the Congo Basin and Gulf of Guinea harbor some of the greatest terrestrial and aquatic biological diversity in the world. However, our knowledge of the rich biological diversity of this region and the evolutionary processes that have shaped it remains limited, as is our understanding of the capacity for species to adapt or otherwise respond to current and projected environmental change. In this regard, research efforts are needed to increase current scientific knowledge of this region's biodiversity, identify the drivers of past diversification, evaluate the potential for species to adapt to environmental change and identify key populations for future conservation. Moreover, when evolutionary research is combined with ongoing environmental monitoring efforts, it can also provide an important set of tools for assessing and mitigating the impacts of development activities. Building on a set of recommendations developed at an international workshop held in Gabon in 2011, we highlight major areas for future evolutionary research that could be directly tied to conservation priorities for the region. These research priorities are centered around five disciplinary themes: (1) documenting and discovering biodiversity; (2) identifying drivers of evolutionary diversification; (3) monitoring environmental change; (4) understanding community and ecosystem level processes; (5) investigating the ecology and epidemiology of disease from an evolutionary perspective (evolutionary epidemiology). Furthermore, we also provide an overview of the needs and priorities for biodiversity education and training in Central Africa.
   Resume Les forets tropicales du bassin du Congo et du Golfe de Guinee abritent une grande partie de la diversite terrestre et aquatique dans le monde. Pourtant, notre connaissance de la riche diversite biologique de cette region et les processus evolutifs qui l'ont faconnee demeurent encore peu compris, tout comme notre comprehension de la capacite des especes a s'adapter ou a repondre aux changements environnementaux actuels et a venir. De ce fait, des efforts de recherche sont necessaires pour ameliorer les connaissances scientifiques actuelles sur la biodiversite de cette region, determiner les causes des processus de diversifications passees, evaluer le potentiel des especes a repondre aux changements environnementaux et identifier les populations cles pour la conservation dans le futur. Par ailleurs, lorsque la recherche dans le domaine de l'evolution est combinee aux efforts de suivi continu de l'environnement, elle peut aussi fournir un ensemble d'outils importants pour l'evaluation et l'attenuation des impacts des activites de developpement. S'appuyant sur une serie de recommandations elaborees lors de l'atelier international qui s'est tenu au Gabon en 2011, nous soulignons les axes majeurs pour la recherche future dans le domaine de l'evolution qui pourraient etre lies directement aux priorites de la conservation dans la region. Ces priorites de recherche s'articulent autour de cinq thematiques: (1) l'inventaire et la decouverte de la biodiversite; (2) l'identification des causes de la diversification; (3) le suivi des changements environnementaux; (4) la comprehension des processus au niveau des communautes et des ecosystemes; (5) l'etude ecologique et epidemiologique des maladies d'un point de vue evolutif (epidemiologie evolutive). Toutefois, nous donnons egalement un apercu des besoins et des priorites en matiere d'education et de formation dans le domaine de la biodiversite en Afrique centrale.

   Patches: the Case of Pteridium aquilinum in a Neotropical Rain Forest

AB Deforestation and agricultural land degradation in tropical regions can create conditions for growth of perennial plant species forming mono-dominated patches (MDP). Such species might limit forest regeneration, and their proliferation forces the abandonment of fields and subsequent deforestation to establish new fields. Therefore, identifying factors fostering MDP species is critical for biodiversity conservation in human-modified landscapes. Here, we propose a conceptual framework to identify such factors and apply it to the case of Pteridium aquilinum (bracken fern), a light-demanding species, tolerant of low soil fertility and fire. We hypothesize that bracken proliferation is promoted by land-use changes that increase light availability, especially in sites with low soil fertility and land uses involving fire. We assessed this idea using agricultural fields in southeastern Mexico with different land-use change histories and quantifying prevalence and cover of bracken. Five different land-use change histories resulted from transitions among forest, crop, pasture, and fallow field stages. Of the 133 fields sampled, 71 percent had P.aquilinum; regression tree analysis indicated that 65 percent of inter-field variation in prevalence and 90 percent in cover was explained by land-use change history and soil type. Maximum prevalence, cover, and rates of increase in bracken were found on fields with low fertility sandy/clay soils, which had been used for crops and pasture, were frequently burned, and had high levels of light. Fields on fertile alluvial soil never used for pasture were bracken-free. Agriculture promoting high light environments on less fertile soils is a major cause of bracken proliferation and likely that of other MDP species.
   Abstracto En regiones tropicales, la deforestacion y la degradacion de campos agricolas puede crear las condiciones para el crecimiento de plantas perennes formadoras de parches mono-dominados. Tales especies pueden limitar la regeneracion del bosque y su proliferacion conlleva el abandono de los campos agricolas y genera subsecuente deforestacion debido al establecimiento de nuevos campos agricolas. Por lo tanto, identificar los factores que promueven especies formadoras de parches mono-dominados es critico para la conservacion de la biodiversidad en paisajes dominados por el humano. En este articulo se propone un marco conceptual para identificar tales factores y lo aplicamos al caso del helecho Pteridium aquilinum (petatilla), una especie demandante de luz, tolerante a la baja fertilidad del suelo y al fuego. Hipotetizamos que la proliferacion de P.aquilinum es promovida por cambios en el uso del suelo que incrementan la disponibilidad de luz, especialmente en sitios con baja fertilidad del suelo y que incluyen el uso de fuego. Evaluamos esta idea mediante el uso de campos agricolas con diferentes historias de cambio de uso del suelo y cuantificamos la prevalencia y la cobertura de P.aquilinum en el sureste de Mexico. Cinco diferente historias de cambio de uso de suelo resultaron de la transicion entre bosque, agricultura, pastizales y sitios abandonados. De los 133 campos muestreados, 71% presentaron P.aquilinum. Un analisis de arbol de regresion indico que para la prevalencia y la cobertura, el 65% y 90% de la variacion entre campos, respectivamente fue explicada por la historia de cambios de uso de suelo y el tipo de suelo. La maxima prevalencia, la cobertura y las tasas de incremento de P.aquilinum se encontraron en campos con baja fertilidad tales como suelos arenosos y arcillosos, que se utilizaron para agricultura y pastizales y que fueron frecuentemente quemados y con alta disponibilidad de luz. Campos en suelos aluviales que representan suelo fertiles y que nunca se utilizaron como pastizales estuvieron libres de P.aquilinum. Las historias de uso de suelo que promueven ambientes de alta disponibilidad de luz en suelo fertiles son una causa mayor de la proliferacion de P.aquilinum y probablemente de otras plantas perennes que forman parches dominados por una sola especie.

AB Continental tropical forests are thought to be resistant to alien plant invasion due to a lack of disturbance, or low propagule pressure from introduced species. We assessed the importance of disturbance and edge effects by surveying areas of submontane and lowland forest of Amani Nature Reserve in the East Usambara mountains, Tanzania. These areas are in the vicinity of Amani Botanic Garden (ABG)a propagule source for many alien plant species. We surveyed three edges in the vicinity of the ABG plantations, using plots interspersed along multiple 250m transects. Survey plots were either in secondary or seminatural forest, representing a difference in past disturbance). Alien plant species richness and abundance declined with increasing distance from forest edges, indicating that edge effects were important. In addition, the effect of distance on richness and abundance of alien species as adults was much smaller in seminatural than secondary forest, emphasizing that invasion of seminatural forest is less likely to occur. Abundance and occurrence of individual species showed broadly similar declines with increasing distance from the forest edge, and lower abundance in seminatural compared to secondary forest. Alien species were dominant in 15 percent of plots surveyed. As 28 percent of the Amani nature reserve forest is within 250m of an edge, the importance of disturbance and edges could make a potentially large proportion of the forest vulnerable to alien species invasion.
   Muhtasari Misitu ya ukanda wa kitropiki ina uwezo mkubwa wa kustahimili mashambulizi kutoka kwa mimea isiyo na asili ya eneo hilo. Hii inatokana na kutokuwepo kwa usumbufu unaoletwa na mimea hiyo isiyo asili. Tulitathmini mabadiliko yatokanayo na athari za mimea isiyo na asili ya eneo la kitropiki katika misitu yenye asili hiyo kwenye hifadhi ya Amani. Amani ipo mashariki mwa milima ya Usambara nchini Tanzania karibu na bustani ya mimea ambapo majaribio ya mimea mingi isiyo na asili ya kitropiki hufanyika. Tulichunguza athari ya mabadiliko kwa kugawanya mashamba ya bustani ya mimea Amani katika ukubwa wa mita 250. Mashamba ya kuchunguzia yalikua ama katika hali isiyo ya asili ama hali ya nusu asili (kuwakilisha tofauti katika mabadiliko ya awali). Mimea isiyo na asili ya kitropiki ilipungua kwa idadi na ustawi kutegemeana na umbali wake kutoka ilipo misitu ya asili, kuashiria umuhimu wa athari za mabadiliko. Pia athari ya umbali katika idadi na ustawi wa mimea isiyo ya asili ilikua ndogo katika misitu ya hali ya nusu asili ukilinganisha na misitu isiyo ya asili, kudhihirisha kuwa mashambulizi si rahisi kutokea katika misitu ya nusu asili. Mabadiliko katika wingi na ustawi wa mimea na upungufu wake unategemea umbali toka misitu ya asili na aina ya misitu kama ni nusu asili ikilinganishwa na misitu isiyo ya asili. Mimea isiyo ya asili ilistawi kwa asilimia 15 katika mashamba ambayo uchunguzi ulifanyika. Kwa kuwa asilimia 28 ya hifadhi ya msitu wa Amani iko ndani ya mita 250 za eneo la tathmini, athari za mabadiliko zinaweza kupelekea msitu wa Amani kushambuliwa na mimea hiyo isiyo ya asili.

AB Chronosequences, commonly used to assess succession, have been questioned because of their failure to project successional trajectories. Here, we develop a simple analytical approach combining both chronosequence and dynamic data to test the power of age of abandonment and site factors to explain and predict succession. The approach proceeds by first fitting statistical models relating age to attribute values (the chronosequence model) and their observed changes (the dynamic model) to test explanatory power. Predictive power is then tested by bootstrapping the chronosequence model to derive confidence intervals for expected changes and comparing them with the dynamic model. Finally, residuals from both models are tested against site factors. The procedure was applied to six attributes (basal area, plant density, mean plant height, species richness, evenness, and composition) of the woody community (plants >1cm dbh within 0.1-ha plots) in nine abandoned cattle pastures (0-12yr) and three old growth tropical dry forests monitored over 6yr. Age explained 60-97 percent of the variance in community attributes and only 32-57 percent in observed changes. It significantly overestimated basal area and mean height, while species richness and composition were highly predicted. Besides age, management history also explained successional dynamics. Our results suggest age is not necessarily a reliable predictor of short-term successional dynamics, and explanatory power is not indicative of predictive power. Because of this low reliability, caution is needed when applying chronosequences to evaluate ecosystem services' recovery. The analytical approach developed here contributes to a better exploration of those possible limitations.
   Resumen El uso de la cronosecuencia como herramienta para conocer la sucesion ha sido cuestionado debido a la incapacidad de esta para predecir las trayectorias sucesionales. En este estudio se presenta una aproximacion analitica sencilla que combina la informacion de cronosecuencia con informacion dinamica obtenida de mediciones repetidas en el tiempo, para poner a prueba la capacidad de la edad de abandono y de los factores de sitio para explicar y predecir la sucesion. El primer paso consiste en el ajuste de modelos estadisticos que relacionan la edad de abandono con atributos del ecosistema (modelo de cronosecuencia) o con los cambios observados en dichos atributos a traves del tiempo (modelo de la dinamica), lo que permite poner a prueba la capacidad explicativa de la edad de abandono. Aplicando un muestreo con remplazamiento a los datos del modelo de cronosecuencia (bootstrapping) se derivan los intervalos de confianza para los cambios esperados a partir del mismo. La capacidad predictiva del modelo de cronosecuencia se somete a prueba mediante la comparacion de dichos intervalos con el modelo dinamico. Finalmente, el efecto de los factores de sitio se pone a prueba relacionando estos ultimos con los residuales de ambos modelos. Este procedimiento se aplico al analisis de seis atributos (area basal, densidad, altura promedio, riqueza de especies, equitatividad y composicion) de la comunidad de plantas lenosas (plantas >1cm de diametro a la altura del pecho al interior de parcelas de 0.1-ha) en nueve potreros abandonados (0-12 anos de abandono) y tres bosques maduros ubicados en una tropical estacionalmente seca y que fueron monitoreados durante 6 anos. La edad explico 60-97 por ciento de la varianza en los atributos de la comunidad, pero solo 32-57 por ciento para los cambios observados. La edad sobreestimo de manera significativa los cambios en area basal y altura promedio, mientras que los cambios en riqueza y composicion de especies fueron adecuadamente predichos. La historia de manejo tambien explico los cambios observados en los atributos. Nuestros resultados sugieren que la edad no es necesariamente un predictor confiable de los cambios sucesionales en periodos cortos de tiempo y que la capacidad explicativa de los modelos no indica su poder predictivo. Debido a esta baja confiabilidad, la aplicacion de los modelos de cronosecuencia en la prediccion de la recuperacion de los servicios ecosistemicos a traves de la sucesion debe hacerse con cautela. La aproximacion analitica desarrollada en el presente estudio contribuye a la exploracion de dichas limitantes de las cronosecuencias.

AB Niche diversification is prominent among the mechanisms proposed to explain tropical rain forest tree diversity, with many studies focusing on trade-offs among shade tolerance and growth. Less obvious is the impact of occasional, ephemeral and often minor disturbances on tree seedling survival. We propose that differential tolerances to soil waterlogging can contribute to the distribution of tree seedling communities along microtopographical gradients. We test this hypothesis experimentally by evaluating survival and performance of planted seedlings across microtopographical gradients in a periodically inundated tropical rain forest environment. Survival and relative growth rates were assessed for six Shorea (Dipterocarpaceae) species in Sepilok Forest Reserve (Sabah, Malaysia) over a 2-yr period, during which seedlings were subjected to two brief flooding events. The species were selected on the basis of soil habitat affinities, with two species being primarily associated with low-lying alluvial flats subject to inundation, two being associated with non-flooded mudstone hills, and two species occurring in both habitats. Seedling performance was related to microtopographic elevation within and among plots and to soil moisture among plots. The faster growing species, Shorea argentifolia, Shorea leprosula and Shorea parvifolia, tended to be more vulnerable to high soil moisture in terms of mortality than the three species with lower growth rates. Within plots, soil moisture was inversely correlated with microelevation, and seedlings located at higher microelevations had an increased probability of survival. Microtopographical differences in seedling position could therefore contribute to species assembly processes through differential mortality, particularly in areas subject to minor and ephemeral flooding events.
   Abstrak Kepelbagaian nic adalah di antara cadangan mekanisme yang menonjol untuk menerangkan kepelbagaian pokok tropika hutan hujan di mana kebanyakan kajian memberi tumpuan kepada keseimbangan di antara toleransi keadaan teduh dan pertumbuhan. Bagaimanapun, kesan gangguan yang mempengaruhi kemandirian anak pokok yang berlaku secara sekali-sekala, tidak kekal dan berkeamatan rendah masih kurang jelas. Kami mencadangkan bahawa perbezaan toleransi akibat kelimpahan air atas tanah semasa banjir boleh menyumbang kepada pengagihan komuniti anak pokok di sepanjang cerun mickrotopografi mukabumi. Kami menguji hipotesis ini dengan menilai kemandirian dan prestasi tumbesaran anak benih yang ditanam di sepanjang cerun mickrotopografi mukabumi di persekitaran hutan hujan tropika yang kadangkala tanahnya dilimpah oleh air banjir. Kemandirian dan kadar pertumbuhan relatif anak-anak pokok dinilai untuk enam spesies Shorea (Dipterocarpaceae) di Hutan Simpan Sepilok (Sabah, Malaysia) dalam tempoh dua tahun, di mana anak pokok tersebut terdedah kepada dua peristiwa banjir yang singkat. Spesies dipilih mengikut persamaan habitat tanah, di mana dua spesies dijumpai berasosiasi di tanah rendah aluvium yang kadang kala dilanda banjir, dan dua spesies lagi dijumpai di bukit batu lumpur yang tidak dibanjiri. Manakala dua spesies dijumpai di kedua-dua habitat. Prestasi tumbesaran anak pokok di dalam dan di antara plot dipengaruhi oleh ketinggian mukabumi, manakala pengaruh kelembapan tanah hanya didapati di antara plot. Dari segi kematian anak pokok, kelembapan tanah yang tinggi lebih memberi impak kepada spesies yang mempunyai kadar tumbesaran yang tinggi seperti Shorea argentifolia, Shorea leprosula dan Shorea parvifolia berbanding dengan daripada tiga spesies yang mempunyai kadar tumbesaran yang lebih rendah. Dalam plot, kelembapan tanah menunjukkan kaitan kadar songsang dengan ketinggian mikrotopografi mukabumi, dan anak pokok yang terletak di tanah lebih tinggi mempunyai kebarangkalian peningkatan daya hidup yang tinggi. Oleh yang demikian, perbezaan mikrotopografi dalam kedudukan anak pokok boleh mempengaruhi proses pengkelompokan spesies melalui ciri-ciri kematian yang berbeza, terutamanya di kawasan terdedah kepada peristiwa banjir kecil dan tidak kekal.

AB Clonal propagation becomes more abundant with increasing altitudes as environmental conditions worsen. To date, little attention has been paid to the way in which clonal propagation affects genetic diversity and the fine-scale spatial genetic structure (FSGS) of clonal alpine trees. An AFLP study was undertaken to quantify the clonal and genetic diversity and FSGS of the vulnerable treeline species Polylepis reticulata in Ecuador. We successfully genotyped 32 and 75 ramets within 4mx100m (coarse scale) and 4mx4m (fine scale) transects of one population, respectively. Higher genotypic diversity was detected at the coarse scale than at the fine scale, while lower genetic diversity was detected for P.reticulata than other Polylepis spp. at both scales. Significantly stronger FSGS was detected at the ramet level than the genet level for P.reticulata within a spatial distance of 3m. The studied P.reticulata population showed pronounced FSGS (Sp=0.012 at the genet level, a statistic reflecting declining pairwise kinship with distance) revealed restricted gene dispersal, which implies restricted seed dispersal for this population, assuming pollen flow is as extensive as that described for other wind-pollinated tree species. Our results revealed that clonal diversity is a function of both sample size and the spatial scale of the sampling area. The findings highlights that clonal propagation has affected FSGS within a spatial distance of 3m for this species.
   Resumen La propagacion clonal es mas frecuente con el aumento de la altitud conforme las condiciones ambientales empeoran. Hasta la fecha, pocos estudios se han enfocado en la forma en que la propagacion clonal afecta la diversidad genetica y la estructura genetica a escala fina (FSGS) de arboles andinos con propagacion clonal. Se realizo un estudio de AFLP para cuantificar la diversidad clonal y genetica y la FSGS de Polylepis reticulata, una especie vulnerable del limite boscoso en Ecuador. Determinamos el genotipo de una poblacion con 32 ramets en transectos de 4x100m (escala grande), y 75 ramets en transectos de 4x4m (escala fina). La diversidad genotipica fue mayor a escala grande que a escala fina. P.reticulata mostro menor diversidad genetica que otras especies de Polylepis a ambas escalas. Se detecto mayor FSGS al nivel de ramets que a nivel de genets para P.reticulata en una distancia espacial de 3m. La poblacion de P.reticulata estudiada mostro una pronunciada FSGS (Sp = 0.012 a nivel de genet, una estadistica reflejando una disminucion en pairwise kinship con la distancia), revelando una dispersion genetica restringida; lo que implica la restriccion en la dispersion de semillas para esta poblacion, asumiendo que el flujo de polen sea tan grande como el descrito para otras especies de arboles polinizados por viento. Nuestros resultados revelan que la diversidad clonal esta en funcion del tamano de muestra y la escala espacial del area de muestreo. Los resultados resaltan que la propagacion clonal ha afectado la FSGS dentro los 3m de distancia para esta especie.

AB The frequency of extreme precipitation events is predicted to increase in some tropical regions in response to global climate change, but the impacts of this form of disturbance on the structure and dynamics of tropical tree communities across heterogeneous landscapes remain understudied. We determined the effects of an extreme precipitation event (EPE) in July 2006 on mortality of dipterocarps on a 68ha permanent inventory plot in Sepilok Forest Reserve, Sabah. For stems 30cm dbh, 12 of the 15 species of Dipterocarpaceae on this plot have significant positive and/or negative associations to habitats defined by topography and soil type. Short-term mortality induced by the EPE was much greater for individuals growing on the alluvial floodplain (13.7%) than in the mudstone (1.4%) or sandstone (0.0%) habitats, but mortality of dipterocarps did not differ among these habitats in the subsequent 5-yr interval. The likelihood of mortality in response to the EPE was highest for a small group of fast growing dipterocarps that possess low wood density and a strong association to the alluvial forest habitat. This group of species represents a high percentage of dipterocarp individuals but a low proportion of dipterocarp diversity in this habitat. We conclude that disturbance induced by high rainfall events contributes to the episodic nature of tropical forest dynamics, and that increases in the frequency of these events would disproportionately impact low-lying alluvial forest environments and some of the species growing in them.
   Malay Kekerapan kejadian hujan di kawasan tropika telah diramal akan semakin bertambah, disebab oleh perubahan iklim dunia. Pada masa ini, kesan kejadian hujan yang bertambah kerap terhadap struktur serta dinamik hutan tropika di pelbagai landskap masih kurang diketahui. Penyelidikan telah dibuat untuk menyiasat kesan kejadian hujan kerap pada 2006 terhadap kadar pertumbuhan Dipterokap yang mempunyai dbh melebihi 30cm terletak dalam plot 68ha di dalam Hutan Simpan Sepilok Kabili di Sabah. Penyelidikan menunjukkan 12 daripada 15 spesis yang dikaji mempunyai kaitan positif dan/atau negative yang ketara terhadap topografi serta jenis tanah yang didapati di habitat tersebut. Didapati kadar mortality adalah tinggi untuk individu yang bertumbuh di tanah alluvial (13.7%), jika dibanding dengan individu yang bertumbuh di tanah lumpur (1.4%) dan tanah pasir (0.0%). Walaubagaimanapun, kadar mortality adalah tidak banyak berbeza antara individu yang bertumbih di jenis tanah berlainan apabila kajian diulangi 5 tahun kemudian. Adalah didapati juga, tindak balas terhadap kejadian hujan yang kerap adalah terhad kepada beberapa jenis Dipterokap yang bertumbuh cepat, mempunyai kepadatan kayu yang rendah dan yang terletak di tanah alluvial sahaja. Kesimpulannya, kekerapan kejadian hujan sebegini akan mempengaruhi kadar pertumbuhan spesis pokok yang bertumbuh di hutan bertanah alluvial.

AB Seed dispersal studies have primarily examined dispersal as a function of distance from the parent tree and/or heterogeneity in dispersal due to animal use of nesting, roosting and sleeping sites. However, non-random heterogeneity in seed dispersal is also likely to result from the post-foraging behavior and movement of frugivores which prefer certain trees. To characterize variation in seed rain at fine scales, we studied the dispersal curve of Prunus ceylanica, a primarily bird-dispersed species. We compared seed rain at conspecifics, heterospecific fruiting trees with similar frugivore assemblages, emergent trees, and the landscape surrounding these trees. Seed rain of P.ceylanica was found to peak globally under the canopy of conspecifics but to peak locally under the canopy and immediate neighborhood of heterospecific fruiting trees. Our results demonstrate that seed rain is highly clumped even at fine spatial scales. A large proportion of seeds are dispersed in specific, localized regions. This variation can have important implications for plant population dynamics and might significantly alter the impact of post-dispersal processes. Seed dispersal models may need to incorporate this heterogeneity to explain manifestations of spatially explicit dynamics like mixed species orchards'.

AB Understanding the ecological interactions between plant reproductive strategies and frugivore feeding behavior can offer insight into the maintenance of tropical forest biodiversity. We examined the role of plant ecological and phenological characteristics in influencing fruit consumption by the White-bearded gibbon (Hylobates albibarbis) in Gunung Palung National Park, Indonesian Borneo. Gibbons are widespread across Borneo, highly frugivorous and perform important seed dispersal services. We compare multiple models using information criteria to identify the ecological and phenological predictors that most strongly influence gibbon fruit use of 154 plant genera. The most important predictors of resource use were the overall abundance of a genus and the consistency of fruit availability. Plant genera can maintain constant fruit availability as a result of (1) individual stems fruiting often or (2) stems fruiting out of synchrony with each other (asynchrony). Our results demonstrate that gibbons prefer to feed on plant genera that provide consistent fruit availability due to fruiting asynchrony. Because gibbons feed more often on genera that fruit asynchronously, gibbons are more likely to disperse seeds of plant genera with this reproductive strategy. Research on other frugivorous species is needed to determine whether the results for gibbons are generalizable more broadly. Finally, these results suggest that asynchronously fruiting plant genera may be particularly important for habitat restoration in tropical forests designed for frugivore conservation.
   Ringkasan Pemahaman mengenai hubungan interaksi ekologi antara strategi reproduksi tumbuhan dan perilaku makan satwa frugivore (pemakan buah) dapat memberikan pengetahuan lebih mendalam untuk pelestarian keanekargaman hayati hutan tropis. Di dalam studi ini, kami meneliti bagaimana peran karakteristik ekologi dan fenologi pada tumbuhan dapat memengaruhi konsumsi buah oleh Kelampiau berjanggut putih (Hylobates albibarbis) di Taman Nasional Gunung Palung, Kalimantan Barat, Indonesia. Kelampiau tersebar luas di seluruh Kalimantan, satwa yang sangat frugivorous dan memiliki peran penting dalam penyebaran biji. Kami membandingkan beberapa model dengan menggunakan kriteria informasi untuk mengidentifikasikan beberapa prediksi ekologi dan fenologi yang paling kuat dalam memengaruhi makanan buah Kelampiau dengan menggunakan 154 jenis tumbuhan. Sumber prediksi yang paling penting digunakan yaitu pada saat melimpahnya ketersediaan buah yang terjadi secara menyeluruh dan konsisten. Jenis tumbuhan dapat mempertahankan ketersediaan buahnya secara konstan sebagai hasil dari 1) individu yang sering berbuah atau 2) batang pada individu yang berbuah diwaktu yang berbeda dengan individu lain dari jenis yang sama (asynchrony). Hasil kami menunjukkan bahwa Kelampiau lebih memilih makan dari jenis tumbuhan yang menyediakan buah secara konsisten, karena adanya asynchrony antar individu di dalam jenisnya. Dikarenakan Kelampiau lebih sering makan dari jenis buah dengan karakteristik asynchrony, maka Kelampiau lebih memungkinkan melakukan penyebaran biji dengan strategi reproduksi tersebut. Penelitian pada spesies frugivorous lainnya diperlukan untuk dapat menentukan apakah hasil dari Kelampiau dapat digeneralisasikan lebih luas lagi. Pada akhirnya, hasil penelitian ini dapat menunjukkan bahwa jenis tumbuhan dengan karakteristik asynchrony mungkin sangat penting untuk pemulihan habitat di hutan tropis yang dikelola untuk konservasi frugivore.

AB Ants have been shown as particularly affected by land disturbance through deforestation and conversion of forest to agriculture. The effect of land use change on ant diversity in the Congo Basin is not well known. We conducted intensive sampling along a gradient of increasing vegetation disturbance to test the effect of habitat disturbance on ant diversity and Functional Groups composition. Sampling was conducted in 30 plots (5 study sites x 3 habitat x 2 plots/habitat), replicated six times in 1year. In each plot, ants were monitored with pitfall traps, quadrats and baits. We recorded 237 ant morphospecies grouped in 10 subfamilies and 43 genera. Myrmicaria opaciventris was the most abundant species followed by Anoplolepis tenella. Forest had greater ant diversity compared with fallows and mixed-crop fields. Functional groups were dominated by Opportunists, followed by Omnivorous Arboreal Dominants and Generalized Mymicinae. Their composition was not affected by the disturbance, but occurrence of Specialist Predators decreased with increasing disturbance. Occurrence of Generalized Myrmicinae, Opportunists and Subordinate Camponotini increased with disturbance. These results indicate that forest conversion into mixed-crop fields reduce ant diversity. It can also increase abundance of species with generalized diet that predominates where stress and disturbance limits other ants.

AB Group size affects many aspects of the ecology and social organization of animals. We investigated group size stability for five primate species in Kibale National Park, Uganda from 1996 to 2011 at three nested spatial scales. Survey data indicated that group sizes did not change for most species, with the exception of red colobus monkeys (Procolobus rufomitratus), in which group size increased at all spatial scales. Mangabey (Lophocebus albigena) group size increased in old-growth forest, but the sample size and increase were small. To augment this survey data, we collected several years of demographic data on three habituated groups of redtail monkeys (Cercopithecus ascanius), eight groups of black-and-white colobus (Colobus guereza), and one red colobus group. The red colobus group increased from 59 to 104 individuals, while redtail monkey and black-and-white colobus group sizes were stable, mirroring our survey results. To understand mechanisms behind group size changes in red colobus versus stability in other primates, we monitored forest dynamics at two spatial scales between 1990 and 2013, considered changes in predator population, and explored evidence of disease dynamics. The cumulative size of all trees and red colobus food trees increased over 24yr, suggesting that changing food availability was driving group size changes for red colobus, while predation and disease played lesser roles. Overall, our results and evidence of changing primate densities suggest that the Kibale primate community is in a non-equilibrium state. We suggest future conservation and management efforts take this into consideration.
   Muhtasari Idadi ya wanyama katika kundi inaweza kubadilisha ikolojia na jamii yao. Tulitaka kujua mabadiliko ya aina saba ya nyani katika hifadhi ya taifa Kibale, Uganda kuanzia mwaka 1996-2011. Tulihesabuukubwa wa makundi ya nyanikatika hifadhi na msitu uliokatwa na isuokatwa. Pia tulitaka kufahamu kama chakula kinacholiwa na nyani kinaelezea ukubwa wa kundi na mabadiliko ya ukubwawaaina ya miti katika maeneoya misitu isiyokatwa kuanzia 1990 mpaka 2013. Hakuna mabadiliko katika ukubwa wa makundi isipo kuwa mbega wekundu(Procolobus rufomitratus) ambao: waliongezeka kwa kawaida. Ukubwa wa makundi ya mangabey (Lophocebus albigena) iliongezeka katika msitu usiokatwa, lakini hakuwawa na wanyama wengi na ongezeko lilikuwa dogo. Kwa miaka kadhaa idadi ya wanyama imekuwa ikihesabiwa katika makundi mbalimbali ya nyani wasio ogopa watafiti: makundi matatu ya nyani wenye mkia mwekundu (Cercopithecus ascanius), makundi nane ya mbega wenye weusi na weupe (Colobus guereza) na kundi moja la mbega wekundu. Kundi la mbega wekundu liliongezeka mara mbili kwa ukubwa lakini makundi ya nyaniwenye mkia mwekundu na mbega wenye weusi na weupe hayakubadilika (kama matokeo ya jumla). Kwa ujumla, chakula cha tumbili katika msitu usiokatwa kiliongezeka kwa muda lakini ongezeko lilitofautiana kwa kila aina ya nyani.Kufahamu kwa nini makundi ya mbega wekundu yanakuwa makubwa wakati makundi ya nyani wengine hayawi makubwa, tulijadili madhara ya magonjwa na wanyama wanaokula nyama. Tunafikiri mabadiliko katika chakula yanaweza kuwa muhimu zaidi.Ni vigumu kuelewa ikolojia changamani ya kibale, hivyo utafiti zaidi unaitajika katika siku zijazo.

AB Several amphibian species have ecological traits that can make them vulnerable to landscape changes, such as habitat preference and reproductive strategies. We evaluated how anuran species and their respective reproductive modes were distributed in an Atlantic Forest fragmented landscape, Southeastern Brazil. We sampled through visual encounter surveys three continuous forest sites, 12 forest fragments and five pasture areas (matrix) between July 2007 and March 2010. We recorded 50 anuran species with 15 reproductive modes, a third of them (33.3%) recorded only in continuous forest sites (modes 3, 8, 19, 25 and 36). These reproductive modes found only in continuous forest sites are typically forest-associated, and seem to be more vulnerable to habitat loss. Additionally, we found a trend for larger fragments to harbor both higher number of types of reproductive sites and diversity of frog reproductive modes. Our findings suggests that fragment sizes can better predict the number of frog reproductive modes than the species richness in Atlantic Forest fragmented landscapes, and highlights the need to consider frog reproductive traits in future studies.
   Resumo Varias especies de anfibios tem caracteristicas ecologicas que podem torna-los vulneraveis a mudancas na paisagem, tais como o uso do habitat e estrategias reprodutivas. Nos avaliamos como as especies de anuros e seus respectivos modos reprodutivos estavam distribuidos em uma paisagem fragmentada de Mata Atlantica, no Sudeste do Brasil. Amostramos atraves de buscas visuais tres areas de floresta continua, 12 fragmentos florestais e cinco areas de pasto (matriz) entre julho de 2007 e marco de 2010. Registramos 50 especies de anuros com 15 modos reprodutivos, um terco destes (33.3%) registrados somente nas areas de floresta continua (modos 3, 8, 19, 25 e 36). Estes modos reprodutivos encontrados apenas em areas de floresta continua sAo tipicamente associados a floresta, e parecem ser mais vulneraveis a perda de habitat. Adicionalmente, encontramos uma tendencia de fragmentos maiores abrigarem tanto uma maior diversidade de sitios reprodutivos quanto de modos reprodutivos de anuros. Nossos resultados sugerem que os tamanhos dos fragmentos podem ser mais precisos para predizer o numero de modos reprodutivos de anuros do que a riqueza de especies em paisagens fragmentadas de Mata Atlantica, e realcam a necessidade de considerar caracteristicas reprodutivas dos anfibios em futuros estudos.

AB The high rate of amphibian endemism and the severe habitat modification in the Caribbean islands make them an ideal place to test if the current protected areas network might protect this group. In this study, we model distribution and map species richness of the 40 amphibian species from eastern Cuba with the objectives of identify hotspots, detect gaps in species representation in protected areas, and select additional areas to fill these gaps. We used two modeling methods, Maxent and Habitat Suitability Models, to reach a consensus distribution map for each species, then calculate species richness by combining specific models and finally performed gap analyses for species and hotspots. Our results showed that the models were robust enough to predict species distributions and that most of the amphibian hotspots were represented in reserves, but 50 percent of the species were incompletely covered and Eleutherodactylus rivularis was totally uncovered by the protected areas. We identified 1441 additional km(2) (9.9% of the study area) that could be added to the current protected areas, allowing the representation of every species and all hotspots. Our results are relevant for the conservation planning in other Caribbean islands, since studies like this could contribute to fill the gaps in the existing protected areas and to design a future network. Both cases would benefit from modeling amphibian species distribution using available data, even if they are incomplete, rather than relying only in the protection of known or suspected hotspots.

AB Biogeographic analysis of species turnover ( diversity) of plants and animals among regions often yields conflicting results, with regions of high diversity identified for some taxonomic groups but not others. Such discordance calls into question the use of surrogate taxa to forge conservation plans. This discordance begs for a means of comparing multiple taxa across phyla in a manner that is cost-effective, considers limitations in computer resources in certain global regions, and is understood by policy makers and land managers. As a test case for a method taking into account these considerations, we used species lists for ten organismal groups (spanning plants, vertebrates, and invertebrates) to identify regions of high diversity using Monmonier's algorithm, a spatially explicit technique that is readily implemented and interpreted. Data were for montane (>1000m elevation) species across the Eastern Arc of Tanzania and Kenya and surrounding areas. Our results indicate that surrogacy does not make for the most effective expenditure of conservation efforts. We also show that to use a multi-taxon approach one need not rely on intensive surveys of areas in order to make conservation decisions, including reserve selection. Our approach also eliminates the need for complex modeling and comparisons common to many GIS-based complementarity techniques. Additionally, a wide variety of socioeconomic, political, demographic, geological, climatological, and evolutionary factors can be incorporated into the technique to help shape conservation biogeography from a local and regional perspective. This technique can bridge the gap between conservation biogeography theory and application in tropical regions and beyond.

In upland, only 1610% (+/- 2 SEM) of stems and 21 +/- 8% of basal area were lost to fire, while seasonally flooded forest lost 59 +/- 13% of stems and 57 +/- 13% of basal area. Drier understory contributes to greater flammability. Much of the area occupied by seasonally flooded woody vegetation (>11.5 percent of the Amazon region) is vulnerable to fire due to high flammability and slow recovery.

AB Little is known about antiherbivore defenses in non-myrmecophyte Cecropia trees. We compare two non-myrmecophyte CecropiaCecropia sciadophylla and Cecropia tacunawith Cecropia membranacea, a myrmecophyte. High levels of chemical defenses in young leaves and physical toughness of mature leaves compensate for the absence of mutualistic ants in C.sciadophylla. Some C.tacuna trees produce trichilia and Mullerian bodies suggesting it has lost a mutualism with ants.
   Resumen Poco se sabe sobre las defensas contra a los herbivoros en las especies de Cecropia no-mirmecofitas. Hemos examinado las defensas contra herbivoros en dos especies no-mirmecofitos - Cecropia sciadophylla y Cecropia tacuna. Comparamos estos con Cecropia membranacea, un mirmecofita. Nuestro estudio demuestra que para C.sciadophylla hay niveles altos de defensas quimicas en las hoyas nuevas y la fortaleza fisica de las hojas maduras esto compensa por la ausencia de hormigas mutualistas. Algunos arboles C.tacuna producen trichilia y cuerpos de Muller sugiere la perdida de mutualism con hormigas.

AB Bacteria in the genus Streptomyces are ubiquitous in soil and are well-known for their production of diverse secondary metabolites, including antibiotics that can inhibit soil-borne plant pathogens and suppress disease. Pathogen-suppressive soil bacteria have the potential to influence plant community composition and diversity, but remain relatively unexplored in tropical forest soils. To estimate the potential for disease suppression among Streptomyces communities in tropical dry forests, we cultured soil-borne Streptomyces from plots in two forests in northwestern Costa Rica (Santa Rosa and Palo Verde) and quantified antibiotic-mediated pathogen inhibition against three plant pathogens. The potential for pathogen inhibition and disease suppression by Streptomyces was highly variable across the landscape. Densities of pathogen-suppressive Streptomyces varied by over ten-fold and were correlated with soil nutrients across the plots. In particular, Streptomyces communities became more pathogen-suppressive as labile soil P decreased. Inhibitor densities were significantly higher in Santa Rosa than Palo Verde, which may be related to differences in soil texture and/or plant community composition between the two forests. Our findings suggest potential differences in the degree and specificity of antibiotic-mediated disease suppression in tropical dry forest soils of Costa Rica, and highlight the need for further studies on the drivers of pathogen-suppressive phenotypes as well as the consequences of spatially variable pathogen inhibition for plant community composition in tropical forest ecosystems.
   Resumen Las bacterias del genero Streptomyces son ubicuas en el suelo y son conocidas por su capacidad de producir diversos metabolitos secundarios. Estos incluyen antibioticos que pueden inhibir fitopatogenos del suelo y disminuir enfermedades. Las bacterias que suprimen el crecimiento de patogenos pueden influir en la composicion y la diversidad de comunidades de plantas, pero han sido poco estudiadas en suelos de bosques tropicales. Para estimar el potencial de supresion de enfermedades de diferentes comunidades de Streptomyces en el bosque tropical seco, cultivamos Streptomyces de muestras de suelo colectadas en parcelas en dos bosques en la region Noroeste de Costa Rica, y cuantificamos la frecuencia e intensidad de inhibicion de tres patogenos vegetales. El potencial de inhibicion de patogenos y supresion de enfermedad de Streptomyces fue muy variable entre sitios. Las densidades de Streptomyces supresoras de patogenos variaron mas de diez veces y se observo una correlacion entre la densidad de bacterias y la concentracion de nutrientes en el suelo de las parcelas. Especificamente, hubo mayor supresion de patogenos en suelos con bajas concentraciones de fosforo labil. Las densidades de inhibidores fueron significativamente mayores en Santa Rosa que en Palo Verde, lo que puede estar relacionado con las diferencias en la textura del suelo y/o diferencias en la composicion de las comunidades vegetales entre los dos sitios. Nuestros resultados sugieren que existen diferencias en el grado y la especificidad de la supresion de enfermedades mediada por antibioticos en suelos del bosque tropical seco de Costa Rica, y resaltan la necesidad de mas estudios acerca de los factores que influyen en la presencia de diferentes fenotipos supresores de patogenos, asi como las consecuencias de la variacion espacial de la inhibicion de patogenos para la composicion de las comunidades vegetales en ecosistemas de bosques tropicales.

AB Precipitation throughfall (TF) plays an important role in the water balance of tropical forests. This study used 164 gauges to quantify precipitation and TF variability in a tropical pre-montane transitional cloud forest on the Caribbean slope of the Cordillera Tilaran, Costa Rica, to identify the ecological and meteorological drivers of this variability. Daily TF measurements were taken from 28 June to 17 July 2012 and 12 June to 16 July 2013, for a total of 39 precipitation events. The total mean TF was 87.9 percent and TF at individual gauges ranged from 22.7 percent to 245.7 percent. Leaf area index (LAI) was calculated above each gauge using hemispheric photography for a mean study-site LAI of 7.7. There was no statistically significant relationship between LAI and TF. However, the amount of TF was positively correlated with precipitation intensity, while the variability of TF was negatively correlated with precipitation intensity. Our calculations indicate that at least 61 gauges are required to obtain mean TF estimates with less than 5 percent error. This study demonstrates that TF is highly spatially heterogeneous due to multiple compounding effects.
   RESUMEN Precipitacion interna a traves del dosel del bosque (TF) es una parte importante del equilibrio de agua en bosques tropicales. Este estudio tuvo como objetivo cuantificar la variabilidad de precipitacion y TF en un bosque nuboso transicional y premontano en el lado Caribe de la Cordillera Tilaran, especificamente en el Centro Soltis, Costa Rica, e identificar los factores ecologicos y meteorologicos en esta variabilidad. Mediante 164 pluviometros, se obtuvieron lecturas diarias de precipitacion interna, desde 28 Junio -17 Julio 2012 y 12 Junio-16 Julio 2013, abarcando 39 eventos pluviales. El promedio total de la precipitacion interna fue 87.9% y la precipitacion interna de los pluviometros fluctuaron entre 22.7% y 245.7%. Mediante fotografia hemisferica se calcularon los indices de area foliar (LAI) sobre cada pluviometro. El promedio del LAI fue 7.7. No hubo una relacion estadisticamente significativa entre LAI y TF; sin embargo, hubo una correlacion positiva entre la precipitacion interna y la intensidad de la precipitacion, y la variabilidad de la precipitacion interna correlaciono negativamente con la intensidad de la precipitacion. Nuestros resultados indican que al menos 61 pluviometros son necesarios para determinar los promedios de precipitacion interna con menos de 5% de error. Este estudio demuestra que la precipitacion interna es espacialmente heterogenea debido a muchos efectos amontonados.

AB Seed banks contribute to forest regeneration after disturbance, but less is known about fern spore banks, particularly in a paleotropical context. We sampled the buried seed and fern spore bank in Mabira Forest, a 300km(2) forest in central Uganda, to explore the effect of time since disturbance. Soil cores (5cm depth) were taken from 39 plots across three different classes of recovery': (1) not disturbed since 1950; (2) logged between 1950 and 1980; and (3) cleared for agriculture between 1970 and 1990 but reforested since. Plant emergence was monitored in a glasshouse. We predicted that the seed bank would reflect time since disturbance, with more pioneer species in recently disturbed stands, and that the fern spore bank would reflect stand age less closely due to greater dispersal capacity. We recorded a median 752 seeds per square meter, most of which were trees; the most abundant species was the invasive tree Broussonetia papyrifera. The fern spore bank was twice as dense, but 95 percent of fern spores were of one species, Christella parasitica. Tree seed density was significantly affected by time since disturbance with fewer seeds in the older stands. Herb seed density, fern spore density, and species richness for all groups were not significantly affected by time since disturbance. Neither seed bank nor fern spore bank closely resembled the aboveground vegetation. We compared our results to existing literature on seed banks in tropical forests, finding that our densities are relatively high for African forests, but low compared to the Neotropics and Australia.
   RESUME Les banques de graines contribuent a la regeneration des forets apres perturbation, mais nous savons encore peu de choses au sujet des banques de spores de fougeres, particulierement dans un contexte paleotropical. Nous avons enregistre les graines ainsi que les spores de fougeres enterrees dans la foret de Mabira, une foret de 300km(2) au centre de l'Ouganda, et explore l'impact du temps passe depuis une perturbation. Les echantillons de terre ont ete preleves jusqu'a 5cm de profondeur dans 39 parcelles caracterisees par differents degres de reconstruction: non perturbee depuis 1950, exploitee entre 1950 et 1980, et deboisee pour des fins d'agriculture entre 1970 et 1990 puis reboisee. L'emergence a ete suivie dans une serre. Nous avons predit que la banque de graines allait refleter le temps passe depuis la perturbation, avec davantage d'especes pionnieres dans les parcelles recemment perturbees, mais que ce patron serait moins remarquable pour la banque de spores en raison de meilleures capacites de dispersion. Nous avons enregistre une mediane de 752 graines par metre carre, dons la plupart etaient des graines d'arbres ; la graine la plus abondante etait le petit arbre invasif Broussonetia papyrifera. La banque de spores de fougeres etait deux fois plus dense mais 95 pourcent de ces spores appartenaient a une seule espece, Christella parasitica. La densite de graines d'arbres etait significativement affectee par le temps passe depuis la perturbation, avec moins de graines dans les parcelles les plus anciennes. La densite de graines d'herbes, la densite de spores de fougeres et la richesse specifique pour tous les groupes n'etaient pas significativement affectees par le temps passe depuis la perturbation. Ni la banque de graines, ni la banque de spores de fougeres ne ressemblait vraiment a la vegetation de surface. Nous avons compare nos resultats a la litterature existant sur les banques de graines en foret tropicale, et trouve que nos densites etaient relativement fortes par rapport aux forets africaines, mais basses comparees aux forets neotropicales et australiennes.

AB Many studies analyzing the relative contribution of soil properties versus distance-related processes on plant species composition have focused on lowland tropical forests. Very few have investigated two forest types simultaneously, to contrast ecological processes that assemble the communities. This study analysesat the landscape scalethe relative contribution of soil and distance on lowland and submontane tropical forests, which co-occur in two reserves of the Azuero peninsula (Panama). Floristic inventories and soil sampling were conducted in 81 0.1-ha plots clustered in 27 sites, and data were analyzed using Mantel tests, variance partitioning and non-metric multidimensional scaling. The largest differences in floristic composition occurred between reserves in both forest types. Soil variation and geographic distance were important determinants of floristic composition, but their effects were highly correlated; together they explained 7-25 percent and 46-50 percent of the variation in lowland and submontane forests, respectively. Soil variables that had the best correlations with floristic composition were iron, zinc, and silt content in lowland, and calcium, copper, iron, potassium, magnesium, phosphorus, zinc, and sand content in submontane forests. The studied forests showed a high beta diversity that seems to be related primarily with soils and, secondarily, with dispersal limitation and stochastic events. The results reveal a response of tree assemblages to environmental gradients, which are particularly conspicuous in Panama. The effects of limited dispersal seem to be more important in submontane than in lowland forests, probably as a result of higher isolation.
   Resumen Muchos estudios que analizan la contribucion relativa de las propiedades del suelo y de los procesos relacionados con la distancia geografica sobre la composicion floristica se han centrado en bosques tropicales de tierras bajas. Sin embargo, muy pocos han analizado los efectos de esos factores sobre la composicion floristica de dos tipos de bosque simultaneamente. Este estudio investiga -a escala de paisaje- la contribucion relativa del suelo y la distancia sobre la composicion de bosques semi-caducifolios de tierras bajas y bosques ombrofilos submontanos, que cohabitan en dos reservas forestales de la peninsula de Azuero (Panama). Para ello, analizamos los datos de inventarios floristicos y muestras de suelo en 81 parcelas de 0.1ha agrupadas en 27 localidades mediante test de Mantel, particion de la varianza y escalamiento multidimensional no metrico. Los resultados mostraron una mayor diferencia entre la composicion de ambas reservas que entre tipos de bosque. El suelo y la distancia tuvieron un efecto importante en la composicion floristica dentro de las reservas, aunque ambos estuvieron muy correlacionados y, en promedio, explicaron de forma conjunta entre un 7 y un 25% y entre un 46 y un 50% de la variacion en la composicion de bosques de tierras bajas y submontanos respectivamente. Las variables edaficas mas correlacionadas con el patron floristico fueron hierro, zinc y contenido de limo para los bosques de tierras bajas, y calcio, cobre, hierro, potasio, magnesio, fosforo, zinc y contenido de arena para los bosques submontanos. Los bosques analizados muestran una alta diversidad beta que parece estar relacionada en primer lugar con las propiedades del suelo, y en segundo lugar con la limitacion en la dispersion y otros procesos estocasticos. Estos resultados sugieren la existencia de gradientes ambientales acusados sobre los ensamblajes de arboles en Panama. En general, el efecto de la limitacion en la dispersion es mayor en bosques submontanos, como consecuencia probablemente de un mayor aislamiento.

AB Hunting pressure, fragmentation and deforestation have caused global declines in animal abundance, and the consequences for plant communities are poorly understood. Many large-seeded plants, for instance, depend on large and endangered vertebrates for seed dispersal. In some Semi-deciduous Atlantic Forests, endangered tapirs (Tapirus terrestris) are major dispersers of pindo palms (Syagrus romanzoffiana). Here, we compare recruitment patterns of pindo palms between protected and disturbed (defaunated) Atlantic Forest areas in Argentina and evaluate the potential consequences of the lack of the main disperser for pindo palm regeneration. We analyzed the number and spatial pattern of pindo adults, offspring, and tapir dung piles within ten plots established in an area spanning tapir latrines inside Iguazu National Park and in a fragmented forest area outside the park where tapir is locally extinct. In both areas, we evaluated recruitment levels beneath 24 adult palms in circular plots centered on adult stems. We found lower pindo palm recruitment outside the park where offspring tended to be aggregated around adult palms. In contrast, in Iguazu National Park offspring were spatially associated with tapir dung-piles, in which most offspring were registered. Recruitment under adults was higher outside the park suggesting a lower rate of seed removal in disturbed areas. Our results show that tapir dispersal promotes higher recruitment levels of pindo offspring and shapes their spatial pattern, breaking the spatial association with adult (presumably maternal) palms. These results are useful for predicting the impact of local tapir extinction on this palm.
   Resumen La presion de caza, la fragmentacion y la deforestacion han causado una declinacion en la abundancia de animales con consecuencias desconocidas para las comunidades vegetales. Muchas plantas de semillas grandes dependen de vertebrados amenazados para su dispersion. En el Bosque Atlantico semi-deciduo, los tapires (Tapirus terrestris) son los principales dispersores de la palmera pindo (Syagrus romanzoffiana). Comparamos los patrones de reclutamiento del pindo entre areas protegidas y perturbadas (defaunadas) del Bosque Atlantico en Argentina y evaluamos las consecuencias de la falta de su principal dispersor. Analizamos el numero y patron espacial de palmeras adultas, renovales y heces de tapir en diez parcelas establecidas en un area con letrinas de tapir dentro del Parque Nacional Iguazu y en un area de bosque fragmentado fuera del parque donde el tapir esta localmente extinto. Tambien evaluamos niveles de reclutamiento debajo de 24 palmeras adultas en parcelas circulares centradas en sus troncos. Encontramos un menor reclutamiento de pindo fuera del Parque, donde los renovales se agregaban alrededor de los adultos. Dentro del parque, los renovales estaban espacialmente asociados a heces de tapir, donde se registraron la mayoria. El reclutamiento debajo de palmeras adultas fue mayor fuera del Parque sugiriendo una menor tasa de remocion de semillas en areas perturbadas. Nuestros resultados muestran que la dispersion por tapir promueve un mayor reclutamiento de renovales de pindo y moldea su patron espacial, rompiendo la asociacion espacial con los adultos. Estos resultados son utiles para predecir el impacto de la extincion local del tapir sobre esta palmera.

AB While overall numbers of African elephant have declined dramatically in recent times, some populations are now confined to protected areas and are locally overabundantan undesirable situation for both biodiversity conservation and elephants. In forested protected areas, options to manage elephants are limited because it is difficult to safely approach animals, yet it is vital that these populations are managed because browsing by elephants can dramatically alter forest ecosystems. Using data collected over 50yr in Kibale National Park, Uganda, we examine the prediction that increasing elephant numbers and associated changes in their foraging behavior have caused a shift in tree community composition. Although the relative abundance of elephants increased significantly between 1996 and 2010, the population structure of their preferred tree food species did not change, nor did tree community composition change in favor of species able to re-sprout after elephant damage. Furthermore, over the last 50yr Kibale elephants have not become more selective foragers, as would be expected if more nutritious tree species were declining. However, elephants are more abundant in disturbed areas dominated by shrubs and grasses and appear to have arrested forest succession in these areas. At their current abundance, elephants have not selectively altered the composition of intact old growth forest, but they do inhibit the regeneration of disturbed areas.
   Resumen Aunque las cifras globales de elefantes africanos han disminuido drasticamente en los ultimos tiempos, algunas poblaciones estan ahora confinados a las areas protegidas y son localmente sobreabundantes siendo una situacion indeseable tanto para la conservacion de la biodiversidad como para los elefantes. En areas forestales protegidas, las opciones para el manejo de los elefantes estan limitadas debido a que es dificil acercarse a los animales de forma segura, sin embargo, es vital que estas poblaciones se manejan porque el ramoneo realizado por los elefantes puede alterar dramaticamente los ecosistemas forestales. Utilizando los datos recopilados a lo largo de 50 anos en el Parque Nacional Kibale, Uganda, examinamos la prediccion de que un creciente numero de elefantes y los cambios asociados en su comportamiento de forrajeo han provocado un cambio en la composicion de la comunidad de arboles. Aunque la abundancia relativa de los elefantes aumento significativamente entre 1996 y 2010, la estructura poblacional de las especies arboreas preferidas como alimento y la composicion de la comunidad de arboles no cambio; por ejemplo, a favor de las especies capaces de rebrotar despues de un dano hecho por los elefantes. Ademas, en los ultimos 50 anos los elefantes en Kibale no se han convertido en forrajeros mas selectivos, como se esperaria si las especies de arboles mas nutritivos estuviesen disminuyendo. Sin embargo, los elefantes son mas abundantes en areas perturbadas dominadas por arbustos y hierbas, y parecen haber detenido la sucesion forestal en estas areas. En su abundancia actual, los elefantes no han alterado selectivamente la composicion de bosques intactos de edad madura, pero si inhiben la regeneracion de areas perturbadas.

AB In closed-canopy tropical forest understory, light availability is a significant determinant of habitat diversity because canopy structure is highly variable in most tropical forests. Consequently, variation in canopy cover affects the composition and distribution of plant species via creating variable light environments. Nevertheless, little is known about how variation in canopy openness structures patterns of plant-animal interactions. Because of the great diversity and dominance of ants in tropical environments, we used ant-plant interactions as a focal network to evaluate how variation in canopy cover influences patterns of plant-insect interactions in the Brazilian Amazon rain forest. We observed that small increases in canopy openness are associated with increased diversity of ant-plant interactions in our study area, and this change is independent of plant or ant species richness. Additionally, we found smaller niche overlap for both ants and plants associated with greater canopy openness. We hypothesize that enhanced light availability increases the breadth of ant foraging sources because variation in light availability gives rise to plant resources of different quality and amounts. Moreover, greater light availability promotes vegetative growth in plants, creating ant foraging bridges' between plants. In sum, our results highlight the importance of environmental heterogeneity as a determinant of ant-plant interaction diversity in tropical environments.
   Resumo No interior do sub-bosque de densas florestas tropicais, a disponibilidade de luz e um fator que determina a diversidade de habitats, principalmente porque a estrutura do dossel e altamente variavel na maioria das florestas tropicais. Consequentemente, a variacAo na cobertura do dossel afeta a composicAo e distribuicAo das especies de plantas, criando ambientes com diferentes niveis de luz. No entanto, pouco e o conhecimento de como a variacAo na abertura do dossel estrutura os padroes de interacoes planta-animal. Devido a grande diversidade e dominancia de formigas nos ambientes tropicais, nos usamos como modelo de estudo as interacoes formiga-planta em uma floresta tropical na Amazonia brasileira. Nos observamos que pequenas mudancas na abertura do dossel esta associada com o aumento da diversidade das interacoes formiga-planta na nossa area de estudo, e essa mudanca e independente da riqueza de formigas ou de plantas. Adicionalmente, nos encontramos baixa sobreposicAo de nicho tanto para formigas quanto de plantas em ambientes com maior abertura do dossel. Nos hipotetizamos que a disponibilidade de luz aumenta a possibilidade de forrageamento das formigas, uma vez que, a variacAo na disponibilidade de luz fornece diferentes quantidades e qualidades de recurso disponivel nas plantas. Alem disso, a maior disponibilidade de luz promove o crescimento vegetativo das plantas, criando pontes entre as plantas para o forrageamento das formigas. Em resumo, nossos resultados destacam a importancia da heterogeneidade ambiental como um fator que determina a diversidade das interacoes formiga-planta em ambientes tropicais.

AB Conservation of biodiversity in production forests is crucial for mitigating biodiversity loss in the tropics. The major ecological impacts of selective logging are often the result of small clearings for skid trails, logging roads, log yards, and logging camps; however, their impacts on forest biodiversity have rarely been examined. The purpose of this study was to assess the impacts of these clearings on a forest-dependent faunal group, dung beetles, and to identify the environmental factors responsible. Abundance and species richness of dung beetles decreased drastically in clearings, but directly increased in forests with the distance from roads/trails; abundance and species richness at 10m from roads/trails were almost comparable with those detected in further interior forests. Similarly, species composition was significantly different between forests and clearings (except skid trails) but recovered within a short distance from roads/trails. Canopy openness was the most important environmental factor affecting the abundance, and species richness and composition of dung beetles; most dung beetle species were concentrated under closed forest canopy with less than 10 percent of canopy openness, whereas canopy openness ranged from 16 to 53 percent in clearings. Our study demonstrates that even small-scale, unpaved clearings affect dung beetle communities through increased canopy openness. Although the effective distance was not very large, a considerable portion of logged areas can be affected when road networks are dense therefore minimizing the density of road networks and enhancing canopy recovery after logging are important for retaining biodiversity in tropical production forests.
   Abstrak Pemeliharaan biodiversiti dalam hutan pengusahasilan amat penting dalam mitigasi kehilangan biodiversiti di kawasan tropika. Impak utama daripada aktiviti pembalakkan biasanya berpunca daripada pembersihan kawasan berskala kecil untuk pembinaan jalan penarik, jalan tuju, matau dan kongsi (penempatan sementara). Namun, impak pembersihan kawasan ini ke atas biodiversiti jarang dikaji.Tujuan utama kajian ini ialah untuk menilai impak kawasan yang dibersihkan ini ke atas kumbang tinja, iaitu kumpulan fauna yang bergantung kepada habitat hutan, serta mengenalpasti faktor-faktor persekitaran yang menyebabkan perubahan ini. Kelimpahan dan kekayaan spesis kumbang tinja didapati berkurangan dengan ketara di kawasan yang dibersihkan tetapi meningkat dengan peningkatan jarak daripada jalan/denai di dalam kawasan hutan. Kelimpahan dan kepelbagain spesis kumbang tinja 10m daripada jalan/denai adalah serupa dengan kelimpahan dan kepelbagaian spesis yang berada jauh di dalam kawasan hutan. Komposisi spesis di antara kawasan hutan dan kawasan yang telah dibersihkan (kecuali jalan tarik) adalah berbeza tetapi mulai menjadi serupa tidak jauh daripada jalan/denai. Pembukaan silara merupakan faktor persekitaran paling penting yang mempengaruhi kelimpahan, kepelbagaian dan komposisi spesis kumbang tinja di mana kebanyakkan spesis kumbang tinja tertumpu di kawasan dengan pembukaan silara kurang daripada 10 peratus. Kawasan yang telah dibersihkan merekodkan pembukaan silara sebanyak 16 hingga 53 peratus. Kajian ini menunjukkan aktiviti pembersihan kawasan walaupun pada skala kecil akan meningkatkan pembukaan silara lalu memberi impak kepada komuniti kumbang tinja. Walaupun jarak impak daripada kawasan yang dibersihkan adalah kecil, namun ia akan melibatkan kawasan yang luas sekiranya jaringan jalan di sesuatu hutan pengusahasilan adalah padat. Maka pembinaan jalan perlu diminimumkan dan pemuliharaan pembukaan silara adalah mustahak bagi tujuan pemeliharaan bidoversiti di hutan pengusahasilan.

AB In situations where native mutualists have become extinct, non-native species may partner with remnant native species. However, non-native mutualists may differ behaviorally from extinct native mutualists. In the case of pollination, novel relationships between natives and non-natives could differ both quantitatively and qualitatively from native-native relationships. In Hawai'i, the non-native Japanese White-eye (Zosterops japonicus) has largely replaced endemic birds as pollinator of the endemic Clermontia parviflora and C.montis-loa. We surveyed Clermontia patches and found that they ranged from 106 to 1198m in diameter. We performed manual pollination of flowers with pollen taken from plants at five distance categories, ranging from 0 (self-fertilization) to 20km, and examined the germination of resulting seeds. We used radiotelemetry to estimate daily Japanese White-eye movement distances. Percent germination of seeds after short- to intermediate-distance pollination crosses (i.e., 20-1200m, or intra-patch pollen transfer distances) significantly exceeded germination of seeds from selfed trials for C.parviflora. No significant differences in germination rates among treatments were detected for C.montis-loa. The maximum daily movement distances of radio-tracked birds were generally <1km. Together, these results suggest that this novel pollinator may be an effective mutualist for both Clermontia species. This study serves as an example of research examining qualitative components of novel mutualism, which are generally neglected relative to quantitative components.

AB Complex networks of species interactions might be determined by species traits but also by simple chance meetings governed by species abundances. Although the idea that species traits structure mutualistic networks is appealing, most studies have found abundance to be a major structuring mechanism underlying interaction frequencies. With a well-resolved plant-hummingbird interaction network from the Neotropical savanna in Brazil, we asked whether species morphology, phenology, nectar availability and habitat occupancy and/or abundance best predicted the frequency of interactions. For this, we constructed interaction probability matrices and compared them to the observed plant-hummingbird matrix through a likelihood approach. Furthermore, a recently proposed modularity algorithm for weighted bipartite networks was employed to evaluate whether these factors also scale-up to the formation of modules in the network. Interaction frequencies were best predicted by species morphology, phenology and habitat occupancy, while species abundances and nectar availability performed poorly. The plant-hummingbird network was modular, and modules were associated to morphological specialization and habitat occupancy. Our findings highlight the importance of traits as determinants of interaction frequencies and network structure, corroborating the results of a previous study on a plant-hummingbird network from the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Thus, we propose that traits matter more in tropical plant-hummingbird networks than in less specialized systems. To test the generality of this hypothesis, future research could employ geographic or taxonomic cross-system comparisons contrasting networks with known differences in level of specialization.
   Resumo Redes complexas de interacoes entre especies podem ser determinadas pelos atributos das especies, mas tambem meramente pelos encontros aleatorios governados pelas suas abundancias. Embora a ideia de que os atributos das especies estruturam as redes mutualisticas seja atraente, a maioria dos estudos tem observado a abundancia como principal fator determinante da frequencia das interacoes. Nesse estudo, investigamos uma rede de interacAo entre plantas e beija-flores no Cerrado do Brasil, para compreender se morfologia, fenologia, disponibilidade de nectar, ocupacAo de habitat e/ou abundancia das especies sAo capazes de predizer a frequencia das interacoes na comunidade. Para isso, nos construimos matrizes de probabilidades de interacoes e as comparamos com a matriz de interacAo observada, utilizando analise de verossimilhanca e selecAo de modelos. Alem disso, um algoritmo recentemente proposto para calcular a modularidade em redes bipartidas quantitativas foi utilizado para avaliar se (e como) esses fatores contribuem para a formacAode modulosna rede. A frequencia de interacoes na rede foi melhor predita pela morfologia, fenologia e ocupacAo de habitat, enquanto a abundancia e disponibilidade de nectar tiveram pior desempenho. As interacoes entre plantas e beija-flores se organizaram em modulos, que foram associados com especializacAo morfologica e ocupacAo de habitat. Nossos resultados mostram a importancia dos atributos das especies na determinacAo da frequencia de interacoes e estrutura da rede, corroborando os resultados de um estudo previo com uma rede de plantas e beija-flor na Mata Atlantica. Assim, nos propomos que os atributos das especies tem papel estruturador mais importante em redes de interacoes entre plantas e beija-flores tropicais do que em sistemas menos especializados. Para testar a generalidade desta hipotese, sugerimos que estudos futuros empreguem comparacoesgeograficas ou taxonomicasentre diferentes sistemas, contrastando redes de interacoes com diferentes niveis de especializacAo.

AB According to the acoustic adaptation hypothesis, abiotic noise generated by streams should promote the evolution of high-pitched signals in acoustically communicating animals. The putatively selective effect is best demonstrated by studying trait-environment correlations across recently or currently diverging lineages, and when we understand the ecological interactions that underlie the selective pressures. We studied microclimate, frog distribution, abiotic noise, and the frequency of the advertisement call of the Andean poison frog Andinobates bombetes across variable environmental clines at five localities. Our general hypothesis involves three steps: microclimatic clines determine frogs' distribution, which in turn is associated with different levels of abiotic noise that select for differentially pitched calls. Microclimate changed more abruptly with distance to streams in comparatively dry localities. There, frogs were more aggregated alongside streams and, in turn, experienced higher levels of abiotic noise. As predicted, frogs living alongside streams in dry forests called at higher frequencies, and thus attained comparable signal-to-noise ratios, compared with stream-away frogs. Our data support a role for microclimate in determining frog distribution and thereby the noise conditions that promoted a divergence in a mate-recognition signal.
   Resumen La hipotesis de adaptacion acustica predice que el ruido abiotico en quebradas podria promover la evolucion de cantos a altas frecuencias en animales que utilizan senales auditivas en su comunicacion. Esta hipotesis de evolucion adaptativa se demuestra mejor mediante el estudio de correlaciones entre el rasgo fenotipico de interes y una caracteristica ambiental en linajes recientemente divergentes, y cuando entendemos las interacciones ecologicas que subyacen a las presiones selectivas. Estudiamos el microclima, la distribucion de individuos, el ruido abiotico y la frecuencia de la llamada de anuncio de la rana venenosa Andinobates bombetes a traves de clinas ambientales en cinco localidades. Nuestra hipotesis general consta de tres pasos: clinas microclimaticas determinan la distribucion de individuos, lo que a su vez, implica que algunas ranas deban comunicarse en ambientes con alta exposicion a ruido abiotico y de ahi, se promoveria la evolucion de cantos a altas frecuencias. El microclima cambio mas abruptamente con la distancia a las quebradas en localidades de bosque seco que en localidades de bosque humedo. En las primeras localidades, las ranas estuvieron mas agregadas hacia las quebradas y a su vez, experimentaron mayores niveles de ruido abiotico en su entorno. Como se predijo, las ranas que viven cerca de quebradas en bosques secos exhibieron cantos con frecuencias mas altas y por lo tanto, lograron una relacion senal-ruido comparable a la de ranas viviendo lejos de quebradas en localidades con bosque humedo. Nuestros datos apoyan el rol del microclima en determinar la distribucion de las ranas y de este modo, su exposicion a las condiciones de ruido que promovieron la divergencia en una senal importante en procesos de seleccion de pareja y reconocimiento de conespecificos.

AB The level of genetic diversity in a population can affect ecological processes and plant responses to disturbance. In turn, disturbance can alter population genetic diversity and structure. Populations in fragmented and logged habitats often show reduced genetic diversity and increased inbreeding and differentiation. Long-term harvesting of wild plants (for foliage, bark, and roots), can affect population genetic diversity by altering individual fitness and genetic contribution. Our understanding of these changes in genetic diversity due to the harvesting of plant organs is still limited. We used nine microsatellite markers to study the effect of long-term bark and foliage harvest by Fulani people on the genetic diversity and structure of 12 populations of African mahogany (Khaya senegalensis) in Benin. We sampled 20 individuals in each population to test the effect of harvesting. For each population, we divided the samples equally between seedling and adults to test if the effects are stronger in seedlings. We found moderate genetic diversity (H-e=0.53 +/- 0.04) and weak but significant differentiation among local populations (F-ST=0.043, P<0.001). There was no significant effect of harvest on genetic diversity or structure, although previous work found significant negative effects of harvest on the reproduction of adults, offspring density, and population fitness. Our results suggest that demographic responses to disturbance precede a detectable genetic response. Future studies should focus on using parentage analysis to test if genotypes of harvested parents are directly represented in the offspring populations.

AB Tropical forest conservation and restoration require an understanding of the movements and habitat preferences of important seed dispersers. With forests now being altered at an unprecedented rate, avian frugivores are becoming increasingly vital for forest regeneration. Seed movement, however, is highly dependent on the behavioral characteristics of their dispersers. Here, we examined the movements, habitat preferences, and range sizes of two African frugivores: the Black-casqued (Ceratogymna atrata) and the White-thighed (Bycanistes albotibialis) Hornbill, in the lowland rain forests of southern Cameroon. Using satellite transmitters, we tracked eight hornbills for 3yr to characterize their movements and relate them to environmental landscape features. Hornbill movements differed significantly, with B.albotibialis ranging over larger areas (mean=20,274ha) than C.atrata (mean=5604ha), and females of both species covering over 15 times the area of males. Evidence suggests that movements are irruptive during particular periods, perhaps driven by low resource availability. In addition, hornbills often returned to the same localities within a year, although movements were not characterized as migratory. Both species displayed significant differences in habitat preference, with B.albotibialis utilizing disturbed habitat more frequently than C.atrata (t=-22.04, P=2.2x10(-16)). Major roads were found to act as barriers for C.atrata, but not for B.albotibialis. The ability of both hornbill species to move large distances suggests hornbills will play a vital role in the maintenance and regeneration of rain forests in Central Africa as forest fragmentation increases and terrestrial vertebrates decline in numbers.
   Resume Conservation des forets tropicales et de la restauration, il faut comprendre les mouvements et les preferences d'habitat des disseminateurs de graines importantes. Avec ses forets actuellement modifies a un rythme sans precedent, les oiseaux frugivores sont de plus en plus vital pour la regeneration de la foret. mouvement des semences, cependant, est tres dependante des caracteristiques comportementales de leurs dispersants. Ici, nous avons examine les mouvements, les preferences en matiere d'habitat, de tailles et de gamme de deux frugivores africaines: le (Ceratogymna atrata) noir a casque et le calao a cuisses blanches (Bycanistes albotibialis), dans les forets tropicales de plaine du sud du Cameroun. L'aide d'emetteurs satellites, nous avons suivi huit calaos pendant trois ans pour caracteriser leurs mouvements et de les relier a des elements du paysage de l'environnement. mouvements de Calao differaient significativement, avec B.albotibialis allant sur de grandes surfaces (moyenne=20,274ha) que C.atrata (moyenne=5604ha), et les femelles des deux especes couvrant plus de 15 fois la superficie des hommes. Les preuves suggerent que les mouvements sont irruptive durant des periodes determinees, peut-etre entraines par la faible disponibilite des ressources. En outre, les calaos souvent renvoyes aux memes localites situees dans un an, meme si les mouvements ne sont pas caracterises comme migratoire. Les deux especes apparaissent des differences significatives dans les preferences de l'habitat, avec B.albotibialis utilisant habitat perturbe plus frequemment que C.atrata (t=-22.04, P=2.2x10(-16)). Les routes principales ont ete trouves a agir comme des barrieres pour C.atrata, mais pas pour B.albotibialis. La capacite des deux especes de calao de deplacer de grandes distances suggere calaos joueront un role essentiel dans le maintien et la regeneration des forets en Afrique centrale que la fragmentation de la foret augmente et les vertebres terrestres baisse du nombre.

AB We apply a process-based model, called 3-PG (physiological principles for predicting growth), to estimate aboveground biomass for the primary forests of Borneo. Using publicly available soil and climate data, and parameterized with physiological traits of Bornean forest, the modeled aboveground biomass and basal area showed statistically significant relationships with field-measured data from 85 sites across four major forest types. Our results highlight the possibility to expand the application of 3-PG to forests of varying condition, which would facilitate inclusion of modeled forest biomass data for developing a Tier 3 carbon inventory system for Borneo.

AB Herbivory has been identified as a potent evolutionary force, but its ecological impacts have been frequently underestimated. Leaf-cutting ants represent one of the most important herbivores of the Neotropics and offer an interesting opportunity to address the role played by herbivorous insects through a perspective that embraces population- to ecosystem-level effects. Here we: (1) qualitatively summarize the multiple ways leaf-cutting ants interact with food plants and their habitats and elucidate the ultimate outcome of such interactions at multiple organization levels; (2) update our understanding of leaf-cutting ant-promoted disturbance regimes; and (3) examine potential ecological roles by leaf-cutting ants within the context of human-modified landscapes to guide future research agendas. First, we find that leaf-cutting ants show that some herbivorous insects are able to generate ecologically important disturbance regimes via non-trophic activities. Second, impacts of leaf-cutting ants can be observed at multiple spatio-temporal scales and levels of biological organization. Third, ecosystem-level effects from leaf-cutting ants are ecosystem engineering capable not only of altering the abundance of other organisms, but also the successional trajectory of vegetation. Finally, effects of leaf-cutting ants are context-dependent, species-specific, and synergistically modulated by anthropogenic interferences. Future research should examine how leaf-cutting ants respond to deforestation and influence remaining vegetation in human-modified landscapes. By promoting either heterogeneity or homogeneity, leaf-cutting ants operate not only as agricultural pests but also as ecological key players.

AB Following perturbation, different assemblages that originate under the same abiotic conditions initiate successional pathways that may continue to diverge or converge toward an eventual climax. Forest regeneration in the Central Amazon begins with alternative successional pathways associated with prior land use. In a 12-yr study of secondary forests, initially ranging between 2 and 19yrs after abandonment, we compared species compositions through time along two pathways, abandoned clear-cuts dominated by Cecropia and abandoned pastures dominated by Vismia; prior results at these sites have not directly evaluated species composition. At all ages, the Chao-Jaccard similarity index of species composition was highest comparing pasture transects to each other, lowest comparing pastures transects to clear-cut transects, and intermediate comparing clear-cut transects to each other. Through time, clear-cut transects became less similar to each other, as did pasture transects. Changes in similarity reflected declining dominance along both pathways, but Cecropia dominance of clear-cut transects declined more rapidly than Vismia dominance of pasture transects. A rich association of species replaced Cecropia in clear-cut transects, resulting in decreased similarity among them. In pasture transects one genus, Bellucia, replaced the lost Vismia, so similarity of Vismia transects was maintained despite some turnover in dominance. Overall, even with turnover of individuals and decline of the dominant pioneers, the alternative pathways exhibited strikingly different species assemblies after two decades of succession, suggesting that the effect of land use persists well beyond initial floristic composition.

AB Much of the world's tropical forests have been affected by anthropogenic disturbance. These forests are important biodiversity reservoirs whose diversity, structure and function must be characterized across the successional sequence. We examined changes in structure and diversity along a successional gradient in the lowlands of New Guinea. To do this, we measured and identified all stems 5cm diameter in 19 0.25ha plots ranging in age from 3 to >50yr since disturbance. We also measured plant functional traits related to establishment, performance, and competitive ability. In addition, we examined change in forest structure, composition, species diversity, and functional diversity through succession. By using rarefaction to estimate functional diversity, we compared changes in functional diversity while controlling for associated differences in stem and species density. Basal area and species density increased with stand age while stem density was highest in intermediate secondary forests. Species composition differed strongly between mature and secondary forests. As forests increased in basal area, community-weighted mean wood density and foliar carbon increased, whereas specific leaf area and proportion of stems with exudate decreased. Foliar nitrogen peaked in medium-aged forests. Functional diversity was highest in mature forests, even after accounting for differences in stem and species diversity. Our study represents one of the first attempts to document successional changes in New Guinea's lowland forest. We found robust evidence that as succession proceeds, communities occupy a greater range of functional trait space even after controlling for stem and species density. High functional diversity is important for ecological resiliency in the face of global change.

AB Tropical late-successional tree species are at high risk of local extinction due to habitat loss and fragmentation. Population-growth rates in fragmented populations are predicted to decline as a result of reduced fecundity, survival and growth. We examined the demographic effects of habitat fragmentation by comparing the population dynamics of the late-successional tree Poulsenia armata (Moraceae) in southern Mexico between a continuous forest and several forest fragments using integral projection models (IPMs) during 2010-2012. Forest fragmentation did not lead to differences in population density and even resulted in a higher population-growth rate () in fragments compared to continuous forests. Habitat fragmentation had drastic effects on the dynamics of P.armata, causing the population structure to shift toward smaller sizes. Fragmented populations experienced a significant decrease in juvenile survival and growth compared to unaltered populations. Adult survival and growth made the greatest relative contributions to in both habitat types during 2011-2012. However, the relative importance of juvenile survival and growth to was highest in the fragmented forest in 2010-2011. Our Life Table Response Experiment analysis revealed that positive contributions of adult fecundity explained most of the variation of between both habitats and annual periods. Finally, P.armata has a relatively slow speed of recovery after disturbances, compromising persistence of fragmented populations. Developing a mechanistic understanding of how forest fragmentation affects plant population dynamics, as done here, will prove essential for the preservation of natural areas.

AB The Eastern Arc Mountains are believed to support some of the oldest tropical forest in the world. The current distribution of this forest is highly fragmented due to a combination of long-term effects of past changes in global climate and more recent deforestation. We sought to explore the hypothesized antiquity and long-term isolation of the Eastern Arc montane forests based on an assessment of the geographical distribution and interspecies similarity of chloroplast DNA sequence variation in five forest trees. Data were used to investigate regional patterns of diversity and population structure based on intraspecific phylogenies, and results were interpreted against hypotheses on ecosystem age and connectivity. Regional diversity was high, with up to 22 chloroplast DNA haplotypes being recorded within a species across the sampled populations. Geographical concordance of genetic and geographic structure was weak to absent in all species and there was little similarity of genetic structure between species. Haplotype sharing between mountain blocks was extremely limited. The generally weak phylogeographical structure, in conjunction with high regional diversity and genetic uniqueness of individual mountain forests does not support the assumption of widespread genetic connectivity of the mountain forests, indicating instead a pattern of past isolation and ongoing diversification. Our findings substantially add to understanding patterns of diversity in this region and lend weight to calls to use more sophisticated biodiversity assessments when setting regional conservation and research funding priorities.

AB Site-to-site variation in community composition, or beta diversity, is a major component of regional diversity. While many mechanisms, such as dispersal limitation and habitat heterogeneity, have been shown to affect beta diversity, interactions between habitat heterogeneity and environmental fluctuation have not been thoroughly investigated. This study uses leaf-colonizing (epiphyllous) bryophyte communities as a model system to investigate the effects of microclimate fluctuation on beta diversity. I hypothesized that beta diversity would increase with increasing microclimate fluctuation, as niche breadth of species was reduced with increasing fluctuation. A total of 354 leaf-colonizing bryophyte communities from 18 sites on the island of Moorea, French Polynesia were collected and identified. At each site, temperature and relative humidity were measured and converted to vapor pressure deficit (VPD). My analyses showed that beta diversity among communities on different host types tended to increase with the increasing daily range of VPD at a given site. It is possible that high fluctuation in microclimate conditions augments the differences in habitat quality among host types, resulting in greater dissimilarities among epiphyllous communities. However, host niche breadths of major epiphyllous species did not decrease with increasing VPD range. Overall, the results suggest that beta diversity may increase with environmental fluctuation, but it is not likely to be the results of reduced niche breadth as theoretically suspected.

AB Continually flowering plants bloom continuously throughout the year, as often seen in plants distributed along the roadsides or in the understory layers in Southeast Asia's tropical rain forests. Dillenia suffruticosa (Griff. ex Hook. f. & Thomson) Martelli (Dilleniaceae) is one such continually flowering shrub that flowers during periods of community-wide mass flowering, general flowering (GF), and non-GF. During irregularly occurring GF periods, when species of all forest layers flower synchronously for several months, some pollinators migrate to the canopy layer, where GF promotes the pollination success of participating plants. Continually flowering plants share the available pollinator community with GF plants, and the reproductive success of continually flowering plants may be affected during the GF period. To assess the effects of GF on the reproductive success of a diverse range of continually flowering plants, we examined the differences in pollinator density and reproductive success between GF and non-GF periods in D.suffruticosa at four different research sites. Although the seed set differed among the four research sites, pollinator density and fruit set did not differ between GF and non-GF periods or research sites. Our results suggest that the reproductive success of D.suffruticosa was maintained at an approximately constant level, regardless of the flowering phenology of the canopy layer or other vegetation components.

AB We report on findings from a common garden experiment showing that the magnitude of change in the production of phenolic compounds in response to different amounts of light availability is tissue-specific in saplings of big-leaf mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla). Moreover, we show that trade-offs between growth and the production of chemical defenses emerge only under light-limited conditions. These findings emphasize the need for considering the specificity of plant defensive responses to resource availability, as well as the influence of the abiotic environment (via trade-offs) on plant defense allocation patterns.

AB Arthropod abundance and diversity are remarkable in tropical forests, but are also spatially patchy. This has been attributed either to resources, predators, abiotic conditions or disturbances, but whether such factors may simultaneously shape arthropod assemblage structure is little known. We used cockroaches to test for multiple environmental controls on assemblage structure in 25km2 of Amazonian forest. We performed nocturnal, direct searches for cockroaches in 30 plots (250mx2m) during two seasons, and gathered data on biotic and abiotic factors from previous studies. Cockroach abundance increased with dry litter mass, a measure of resource amount, while species richness increased with litter phosphorus content, a measure of resource availability. Cockroach abundance and species richness decreased with ant relative abundance. Cockroach species composition changed along the gradient of: (1) soil clay content, which correlates with a broad differentiation between flood-prone and non-flooded forest; (2) soil relative moisture, consistent with known interspecific variation in desiccation tolerance; and (3) according to the abundance of ants, a potential predator. Turnover in species composition was correlated with abiotic conditionssorting species according to physiological requirements and to disturbance-related life history traitsand to ants' selective pressure. Cockroach abundance, diversity, and composition seem to be controlled by distinct sets of environmental factors, but predators which were represented by ants, emerged as a common factor underlying cockroach distribution. Such patterns of community structure may have been previously overlooked by undue focus on single or a few factors, and may be common to tropical forest arthropods.

AB Local niche-based processes and dispersal are important determinants of assemblage composition and species diversity. However, there is no consensus about the relative importance of niche and spatial processes to explain the distribution of anuran species in tropical systems. In our study, we analyzed the niche and neutral effects on anuran assemblages and found that biotic interactions were a predictor of assemblage structure. The Eltonian concept of niche was the best predictor for the structure of aquatic-breeding anuran assemblages, as species tended to co-occur more often than would be expected by chance. We suggest that the lack of environmental effect could be explained by differences in the pattern of movement between arboreal and non-arboreal anurans. Once there is a reduction in the number of arboreal anurans in open areas, the importance of habitat heterogeneity to explain assemblage composition should decrease. The lack of correlation between the spatial component in our model and species composition is evidence that spatial processes, such as migration, did not play a major role in structuring local assemblages. Anurans are generally assumed as having poor dispersal ability, yet this assumption is not true for all anuran species. We suggest that future studies should include key behavioral traits, such as site fidelity and homing behavior, as these traits can represent the dispersal abilities of anurans and dispersal ability seems to be important when we try to predict patterns of anuran distribution.

AB Vast areas of tropical evergreen forests have been selectively logged in the past, and many areas continue to be logged. The impacts of such logging on amphibians are poorly understood. I examined the response of anuran communities to historical selective logging in a wet evergreen forest in south India. Anuran assemblages in unlogged forest were compared with assemblages in selectively logged forest. Forty 10mx10m quadrats in forest, riparian zones, and streams of unlogged and selectively logged forests were searched at night for anurans. Species richness did not appear to be affected by logging. However, anuran density varied significantly and was 42 percent lower in selectively logged forests compared to unlogged forests. Anuran densities also varied significantly across microhabitats, with highest densities in streams of both selectively logged and unlogged forests. Patterns of niche overlap varied with selective logging as niche breadth either expanded, contracted, or remained neutral for different species. Ordination analysis explained 95 percent of the variation in species assemblage across selectively logged and unlogged forests. The assemblage in selectively logged forest was nested within unlogged forest. Among the habitat characteristics, litter thickness and water depth had the highest influence on the assemblage. This was followed by litter/water temperature, air temperature, and lastly relative humidity. It appears that species richness and composition of anurans in selectively logged forests is converging with unlogged forests, but the effects of historical logging seem to persist on anuran densities and their niche characteristics even ca 40yr since logging ceased.

AB Shade coffee plantations are considered important habitats for frugivorous bats. However, it is not known if bats use this agricultural habitat for shelter, food resources, or both. This study addresses these questions using the highland yellow-shouldered bat (Sturnira hondurensis) as an example. Twenty-six adult individuals of S.hondurensis were captured, 50 percent in tropical montane cloud forest (TMCF) and 50 percent in shade coffee plantations (SCP) in Veracruz, Mexico, and each was fitted with a radio transmitter for locating roosts and feeding areas. Data were obtained from 24 of them. The fieldwork was conducted between October 2010 and October 2011 covering all seasons. Twenty-two day roosts were located in the cavities of twelve different species of tree. Roosts located in TMCF differed significantly from those in SCP, having a smaller crown area and a greater species richness and density of plants around the roost. In SCP, both the average home range and the average core use area were smaller than in TMCF, but the differences were not statistically significant. Distances travelled by bats were generally longer and more variable in the SCP; the distance between capture site and foraging site was significantly greater in SCP than in TMCF. In SCP, there were fewer understory chiropterochorous plants, which are the main item in the diet of this bat and many other sympatric species of frugivorous bats. Although S.hondurensis does use roosts and foraging sites in the SCP, it is important to note that this species and others with similar requirements primarily depend on the preservation of intact forest adjacent to modified landscapes, where roosts and fruit are constantly available in abundance. Management practices should guarantee a greater density and diverse of trees and the preservation of understory plants with fruits in the coffee plantations that allow a long-term survival of frugivorous bats populations.

AB Ecological processes in tropical forests are being affected at unprecedented rates by human activities. Yet, the continuity of ecological functions like seed dispersal is crucial for forest regeneration. It thus becomes increasingly urgent to be able to rapidly assess the health status of these processes in order to take appropriate management measures. We tested a method to rapidly evaluate seed removal rates on two animal-dispersed tree species, Virola kwatae and V.michelii (Myristicaceae), at three sites in French Guiana with increasing levels of anthropogenic disturbance. We counted fallen fruits, fruit valves, and seeds of each focal fruiting tree in a single 1m2 quadrat, and calculated two indices: the proportion of seeds removed and the proportion of fruits opened by mammals. They both provide an indirect and rapid assessment of frugivore activity. Our results showed a significant decrease in the proportion of removed seeds (16%) and fruits opened (19%) at the most impacted site in comparison with the other two sites (79% for seeds, 60% and 35% for fruits). This testifies to an increased impoverishment of the primate and toucan communities at the disturbed sites. This standardized protocol provides fast information about the health status of the community of seed dispersers and predators and of their seed removal services. It is time- and cost-effective and is not species-specific, allowing comparisons among sites or over time. We suggest using it with the pantropical Myristicaceae and any other capsule-producing family to rapidly assess the health status of seed removal processes across the tropics.

AB Understanding the spatial variability in plant litter processes is essential for accurate comprehension of biogeochemical cycles and ecosystem function. We assessed spatial patterns in litter processes from local to regional scales, at sites throughout the wet tropical rain forests of northern Australia. We aimed to determine the controls (e. g., climate, soil, plant community composition) on annual litter standing crop, annual litterfall rate and in situ leaf litter decomposability. The level of spatial variance in these components, and leaf litter N, P, Ca, lignin, alpha-cellulose and total phenolics, was determined from within the scale of subregion, to site (1 km transects) to local/plot (similar to 30 m(2)). Overall, standing crop was modeled with litterfall and its chemical composition, in situ decomposability, soil Na, and topography (r(2) = 0.69, 36 plots). Litterfall was most closely aligned with plant species richness and stem density (negative correlation); leaf decomposability with leaf-P and lignin, soil Na, and dry season moisture (r(2) = 0.89, 40 plots). The predominant scale of variability in litterfall rates was local (plot), while litter standing crop and alpha-cellulose variability was more evenly distributed across spatial scales. Litter decomposability, N, P and phenolics were more aligned with subregional differences. Leaf litter C, lignin and Ca varied most at the site level, suggesting more local controls. We show that variability in litter quality and decomposability are more easily accounted for spatially than litterfall rates, which vary widely over short distances possibly in response to idiosyncratic patterns of disturbance.

AB Areas of locally intense and frequent grazing, or 'hotspots', are pervasive features in tropical grasslands and savannas. In some ecosystems, hotspot presence is clearly associated with edaphic factors (e. g., high clay content and elevated soil fertility), such as those that develop in abandoned cattle bomas. Studies in a range of other savanna ecosystems, however, have failed to find intrinsic soil differences between hotspots and the surrounding matrix. Also, it remains unclear to what extent hotspots are associated with specific assemblages of nutrient-rich plant species, as opposed to being a manifestation of intraspecific variation in nutritive quality. We conducted simultaneous studies in Kruger (South Africa) and Serengeti (Tanzania) National Parks to re-evaluate the role of edaphic correlates of hotspot occurrence and to test whether intraspecific variation in plant quality occurs across hotspot-matrix boundaries. We sampled soils and plants in paired hotspot and matrix plots at multiple sites within each ecosystem to test our a priori hypothesis that hotspots would be associated with distinct species assemblages and differences in soil fertility. We found clear hotspot-matrix differences in foliar N, particularly within species, despite finding no differences in any soil or plant-soil variables, including N mineralization potential and mycorrhizal inoculation levels. We found only weak differences in community composition across the boundary, suggesting that intraspecific variation in foliar N rather than species turnover is mainly responsible for the enhanced nutritive value of hotspot vegetation. We propose that grazer-plant interactions may be stronger drivers of hotspot maintenance in these systems than plant-soil interactions.

AB Amazonian forests harbor a large variety of understory herbs adapted to areas with different hydrological conditions, ranging from well-drained to seasonally flooded forests. The presence versus absence of flooding forms the extremes of a hydrological gradient, with various intermediate conditions, such as seasonal soil waterlogged areas, in between. We investigated the relationship between understory herbs and hydrological conditions in Central Amazonian forests using eighty-eight 250 9 2 m plots distributed along a 600-km transect. Hydrological conditions were determined regionally by precipitation and locally by topographic conditions based on drainage potential, flooding height and soil permeability (sand content). Soil cation concentration was used as a proxy for soil fertility. The floristic dissimilarities among plots were visualized by Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling, and simple and multiple regressions were used to identify the best predictor of herb species composition. Local drainage potential was more important in determining herb species composition than soil fertility or precipitation at non-flooded and flooded sites. Flooded sites comprised a very distinctive herb species composition even when the flood height was low (0.3 m). We conclude that hydrological conditions are the primary constraint of herb distribution within this flat regional landscape with moderate amounts of soil fertility variation (0.09-2.280 cmol(+)/kg). Hydrological models that consider local water conditions explained the largest part of herb species composition. Therefore, predictions of species distribution based on large-scale climatic variables may underestimate the favorable area for understory herbs if the variation on local hydrological conditions is not considered.

AB The seedling stage is generally the most important bottleneck for the successful regeneration of trees in forests. The traits of seedlings, particularly biomass allocation and root traits, are more easily quantified than the traits of adults. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that seedling traits vary and trade-off tracking the changing environment during secondary succession. We measured the major morphological traits of 27 dominant species and the major environmental factors in a chronosequence (30-yr-old fallow, 60-yr-old fallow, and old growth forest) after shifting cultivation in a tropical lowland rain forest on Hainan Island, China. The 30-yr-old fallow had higher light and nutrient availability, and the older forests had higher soil water content. Redundancy analysis based on species abundance and environmental factors revealed groups of seedlings that dominate in different stages of succession. Seedlings in different stages of succession had different strategies of biomass allocation for harvesting resources that varied in availability. Species characteristic of younger forest had higher allocation to roots and higher specific leaf area, while species characteristic of older forest had higher allocation to leaves. Our study suggests that the variations and trade-offs in the major functional traits of tree seedlings among successional classes may reflect changes in environmental conditions during succession.

AB We conducted a year-long field experiment to investigate how nitrogen addition affected decomposition of Piscidia piscipula and Gymnopodium floribundum along a precipitation gradient in the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico. Nitrogen addition did not affect decomposition rates at the drier sites. However, fertilization at the wettest site increased the decomposition of Gymnopodium litter and decreased the decomposition of Piscidia litter. Water-soluble carbon and lignin, and water-soluble carbon and nitrogen concentrations were the best predictors of decomposition for Gymnopodium and Piscidia litters, respectively. We conclude that the effects of nitrogen addition on decomposition will vary from site to site as a function of mean annual precipitation, inherent soil fertility, and species identity.

AB Information on genetic variation and its distribution in tropical plant populations relies mainly on studies of ground-rooted species, while genetic information of epiphytic plants is still limited. Particularly, the effect of forest successional condition on genetic diversity and structure of epiphytes is scanty in the literature. We evaluated the genetic variation and spatial genetic structure of the epiphytic bromeliad Guzmania monostachia (Bromeliaceae, Tillandsioideae) in montane secondary forest patches in Costa Rica. The sampling design included plants on the same trees (i.e., populations), populations within forest patches and patches within secondary forest at two different successional stages (early vs. mid-succession). Six microsatellites revealed low levels of population genetic variation (A = 2.06, A(E) = 1.61, H-E = 0.348), a marked deficiency of heterozygotes (H-O = 0.031) and high inbreeding (f = 0.908). Genetic differentiation was negligible among populations within the same forest patch, but moderate (G(ST) = 0.123 +/- 0.043) among forest patches. Genetic relatedness between individuals was significantly higher for plants located within the same forest patch and separated by <60 m and decreased as distance between plants increased, becoming significantly negative at distances >400 m. An analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) showed significant genetic variation between forest patches, but non-significant variation between successional stages. The selfing breeding system and limited seed dispersal capabilities in G. monostachia could explain the observed levels and partitioning of genetic diversity at this geographic scale. However, these results also suggest that forest fragmentation is likely to influence the degree of local genetic structuring of epiphytic plants by limiting gene flow.

AB Pollinator morphology can play an important role in structuring plant-pollinator relationships and a pollinator's morphology may be associated with aspects of its diet. We examined the relationship between morphology and the partitioning of flower-based food resources for five species of flower-visiting Cuban bats: Artibeus jamaicensis, Brachyphylla nana, Erophylla sezekorni, Monophyllus redmani and Phyllonycteris poeyi. We analyzed cranial traits and body size to assess differences among species with respect to morphological specializations. We also collected dietary data from guano and used acoustic monitoring to assess bat activity at flowers. We found evidence that bats partition floral resources, but we found no direct evidence that plants were limiting resources for the bats. Morphological similarity among bat species did not predict dietary overlap. Rather it was associated with phylogenic relationships among some species. Species with different morphological specialization for flower-visiting consumed resources and visited food plants at different frequencies.

AB In this study, we investigated the termites of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, one of the most threatened biodiversity hotspots in the world, in regularly spaced sites from 7 degrees S to 27 degrees S latitude. To our knowledge, this is the only report of a latitudinal survey of termites at species level performed with a standardized sampling protocol. We evaluate termite diversity and abundance, and describe patterns of species composition based on feeding groups along the latitudinal gradient. We also describe the relative contribution of environmental variables to explain diversity patterns. Termite assemblages were investigated by standardized surveys at 15 Atlantic Forest sites, on six transects divided into five sections of 10 m(2), with 30 sections per site (or 300 m(2)/site), which were investigated by one trained person for one hour. Observed species richness and abundance were negatively correlated with latitude. The influence of latitude was explained mainly by variables related to temperature, precipitation and ambient energy (potential evapotranspiration). Our results also suggest that temperature exerts a greater constraint on Atlantic Forest termites than productivity, because ambient productivity increases with latitude in this forest but termite diversity decreases. Termite species richness in the Atlantic Forest showed a different pattern than those described for other organisms, increasing in diversity where the coastal-forest strip narrows. Overall, our results indicate comparatively high termite species richness at northeastern sites and a significant impoverishment of termite assemblages in the southeastern and southern regions of the Atlantic Forest.

AB We evaluated puma (Puma concolor) feeding patterns in southeastern Brazilian agricultural landscapes using carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analyses of hair collected from fecal samples (N = 64). We classified the samples into three groups: feeding patterns based on forest remnants, on the agricultural matrix or both. We observed a predominance of consumption of C-3 prey (similar to 47% of individuals) in the area with the highest proportion of forest coverage. Conversely, C-4 prey were highly consumed (similar to 40% of individuals) where the agricultural matrix was predominant. The delta C-13 values for pumas in both areas indicated that their food resources come from both forest remnants and the agricultural matrix and that some individuals preferentially consumed C4 prey, indicating that food resources from the agricultural matrix make up most of their diet (similar to 46% of prey individuals). The wide range of puma's delta N-15 values in both areas indicated a diet based on different types of prey. However, the C-4 group had higher values, indicating that both pumas and their prey feed on enriched resources from the agricultural matrix. The results confirm the high behavioral plasticity of pumas in using highly anthropogenic habitats. The stable isotope analyses conducted in this study yielded new information on large carnivore trophic ecology that might be useful in the development of new conservation strategies in disturbed areas.

AB Core areas represent small regions within animal home-ranges intensively used during a given period of time. We assessed the quality of core areas relative to the rest of the home-ranges (i.e., non-core areas) of 11 groups of the territorial and highly frugivorous white-handed gibbon (Hylobates lar) over a short-time scale to reflect temporarily available resources. Weekly core areas included consistently higher densities of the gibbons' important foods compared to non-core areas. Gibbon core areas partially overlapped at 46 percent with a model comprising the best hypothetical core areas based on a concentration map of available food sources. In addition, a maximization ratio estimated by dividing the cumulative dbh covered by gibbon core areas and the model reached an intermediate value. Gibbon core areas only partially mirrored food distribution probably because they represent a trade-off between covering regions with important food locations and areas needed for other biologically relevant activities such as territory defense. Results do not support the concept that core areas can represent the minimum area requirement that would allow a gibbon group to survive and reproduce successfully irrespective of the time period considered, which indicates that core areas alone should not be treated as a conservation target.

AB Large hydroelectric dams are one of the current drivers of habitat loss across Amazonian forests. We investigated how the primate community at a hydroelectric dam in Brazilian Amazonia responded to changes in the landscape and local habitat structure of land-bridge islands after 21 yr of post-isolation history. The Balbina Dam, constructed in 1986, inundated 3129 km(2) of primary forests and created more than 3500 variable-sized islands. We conducted primate and habitat structure surveys on 20 islands from 5 to 1815 ha, and extracted forest patch and landscape metrics for each island. The number of primate species per island varied between 0 and 7 species. Primate composition varied substantially according to both island area and forest cover remaining within the landscape, whereas island area alone was the most significant predictor of richness. Locally, tree density and vertical stratification were the most significant explanatory variables of primate composition and richness. A model containing area effects had the most explanatory power regarding site occupancy for most species. Individually, each species responded differently, with howler and brown capuchin monkeys showing greater tolerance to cope with habitat changes. Body size was also an important predictor of primate occupancy. We recommend protecting large fragments and enhancing the suitability of surrounding habitats to ensure primate conservation in most Neotropical fragmented landscapes. Given the flat topography of hydroelectric reservoirs, which mainly favors the formation of small islands, and the escalating hydropower development plans in Amazonia, our findings provide evidence for pervasive detrimental impacts of dams on primate communities.

AB Our understanding of geographic patterns of species diversity and the underlying mechanisms is increasing rapidly, whereas the temporal variation in these patterns remains poorly understood. We examined the seasonal species richness and species turnover patterns of non-volant small mammals along three subtropical elevational gradients in southwest China. Small mammal diversity was surveyed in two seasons (early wet season and late wet season) using a standardized sampling protocol. The comparison of species richness patterns between two seasons indicated a temporal component in magnitude and shape, with species richness at high elevations clearly increased during the late wet season. Species richness demonstrated weak correlations with modelled temperature and precipitation. The elevational pattern of species turnover measured by Chao-Sorenson similarity index also changed seasonally, even though the temporal pattern varied with scale. Species turnover between neighboring elevations at high elevations was slower in the late wet season. Meanwhile, there was an acceleration of species turnover along the whole range of the gradient. The seasonal change in species diversity patterns may be due to population-level increases in abundance and elevational migration, whereas seasonal variation in factors other than temperature and precipitation may play a greater role in driving seasonal diversity patterns. Our study strongly supports the seasonality in elevational patterns of small mammal diversity in subtropical montane forests. Thus it is recommended that subsequent field surveys consider temporal sampling replicate for elevational diversity studies.

AB Insectivorous mammals are hypothesized to reduce the abundance of their insect prey. Using a 14-yr mammal exclusion experiment, we demonstrate for the first time that a widespread and abundant Neotropical mammalian insectivore (Tamandua: Tamandua mexicana) reduced Azteca ant abundance. Azteca ant nests inside mammal exclosures were significantly larger than nests in control plots, where tamanduas were more abundant. These top-down effects were caused not only by direct consumption, but also through non-trophic direct effects, specifically nest damage. In contrast, tamanduas appeared to exert no significant top-down effect on termite prey, which have strong chemical defenses. Our results are consistent with theory that strong defenses against predation can mitigate the top-down effects of predators on some prey species. We argue that predicting the degree of top-down effects caused by predators requires both a quantitative knowledge of prey choice and an understanding of the anti-predator defenses of prey.

AB When net deforestation declines in the tropics, attention will be drawn to the composition and structure of the retained, restored, invaded, and created forests. At that point, the seemingly inexorable trends toward increased intensities of exploitation and management will be recognized as having taken their tolls of biodiversity and other forest values. Celebrations when a country passes this 'forest transition' will then be tempered by realization that what has been accepted as 'forest' spans the gamut from short-rotation mono-clonal stands of genetically engineered trees to fully protected old growth natural forest. With management intensification, climate change, species introductions, landscape fragmentation, fire, and shifts in economics and governance, forests will vary along gradients of biodiversity, novelty of composition, stature, permanence, and the relative roles of natural and anthropogenic forces. Management intensity will increase with the increased availability of financial capital associated with economic globalization, scarcity of wood and other forest products, demand for biofuels, improved governance (e. g., security of property rights), improved accessibility, and technological innovations that lead to new markets for forest products. In a few places, the trend toward land-use intensification will be counterbalanced by recognition of the many benefits of natural and semi-natural forests, especially where forest-fate determiners are compensated for revenues foregone from not intensifying management. Land-use practices informed by research designed and conducted by embedded scientists will help minimize the tradeoffs between the financial profits from forest management and the benefits of retention of biodiversity and the full range of environmental services.

TI A Host Creates an Enemy-free Space for Mistletoes by Reducing Seed
   Predation Caused by a Woodboring Beetle: A Hypothesis

AB Parasitic plants rely on host plants for nutrition. The number of host species varies largely between groups, from single species or genus to hundreds of species. Relative abundance of the host and evolutionary history are the main requisites for parasitic plants to develop specificity to abundant hosts. In the present study, we suggest a novel mechanism by which a hemiparasitic mistletoe can develop local specificity mediated by its host. First, we describe a novel interaction in which a woodboring beetle (Hypothenemus obscurus) preys on mistletoe seeds (Psittacanthus plagiophyllus) attached to tree branches. This beetle preys more frequently on seeds deposited on branches of non-host species than on branches of its unique local host species (53 percent on average vs. 26 percent respectively). We hypothesize that local host specificity for this mistletoe could be partly mediated by beetle-host incompatibility, since the host offers a predation-free space in which mistletoes have better chances to grow. Furthermore, that the exceptional gum exudates produced by this unique host species minimize beetle attacks on branches, thus reducing predation of mistletoe seeds. This novel tritrophic interaction opens an avenue for research on macroscopic host-specificity mechanisms that occur at the level of the host bark and that have been poorly studied by plant ecologists.

AB Scatterhoarding by rodents, whereby seeds are collected and stored for later consumption, can result in seed dispersal. Seeds may be covered in litter on the forest floor (cached) or buried. This is particularly so in the Neotropics for large, nutritious seeds, and where primary dispersers are rare or missing. In African forests, contemporary anthropogenic pressures such as hunting, forest degradation, and fragmentation are contributing toward major declines in large frugivores, yet the potential for scatterhoarding to mitigate this loss is largely unknown. In this study, we used thread-marked seed to explore the balance between seed predation and dispersal by rodents in Afromontane forest. We studied two tree species in three habitats: (1) continuous forest; (2) continuous forest edge, and (3) small, degraded riparian forest patches. We found that seed removal rates were high and almost the same in all three habitats for both tree species, but that the predation/dispersal balance differed among habitats. In continuous forest, more seeds of each species were scatterhoarded than depredated, and rates of scatterhoarding differed between the two species. In all habitats, burying seeds up to 2cm belowground was more common than caching. Distances seeds were moved was approximately five times greater in continuous forest than in forest edge or riparian patches. We found strong evidence to suggest that the African pouched rat, Cricetomys sp. nov was responsible for the scatterhoarding.

AB Invasive plants can alter community dynamics and the successional trajectories of ecosystems they colonize. We explore how interactions between disturbance and invasion govern successional trajectories in the case of Casuarina equisetifolia invading lava flows on La Reunion Island. Surveys from 1972 and 1990 were compared with results of a survey in 2012 to detail progression of the invasion over time. General additive models were used to estimate the influence of altitude, distance to putative source of introduction, and lava flow age on the abundance of C.equisetifolia. Based on the predictions, we estimated the likely rate and eventual extent of spread of the species in the area through time. We placed our findings in the context of a conceptual model of successional processes in the area to highlight how the invasion of C.equisetifolia and natural and human-mediated disturbances are changing natural vegetation dynamics. The extent of invasion by C.equisetifolia has increased twentyfold over the past 40yr from 110ha in 1972 to 2373ha in 2012. Lava flows have facilitated this spread, and in turn C.equisetifolia has started to radically change successional trajectories, increasing the rate of succession sevenfold. The continued spread of this species poses a major threat to the small area of remaining native lowland rain forests on La Reunion Island, which cover <2 percent of their original extent.

AB Shaded coffee has been highlighted for its potential to conserve biodiversity, and thus perhaps also a diversity of natural enemies that could control pest organisms. In southwestern Ethiopia, coffee is grown in shade both in contiguous forests and in forest patches with native trees surrounded by open fields. We hypothesized that coffee grown in contiguous forests, which is the natural habitat for coffee (Coffea arabica) and its interacting organisms, would have less pest damage due to high protection by natural enemies. We surveyed pests on coffee plants in plots within contiguous forests (10 sites) and in forest patches (21 sites). In general, the variation in number of damaged or attacked leaves by individual insect or fungal pests was larger between plants than between plots, which suggests that very local conditions or processes are important. The spatial signals were generally weak. Coffee rust and coffee blotch miner tended to have lower infestation rates in accordance with our hypothesis, while fruit flies in ripe berries were more abundant in forest patches closer to contiguous forest. Based on interviews, olive baboons showed a clear dependency on contiguous forest habitat and were regarded as a problem only in contiguous forests and forest patches close to contiguous forests. In conclusion, we found no support for a generally stronger top-down control on coffee pests in sites within, or with connectivity to, contiguous moist afromontane forests in the native range of coffee.

AB The degree of interdependence among interacting species has major implications for our understanding of the coevolutionary process and biodiversity maintenance. However, the mutualism strength among fruiting plants and their seed dispersers remains poorly understood in tropical ecosystems. We evaluated simultaneously the effectiveness of the avian seed dispersers of the mistletoe Struthanthus flexicaulis (Loranthaceae) and the contribution of its fruits to their diets in a highland rocky savanna in southeastern Brazil. The mistletoe fruits are small lipid-rich pseudoberries available throughout the year. Four passerine birds fed on fruits, but Elaenia cristata (Tyrannidae) was the most effective disperser, responsible for more than 96 percent of the dispersed seeds. This bird swallowed fruits whole, expelling and depositing undamaged seeds by regurgitation and bill wiping on perches. From 646 dispersed seeds, 56 percent were deposited on safe sites, thin live twigs of 38 susceptible host species. Elaenia cristata were predominantly frugivorous, feeding on typically ornithocoric fruits of at least 12 species, but also on arthropods. Although fruits represented 75 percent of the feeding bouts along the year, S. flexicaulis fruits represented only 34 percent of the E. cristata diet. Our results highlight the asymmetrical nature of this mutualistic interaction, with the mistletoe life cycle locally linked to one highly effective seed disperser that is more weakly dependent on mistletoes fruits as a food source. We suggest that merging the seed dispersal effectiveness framework with diet assessment of seed dispersers is needed to clarify the asymmetries in mutualistic pairwise interactions involving plants and their animal partners.

AB Abstract
   Movement patterns of animals can vary dramatically as a function of their reproductive cycle or social structure; however, little is known about how changes in the social structure of dispersers affect patterns of seed dispersal. We examined the movement patterns of the forest-dwelling and cooperatively breeding Puff-throated Bulbul (Alophoixus pallidus) in relation to different stages of their reproductive cycle, time of day, and group size, to determine potential impacts on the shape and scale of dispersal curves generated using a combination of gut passage time and displacement distance data. There were significant differences in dispersal distances depending on group size, season (breeding, non-breeding), incubation (vs. other times of the year), and time of the day. The estimated median seed dispersal distance was 28 m. The median dispersal distances produced by birds in larger groups were longer than those of smaller groups (29 m vs. 25 m). During the breeding season, median dispersal distances were longer than during the non-breeding season (31 m vs. 25 m), but the median dispersal distances were significantly shorter during incubation than during outside incubation (24 m vs. 28 m). The median dispersal distance produced in the early morning (30 m) was also longer than that of other times of the day (23 m late morning, 28 m early afternoon, and 26 m late afternoon). This study suggests that various aspects of an animal's behavior are likely to have significant effects on seed shadows and that this may vary significantly even among individuals of the same species.

AB Abstract
   When tropical rain forest insect species are associated with a particular season or forest stratum, it can imply tolerance for heat and drought-or moisture dependence; attributes that may predict their responses to global climate change. In French Guiana (1995-1996), wood-boring cerambycid beetles made a seasonal shift in stratum. During the dry season, ground stratum bait branches were densely colonized, but during the rainy season almost all cerambycids emerged from canopy stratum branches. Because the same substrate was available at both levels, abiotic factors probably influenced branch selection. In this study, cerambycids were reared at the same site (2007-2008) to determine if the seasonal shift recurred. Microclimate data (temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed) were collected with portable weather meters to test the hypothesis that microclimate would be similar at ground stratum during the dry season, and at canopy stratum during the rainy season. The seasonal shift in stratum did recur; many cerambycid individuals (56%) belonged to species classified as 'seasonal shifters'. Temperatures in the preferred microhabitats were intermediate, but relative humidity remained high during the rainy season (regardless of stratum) and it was windier in the canopy (regardless of season). The shifters preferentially colonized branches at moderate mean temperatures (23.0-24.3 degrees C) and high mean relative humidities (91.3-100%). Shifters were considered season and stratum generalists because they were reared at both strata and were present in both seasons, but they may actually track a narrow microclimate window. Should the regional climate become warmer and drier, it would probably favor species currently restricted to the dry season or canopy stratum.

AB In Amazonia, the assemblages of several taxa differ significantly between upland terra firme and white-water flooded varzea forests, but little is known about the diversity and distribution of bats in these two forest types. We compare the spatio-temporal patterns of bat assemblage composition and structure in adjacent terra firme and varzea forests in the lower Purus River region of central Brazilian Amazonia. Bats were sampled using mist nets at five sites in each forest type during 40 nights (2400 net-hours). We captured 1069 bats representing 42 species and Phyllostomidae bats comprised 99.3 percent of all captures. The bat assemblages in varzea and terra firme forests were significantly different, mainly due to a marked dissimilarity in species composition and in the number of captures during high-water season. In addition, bat assemblages within forest types differed significantly between seasons for both terra firme and varzea. Frugivores dominated the bat assemblages in both forest types. Overall guild structure did not change between varzea and terra firme or between seasons, but frugivore and animalivore abundance increased significantly in varzea forest during the inundation. The difference in assemblage structure observed in the high-water season is probably caused by the annual varzea flooding, which provides an effective barrier to the persistence of many understory bats. We also hypothesize that some bat species may undertake seasonal movements between forest types in response to fruit abundance, and our results further underline the importance of floodplain habitats for the conservation of species in the Amazon.

AB Abstract
   We identified species- and community-level dietary characteristics for a species-rich Amazonian parrot assemblage to determine relationships among dietary metrics and use of geophagy sites. Previous studies suggest that soil is consumed at geophagy sites in this region mainly to supplement dietary sodium. We accumulated 1400 feeding records for 16 parrot species over 2 yr and found that seeds, flowers, and fruit pulp featured prominently in diets, while bark, insects, and lichen were consumed in small quantities. Food availability across 1819 trees was measured, and we found that flower availability was highest in the dry season and fruit production peaked in the wet season, but that phenology patterns of the 20 most commonly foraged plant species suggest no serious food bottlenecks. Partitioning of available food resources among the 13 most commonly encountered parrots is suggested by an ordination analysis (DCA), which placed the large macaws (Ara) with the Amazona parrots at the 'primary forest' end of a dietary resource axis and four smaller species at the 'successional forest' end of the axis. Parrot species associated with successional forest also consumed less plant species overall. Furthermore, these parrot species consuming successional forest resources had higher claylick visitation rates than those consuming primary forest resources suggesting they derive the greatest benefits from soil consumption.

AB Mangrove bird communities in north Australia comprise relatively few passerine species compared with other arboreal habitats in the region. Mangroves are dominated by a few tree species and there are potentially few resource axes available for partitioning by terrestrial birds. Competition for limited resources is predicted to cause strong niche differentiation and a highly structured, but low diversity, bird assemblage. Using multivariate and bipartite network analyses based on 1771 foraging observations (33% of 5320 behavioral observations), we examined resource partitioning by 20 terrestrial bird species in mangroves of north Australia. The mangrove bird community largely comprised generalist insectivores that partitioned insects by size with moderate-to-high interspecific overlap in diet. Gleaning for insects was the most common foraging mode. Few species specialized on nectar. Flowers of one or more mangrove species were available in every month of the year and insect abundance was correlated with flowering peaks. Niche differentiation by birds was determined by food type and foraging mode more than by broad spatial (mangrove zones) or temporal (seasonal) segregation of the use of resources. There was little evidence of bird species saturation or species sorting, suggesting loose species packing and a lesser role than expected for species interactions and interference competition in structuring the bird assemblage in mangroves.

AB Abstract
   The harvesting of non-timber forest products (NTFP) can influence the pattern of resource allocation in plants, affecting their growth, survival, and reproduction. However, only a small number of studies have addressed the impacts of NTFP harvesting on the reproductive phenology of the exploited species. The aim of this observational study was to assess the effects of harvesting and climatic variables on the reproductive phenology of Himatanthus drasticus, a highly exploited medicinal tree from the Brazilian savanna (Cerrado). We evaluated the effects of two different debarking levels (50 and 100%) in comparison to a control (no harvesting). We performed monthly counts of the number of buds, flowers in anthesis, unripe and ripe fruits in each sampled tree (intensity index), as well as the number of trees in each phenophase (activity index), over 2 yr. We used circular statistics tools to compare the effects of each treatment on flower and fruit production and to test whether the reproductive peaks were related to climatic variables. Both the activity and intensity indexes exhibited the same patterns; flower and fruit production were lower in the control, intermediate in the 50 percent debarking group and higher in the 100 percent debarking group. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of NTFP to demonstrate an increase in reproductive activity after several years of harvesting. All phenophases were positively correlated with higher temperature and precipitation, as it is common in the Cerrado.

AB Fragmentation is a major threat factor for plant-frugivore communities in tropical and subtropical forests. Resulting changes in the distribution of traits within these communities, e.g., a loss in large-bodied frugivores, may lead to strong changes in plant-frugivore interactions in fragmented forests. Yet, we still lack a thorough understanding of the interplay between forest fragmentation, the trait-composition of communities and resulting plant-frugivore interactions on a community-scale. In a fragmented South African landscape comprising different forest categories-i.e., continuous natural forest, forest fragments surrounded by natural grassland, and forest fragments surrounded by sugarcane-we investigated the relationship between communities of fruiting plants and their frugivore visitors in response to forest fragmentation, as well as the interactive effects of forest fragmentation and fruit size of the plants on the number of frugivore visitors and their body size. Neither the fruit size of plant nor the body mass of frugivore communities differed between natural forest sites and forest fragments. Moreover, in-depth analyses of frugivore assemblages visiting plant species revealed no effect of forest category on the number of frugivore visits or their mean body mass. The number of visits and body mass of frugivores were merely determined by the crop and fruit size of the focal plant species. Overall, our results suggest that frugivory of plant species with differently sized fruits was not reduced in forest fragments. Thus, fragments with high fruit availability may be key elements maintaining the functional connectivity of a heterogeneous forest landscape.

AB Large-scale modifications of natural ecosystems lead to mosaics of natural, semi-natural and intensively used habitats. To improve communication in conservation planning, managers and other stakeholders need spatially explicit projections at the landscape scale of future biodiversity under different land-use scenarios. For that purpose, we visualized the potential effect of five forest management scenarios on the avifauna of Kakamega Forest, western Kenya using different measures of bird diversity and GIS data. Future projections of bird diversity combined: (1) remotely sensed data on the spatial distribution of different forest management types; (2) field-based data on the biodiversity of birds in the different management types; and (3) forest management scenarios that took into account possible views of various stakeholder groups. Management scenarios based on the species richness of forest specialists were very informative, because they reflected differences in the proportions of near-natural forest types among the five scenarios. Projections based on community composition were even more meaningful, as they mirrored not only the proportions of near-natural forest types, but also their perimeter to area ratios. This highlights that it is important to differentiate effects of the total area of available habitat and the degree of habitat fragmentation, both for species richness and community composition. Furthermore, our study shows that an approach that combines land-use scenarios, remote sensing and field data on biodiversity can be used to visualize future biodiversity. As such, visualizations of alternative scenarios are valuable for successful communication about conservation planning considering different groups of stakeholders in species-rich tropical forests.

AB We describe the patterns of composition and abundance of tree species and their relationships to environmental factors in an area affected by the Jirau hydroelectric dam on the Madeira River in the Brazilian state of Rondonia. Trees were sampled in 20 1-ha forest plots distributed among areas affected and unaffected by the hydroelectric reservoir. Predictors of species distribution included in the analyses were soil fertility (sum of bases) and texture, slope, and the vertical distance from the nearest drainage. We sampled 8504 individuals belonging to 909 species/morphospecies. Floristic differences occurred throughout the reservoir area and between the sides of the river, and were strongly associated with edaphic and geological factors. The predictor with the greatest effect on the floristic changes was the sum of bases, coupled with the vertical distance from the nearest drainage, the latter reflecting the influence of the riparian zone. The forests sampled were heterogeneous and included transitional formations between unflooded terra firme and seasonally inundated (varzea, campinarana) forests. Although a considerable number of species (253) were restricted to plots affected by the reservoir, most of these species have a widespread distribution in the Amazon region. However, conservation measures are required in order to preserve species associations and ecosystems processes similar to those most affected by the reservoir such as the river floodplains. Our study reinforces the need to consider the heterogeneity of habitats affected by reservoirs when making decisions concerning the building of hydroelectric dams in the Amazon.

AB The Cerrado, the savanna biome in central Brazil, mostly comprised of woodland savanna, is experiencing intense and fast land use changes. To understand the changes in Cerrado carbon stocks, we present an overview of biomass distribution in different Cerrado vegetation types (i.e., grasslands, shrublands and forestlands). We surveyed 26 studies including 170 Cerrado sites. The grasslands presented mean total biomass of 24 Mg/ha, with 70 percent allocated in the belowground portion. In shrublands, the mean total biomass was 58 Mg/ha being 58 percent in the belowground portion. Finally, in forestlands the mean total biomass was 98 Mg/ha with 18 percent as belowground biomass. The surveyed studies presented 12 allometric equations for biomass estimate, most involving both diameter and height. Data on wood density for Cerrado shrubs and trees are not abundant and the average value was 0.66g/cm(3), similar to that found in the central portion of the Amazon Forest. We also examined the relationship between total precipitation and dry-season intensity with biomass variation in the Cerrado shrubland using data from tropical rainfall measurement mission (TRMM) for the period 2000-2010. Dry-season precipitation amount in cerrado areas in severe drought regions explained 29 percent of the variation in aboveground woody biomass. This finding is important in the face of the predictions of longer and more severe dry seasons in the region due to climate change.

AB Little is known about the effects of fire on the structure and species composition of Neotropical savanna seedling communities. Such effects are critical for predicting long-term changes in plant distribution patterns in these ecosystems. We quantified richness and density of seedlings within 144 plots of 1m(2) located along a topographic gradient in long-unburned (fire protected since 1983) and recently burned (September 2005) savannas in Brazil. These savannas differ in tree density and canopy cover. Sites along the gradient, however, did not differ in species composition prior to the fire. In recently burned savannas we also evaluated the contribution of vegetative reproduction relative to sexual reproduction by quantifying richness and density of root suckers. Finally, we tested seed tolerance to pulses of high temperaturessimilar to those occurring during fires on the soil surface and belowof five dominant savanna tree species. Seedlings were more abundant and diverse in unburned than in burned savannas. Seedling species composition differed among unburned and burned savannas probably reflecting early differences in root: shoot biomass allocation patterns. In recently burned savannas, root suckers were more abundant and diverse than seedlings. Relatively long exposures (>10min) of temperatures of 90 degrees C reduced seed germination in all studied species suggesting a negative effect of fire on germination of seeds located at or aboveground level. Because vegetative reproduction contributes more than sexual reproduction in burned environments, frequent fires are likely to cause major shifts in species composition of Neotropical savanna plant communities, favoring clonally produced recruits along tree density/topographic gradients.

AB The effects of reduced-impact logging (RIL) on the regeneration of commercial tree species were investigated, as long-term timber yields depend partly on the availability of seedlings in a managed forest. On four occasions during a 20-month period in the Tapajos National Forest (Eastern Amazon, Brazil), seven commercial tree species were assessed as follows: the long-lived pioneers Bagassa guianensis and Jacaranda copaia; the partially shade-tolerant Hymenaea courbaril, Dipteryx odorata, and Carapa guianensis; and the totally shade-tolerant Symphonia globulifera and Manilkara huberi. In 2439 10x10m plots, all individuals < 20cm diameter at breast height (dbh) were assessed over three intervals, before, during, and after the forest being logged. Before logging, the density of seedlings and saplings of the seven species did not change. Logged trees were spatially aggregated, with 9.2 percent of the plots being heavily impacted by logging. After logging, the recruitment rate increased more than the mortality rate, so that post-harvesting densities of seedlings and saplings increased. The increase in density was concentrated in logged plots with more disturbances. It is concluded that post-harvesting heterogeneity of micro-environments created by RIL may be an important component to be taken into account for sustainable forest management and conservation of commercial species.

AB The Asian orchid, Arundina graminifolia, has been introduced to many locations over the last 50yr, predominantly in South and Central America. A list of localities of A.graminifolia was compiled and used to model potential climatic niches based on the maximum entropy method. The differences are presented between niches occupied by native and invasive populations of A.graminifolia, and possible changes in the potential range of the species are discussed on the basis of various climate change scenarios. The coverage of habitats suitable for A.graminifolia will be reduced under future climate changes scenarios. The created niche distribution models indicated a more significant reduction in the potential ecological niches of the studied species in its invasive range. Nevertheless, areas with potentially suitable bioclimatic conditions for A.graminifolia should be monitored to prevent future uncontrolled invasion of the orchid into new habitats and to study its impact on the local ecosystems, as vast areas of its potential niche in the Americas are still unoccupied.

AB Concerns have been expressed that research methods and research infrastructure may affect the systems under study, which could lead to biased results. Effects of research activities on seedlings, saplings, and understory plants that are subjected to trampling and injury have been demonstrated. However, as of yet, no effects on epiphytic plants have been reported. In this paper, we demonstrate the impact of research trails on the abundance of an epiphytic tropical bromeliad, Guzmania vittata, at a research site in Peruvian Amazonia. Compared to the interior of the forest, the abundance of this bromeliad is significantly higher along the research trails. While we do not know the exact cause for the increased bromeliad abundance along the trails, we discuss enhanced dispersal of anemochorous seeds as a potential mechanism that generates this impact.

AB Many plant species have evolved special adaptations for acquiring nitrogen in nutrient-poor soils. In Brazilian savannas, the bromeliad Bromelia balansae (Bromeliaceae) is inhabited by mutualistic spiders (Psecas chapoda, Salticidae), which provide nutrients to the plant through their debris (feces, prey carcasses). In this study, we tested if bacteria present on the B. balansae phyllosphere improves plant nutrition and growth by mineralizing complex organic N compounds from spider debris that accumulate on the phyllosphere into simple compounds that may be absorbed easily by leaves. We conducted a greenhouse experiment by manipulating bacteria abundance on the bromeliad phyllosphere using antibiotics. Using isotopic mixed model equations, we demonstrated that debris from spiders contributed 10.71.9 percent (mean +/- standard error) of the N in bromeliads that had their bacterial abundance reduced. In contrast, spider feces contributed 27.1 +/- 4.4 percent of bromeliad N in the presence of the entire bacterial assemblage. These bromeliads accumulated 57 percent more soluble protein and grew 13 percent more than bromeliads that were grown under reduced bacterial density. These results highlight the importance of mineralizing bacteria on phyllosphere as a mechanism of N uptake by bromeliads.

AB Avian frugivores historically played important roles as seed dispersers across the Hawaiian Islands, but presently, the mao (Myadestes obscurus) is the only extant native frugivore in the wild on the Island of Hawaii. During recent decades, the introduced generalist Japanese White-eye (Zosterops japonicus) has become the most common bird in Hawaii. The movements of avian frugivores largely dictate how far seeds get dispersed and into what kinds of microhabitats. This study compares the movement patterns and diet of the mao to the Japanese White-eye to understand how a native differs from a non-native frugivore in the type and distances of seeds dispersed. Radiotelemetry was conducted on nine mao and nine Japanese White-eyes in a system of natural forest fragments (kpuka) created by lava flows. Japanese White-eyes disperse seeds approximately twice as far as mao; during the time of gut passage, mao move a mean distance of 98.1m, and Japanese White-eyes move 170.1-194.8m. However, the mao disperses the seeds of at least seven different native fruit species compared with two dispersed by Japanese White-eyes. Japanese White-eyes were found to disperse seeds smaller than 1.5mm, whereas the mao dispersed seeds up to 6mm in diameter. Despite their ecological differences, both birds distribute certain seeds within and among kpuka and likely facilitate primary succession of fruiting plants in the young lava matrix. However, this study suggests that if the mao were extirpated, a smaller-bodied generalist cannot entirely substitute for the ecological role played by the native frugivore.

AB Although differences in canopy openness, herbivory and their interaction may promote species coexistence, how these factors affect pioneer tree species and potentially limit growth, and survival has been poorly studied, particularly in tropical South Asia. We monitored the effect of canopy openness and herbivore damage on seedling survival and growth of 960 individuals of six pioneer tree species: Dillenia triquetra, Macaranga indica, Macaranga peltata, Schumacheria castaneifolia, Trema orientalis, and Wendlandia bicuspidata. Seedlings were placed in four gap-understory positionscenter, outer gap edge, inner forest edge, and understoryin four large, natural gaps within the Sinharaja World Heritage Reserve, Sri Lanka. Canopy openness positively affected survival probability beyond the 550-d experiment, while herbivory decreased survival and was highest in understory conditions. The relative order of species survival stayed fairly consistent between gap-understory positions and followed their known shade tolerance rankings. When averaged across all experimental conditions, T. orientalis had the lowest survival probability estimate beyond the 550-d experiment (0.05), but the greatest capacity for growth where it successfully established, while the species with highest averaged survival probability (0.79), D. triquetra, showed the lowest growth. One species, W. bicuspidata, responded positively to herbivory by re-sprouting. Coexistence of D. triquetra, T. orientalis, and W. bicuspidata can be explained by a trade-off among species in survival, growth, and response to herbivory. In addition to variation in canopy light environment, herbivory may be important in determining pioneer species distribution through fine-scale niche partitioning and should be carefully considered in reforestation efforts.

AB Lantana camara is a widespread exotic invasive species in India, capable of dominating and displacing native forage species. We investigated whether L. camara was associated with variation in elephant foraging behavior in Mudumalai Tiger Reserve, India. The behavioral responses of elephants to L. camara were assessed from feeding and stepping rates. Elephants were never observed to feed on L. camara, but rather fed on grass and browse present within and around L. camara patches. A multiple regression analysis showed that feeding rates were negatively associated with L. camara invasion (F-1,F- 55=4.26, R-2=0.07), but not stepping rates. Instead, grass cover and browse density were associated with stepping rates (F-2,F- 55=11.16, R-2=0.30). Path analysis indicated that the total effect of L. camara on feeding rates was 11 percent (=-0.24) less than the direct negative association (=-0.27) owing to a positive indirect association of L. camara with feeding rates through grass cover and browse density (=0.03), while stepping rates were negatively associated with grass cover (=-0.39) and positively associated with browse density (=0.38). Our results indicate that L. camara appears capable of modifying feeding rates of elephants, likely through a loss of grass areas due to L. camara invasion. Experimental work is needed to test for causal relationships among the variables we measured, to enhance our understanding of how invasive weeds modify elephant behavior.

AB Habitat destruction threatens biodiversity by reducing the amount of available resources and connectivity among geographic areas. For organisms living in fragmented habitats, population persistence may depend on dispersal, which maintains gene flow among fragments and can prevent inbreeding within them. It is centrally important to understand patterns of dispersal for bees living in fragmented areas given the importance of pollination systems and recently documented declines in bee populations. We used population and landscape genetic techniques to characterize patterns of dispersal over a large fragmented area in southern Costa Rica for the orchid bee species Euglossa championi. First, we estimated levels of genetic differentiation among forest fragments as (PT), an analog to the traditional summary statistic F-ST, as well as two statistics that may more adequately represent levels of differentiation, G'(ST) and D-est. Second, we used a Bayesian approach to determine the number and composition of genetic groups in our sample. Third we investigated how genetic differentiation changes with distance. Fourth, we determined the extent to which deforested areas restrict dispersal. Finally, we estimated the extent to which there were temporal differences in allele frequencies within the same forest fragments. Within years we found low levels of differentiation even over 80km, and no effect of land use type on level of genetic differentiation. However, we found significant genetic differentiation between years. Taken together our results suggest that there are high levels of gene flow over this geographic area, and that individuals show low site fidelity over time.

AB Knowledge of the recovery of insect communities after forest disturbance in tropical Africa is very limited. Here, fruit-feeding butterflies in a tropical rain forest at Kibale National Park, Uganda, were used as a model system to uncover how, and how fast, insect communities recover after forest disturbance. We trapped butterflies monthly along a successional gradient for one year. Traps were placed in intact primary forest compartments, heavily logged forest compartments with and without arboricide treatment approximately 43years ago, and in conifer-clearcut compartments, ranging from 9 to 19years of age. The species richness, total abundance, diversity, dominance, and similarity of the community composition of butterflies in the eight compartments were compared with uni- and multivariate statistics. A total of 16,728 individuals representing 88 species were trapped during the study. Butterfly species richness, abundance, and diversity did not show an increasing trend along the successional gradient but species richness and abundance peaked at intermediate stages. There was monthly variation in species richness, abundance, diversity and composition. Butterfly community structure differed significantly among the eight successional stages and only a marginal directional change along the successional gradient emerged. The greatest number of indicator species and intact forest interior specialists were found in one of the primary forests. Our results show that forest disturbance has a long-term impact on the recovery of butterfly species composition, emphasizing the value of intact primary forests for butterfly conservation.

AB We model Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) infection rates in Jamaican frogsone of the most threatened amphibian fauna in the world. The majority of species we surveyed were terrestrial direct-developing frogs or frogs that breed in tank bromeliads, rather than those that use permanent water bodies to breed. Thus, we were able to investigate the climatic correlates of Bd infection in a frog assemblage that does not rely on permanent water bodies. We sampled frogs for Bd across all of the major habitat types on the island, used machine learning algorithms to identify climatic variables that are correlated with infection rates, and extrapolated infection rates across the island. We compared the effectiveness of the machine learning algorithms for species distribution modeling in the context of our study, and found that infection rate rose quickly with precipitation in the driest month. Infection rates also increased with mean temperature in the warmest quarter until 22 degrees C, and remained relatively level thereafter. Both of these results are in accordance with previous studies of the physiology of Bd. Based on our environmental results, we suggest that frogs occupying high-precipitation habitats with cool rainy-season temperatures, though zcurrently experiencing low frequencies of infection, may experience an increase in infection rates as global warming increases temperatures in their habitat.

AB A central goal of ecology is to understand the mechanisms behind variation in the abundance of species. Food web theory predicts higher biomass for animals at lower trophic levels. However, some high trophic level species may reach great abundance via highly efficient foraging behaviors. We evaluated ecological and behavioral traits of the giant tropical ant Dinoponera australis related to these mechanisms. We determined its distribution and abundance, documented its foraging behavior, and measured its trophic position in a population at P.N. Iguazu, Argentina. We report that D.australis colonies are overdispersed, and the species reaches a wet biomass of more than 2.5kg/ha at this site. Dinoponera australis foraging behavior is characterized by route fidelity of individual workers, with different individuals specializing on different areas around the nest. Finally, stable isotopic evidence and direct observation suggest these ants are among the top predators in this terrestrial invertebrate community. We interpret our findings in the context of how the behavior of an abundant top predator creates an exception to the usual trade-off between biomass and trophic level. Together these data provide insight into the biology of one of the world's largest ants and why they may be able to attain such high densities where they occur.

AB Cocoa and coffee are among the most valuable tropical crops, with much of their production in areas of high biodiversity. Although this could suggest a conflict between agricultural expansion and biodiversity conservation, these crops are normally grown in shade plantationsa more biodiversity-friendly agroforestry system. Using SAo Tome Island as a case study, we examined if shade plantation can benefit biodiversity by protecting extinction-prone island endemic species. We found that shade plantations held rich assemblages, even in comparison with forest: we estimated 30 bird and 74 tree species occurring in plantations compared to 24 bird and 108 tree species in forests. However, the structure of the assemblages was significantly different between ecosystems, with an average dissimilarity of 33.8 percent and 87.9 percent for birds and trees, respectively. Shade plantations had consistently less endemic species than the forest; we estimated a drop from 17 to 13 in birds and from 17 to 3 in trees. We also found that despite marked differences in the response of bird species to the vegetation characteristics of shade plantations, there was a strong positive link between aboveground tree biomass and endemic species richness and abundance. These results show that shade plantations hold assemblages impoverished in endemic species, but that management can improve their value for the conservation of these species. Finally, we suggest that biodiversity-friendly certification and carbon markets are used to implement and guarantee the long-term economical sustainability of practices that favor the endemic species in SAo Tome's shade plantations.

AB Polyspecific associations are commonly observed in social animals, including primates, and have been interpreted as adaptations either to improve access to resources or to provide protection against predators. Mixed-species associations between Wied's marmosets (Callithrix kuhlii) and golden-headed lion tamarins (Leontopithecus chrysomelas) have been documented, and are unique among Atlantic forest primates. Both species are endemic to southern Bahia where part of the forest has been converted into cacao agroforests, which have been subjected to management intensification. Tree density and canopy connectivity decrease in more intensively managed agroforests, potentially increasing predation risk and the frequency of mixed-species groups between these primates. Here, we test this hypothesis using a standardized, large spatial-scale data set obtained from camera-trapping in 30 sites across an agroforestry landscape mosaic. As expected, the frequency of mixed-species groups increased in more intensively managed agroforests, but only relative to the total number of records of tamarins. Our results highlight that the benefits of mixed-species groups can be asymmetrical among species and variable across the landscape. They corroborate that predation avoidance is an important advantage of mixed-species groups in callitrichids, especially for conspicuous species living in smaller groups, such as the tamarin. Despite the importance of agroforests to conservation, our results indicate that management intensification can increase predation risk for species of conservation concern. To maintain the conservation value of agroforests, management practices should be planned to avoid any loss of canopy connectivity, taking into account the biodiversity vs. productivity trade-off associated with shade management.

AB We evaluated altitudinal segregation in two Sturnira species as a mechanism allowing their coexistence. Tests were devised to discern between interspecific interactions and regional responses to geographic and environmental variables, using extensive capture data from 18 montane rain forest sites. No significant correlation between captures was found. Additionally and according to the hypothesis of historical occupation of highland versus lowland forests, each species has shown specificity in their response to the geographical and environmental variables. Our results indicated that abundance patterns in these bats likely result from the regional distribution of each species rather than local interactions between them, a pattern that may have ancient roots within the group.

AB The presence of researchers from Western (i.e., developed world) institutions in Amazonia has frequently been contentious due to fears of scientific imperialism' or suspicions that they may be exerting undue influence over research agendas and knowledge production to the detriment of local researchers. Such negative perceptions are widespread, but not well substantiated. A more nuanced understanding of these issues requires information on who is conducting research in Amazonia and how knowledge production has changed over time. We performed a bibliometric analysis on Thomson Reuters'ISI Web of Science of all research articles about the Amazon published in three time periods: 1986-1989, 1996-1999, and 2006-2009. We found that the number of articles published and the diversity of countries involved in Amazonian research increased dramatically over the three time periods. The representation of several Amazonian countriesespecially Brazilincreased, while the proportion of articles without a single author from an Amazonian country also increased. The results indicate that the research capacity of Amazonian countries has increased, but that leadership of high-impact projects may still largely reside with researchers from developed countries.

AB The availability and quality of resources for herbivores in tropical dry forests (TDFs) vary in time and space, affecting herbivore guilds differently across spatial scales (both horizontally and vertically), with consequences to the distribution of leaf damage in these forests. We attempted to elucidate the distribution patterns of herbivorous insect guilds and leaf damage throughout the secondary succession and vertical stratification along the rainy season in a Brazilian TDF. With the advance of the succession, a greater richness and abundance of herbivorous insects were found, resulting in higher leaf damage in intermediate and late stages. This pattern, however, was not observed for the frequency of leaf miners. At a smaller spatial scale, the host tree height positively affected the richness and abundance of insects. The higher leaf damage was found in canopy, which also harbored a greater richness and abundance of chewing herbivores compared to the understory at both the beginning and the end of the rainy season. Although for sap-sucking insects, this was only true at the beginning of the season. We detected a decrease in insect richness and abundance at the end of the rainy season, probably due to a synchronization of insect activity with the availability of young, highly nutritious plant tissues. These results are consistent with other studies that found a general trend of increasing richness and abundance of herbivorous insects and leaf damage throughout the secondary succession (early to late stages) and between vertical strata (understory to canopy), suggesting that forest complexity positively affects herbivores.

AB Increased parasitism in animals in disturbed habitats is often understood to be the result of increased disease susceptibility due to low food availability resulting in nutritionally stressed and immunocompromised individuals. Such habitat change, however, might also lead to increased exposure to disease. In this article, we test measures of susceptibility and exposure to explain the prevalence and intensity of directly and indirectly transmitted helminths in black howler monkeys (Alouatta pigra) following a hurricane in Belize. None of these parasites were predicted by direct measures of susceptibility (as measured by fruit consumption and fecal cortisol levels). Rather, directly transmitted parasites (Trichuris sp. and strongylid type eggs.) were predicted by host density and group size, both measures of exposure. Similarly, only the consumption of Cecropia peltata, a fast growing pioneer that has a mutualistic relationship with ants predicted levels of the indirectly transmitted trematode Controrchis spp., also suggesting exposure. Cecropia peltata also increased in density post-hurricane, was high in digestible protein, sugar, and salt and eaten by monkeys more frequently than predicted based on distribution. These data suggest that in this hurricane-damaged forest the ingestion of this abundant and nutritious pioneer species increased exposure of the monkeys to Controrchis through ingestion of ant intermediate hosts. These results may point to a pattern true of pioneer species in general, leaving animals in disturbed forests with higher levels of parasitism as a result of changes to forest structure. As severe weather events are expected to increase, this suggests a cascading effect of climate change on ecosystem interactions and disease ecology.

AB The structure and dynamics of cyclone-prone tropical forests are driven in part by variation in tree species resistance to and survival after wind-induced structural damage. We determined the factors associated with tree damage and 3-yr survival following Category 5 Cyclone Olaf on the Polynesian island of Ta'u, American Samoa. Despite sustaining a high rate of severe damage (34.6% of all trees snapped, 23.0% uprooted), system resilience was high with 74.3 percent stem survival overall and an annual mortality rate of 7.9 percent compared with 2.1 percent in nearby undisturbed late successional forest. Three-yr survival rate of trees sustaining severe damage was 63.1 percent, compared to about 89 percent for trees sustaining only branch loss or defoliation. Three-yr survival differed according to damage type, 78.5 percent after snapping vs. 38.4 percent after uprooting. Species differed widely in resistance to and survival after snapping and uprooting. Several species and individual traits were associated with the probability of snapping or uprooting; however, wood density was the only species trait consistently, and negatively, associated with the probability of sustaining either damage type. Survival after snapping was negatively associated with the proportion of the tree snapped off, which was determined by individual tree architecture. Species growth rate was negatively associated with survival after uprooting, indicating the importance of shade tolerance for survival after uprooting. Thus, whereas species traits seemed to exclusively underpin resistance to and survival after uprooting, they only partly accounted for snapping resistance, and did not determine the intensity of snap damage or survival after snapping. Our results highlight the importance of considering each damage type separately when considering ecological trade-offs.

AB Despite the apparent dual role of elephant Loxodonta africana in shaping the food niches of large herbivores, empirical studies focus on their role in facilitating foraging opportunities, while declining resource opportunities (a necessary requirement for competition) are rarely quantified. Our study investigates the relative importance of elephant in these processes by quantifying potential browsing opportunities (using total and preferred biomass, between-bite distances and bite mass) for black rhinoceros Diceros bicornis along a gradient of elephant utilization in the succulent thickets of the Addo Elephant National Park, South Africa. We show that browse biomass and potential between-bite harvest rates initially increase with the intensity of elephant utilization through the formation and spread of elephant pathways in otherwise impenetrable thicket. At the maximum, modeled estimates of total and preferred biomass are on average 223 percent and 254 percent higher, respectively, than that recorded in the absence of elephant (Exclosures); potential between-bite harvest rates are 75 percent higher. With continued elephant utilization, however, browse biomass declines and between-bite distances increase as the pathways expand and coalesce and canopy height declines. Our model of the change in potential browsing opportunities for rhinoceros reflects the accumulated effects of elephant over time, i.e., the effects accumulate until the relationship switches from increased to reduced availability. With this we demonstrate the key role of elephant for rhinoceros foraging, linked to a potential loss of this role at higher levels of utilization.

AB Biodiversity conservation in managed tropical forests is becoming increasingly important as forest area continues to decline. Accordingly, there is growing interest in developing conservation-driven silvicultural prescriptions and identifying indicator habitat metrics (similar to indicator taxa) that could be easily assessed via routine vegetation sampling. Successfully achieving these goals, however, requires an understanding of how habitat characteristics affect biodiversity. The purpose of this study was to determine the associations between the species diversity of three taxa (ants, insectivorous bats, and dung beetles) and the habitat characteristics of hill dipterocarp production forests. We sampled both within (three samples) and adjacent to (six samples) six Virgin Jungle Reserves distributed throughout Peninsular Malaysia, and related habitat predictors to univariate diversity metrics (species richness and Shannon diversity) as well as multivariate compositional metrics. We found that influential predictors and directional effects differed across taxa. Ant diversity was most affected by stand density and canopy cover, and positively associated with both. Bat diversity was most strongly linked to primary forest area, with smaller reserves harboring greater bat diversity. Dung beetles were most affected by canopy cover and elevation, with greater diversity at lower elevation and with less canopy cover. Our multivariate analyses did not reveal any strong relationships between species composition and habitat variables. Overall, our results provide evidence that tropical forest structure is associated with biodiversity, but also suggest that it will be difficult to identify a single silvicultural prescription or landscape management strategy to maximize the diversity of all three taxa simultaneously.

AB Niche differentiation is a prominent mechanism for explaining tree species coexistence in tropical rain forests. Theory predicts that species that are specialized on a set of environmental conditions should competitively exclude generalists in those conditions, and that environmental heterogeneity allows the coexistence of many different species based on niche specialization. Yet, many tropical tree species of the family Dipterocarpaceae have broadly similar habitat preferences, with some occurring widely across several soil types. These soil generalists clearly persist despite the presence of other dipterocarp species that show clear soil specialization. We evaluate comparative seedling performance (growth and survival) of six Shorea species (Dipterocarpaceae) which differ in their adult tree habitat associations within the Sepilok Forest Reserve (Borneo, Malaysia). We tested the hypothesis that seedlings of species associated with a particular soil type perform better on that soil type than seedlings of soil generalist species, with generalists in turn performing better than specialists on a different soil type. We conducted a reciprocal transplant experiment including two soil types (alluvial and mudstone) and two light treatments (gap and understory). The soils differed in soil acidity, Al and P concentration. Observed species-specific differences in seedling responses to soil, light, and occasional flooding events could partially explain observed adult distribution, although not all species could be fully differentiated along these axes. Other trade-offs, such as investment in defense against herbivores and tolerance to soil waterlogging, may play additional roles in explaining coexistence of these species.

AB For many tropical plants, birds are the most important seed dispersers. Not all birds, however, will provide equally effective dispersal services. Behavioral differences, during and after feeding, can result in different establishment probabilities of new individuals. During 3yr, we examined species-specific quantitative and qualitative aspects of Guettarda viburnoides seed dispersal by avian frugivores, focusing on how these aspects modify seed dispersal effectiveness. Fruits of G.viburnoides were consumed by ten species of birds, two of which, Cyanocorax cyanomelas and Pteroglossus castanotis, removed 80 percent of the fruits. These two species differ in qualitative aspects of seed dispersal. First, they select for fruits of different sizes; C.cyanomelas feeds on larger fruits than P.castanotis, which results in the former dispersing larger endocarps than the latter. Second, they differ in their fruit handling treatment; C.cyanomelas are pulp consumers, whereas P.castanotis swallow the fruit whole, and are thus traditionally considered legitimate' dispersers. The probability of seedling emergence, the temporal pattern of emergence, the number of emerged seedlings per endocarp, and the probability of post-dispersal seed predation differs between endocarps dispersed by C.cyanomelas and P.castanotis; endocarps dispersed by the former have higher emergence probabilities, higher number of seedlings, faster emergence times, and lower predation probabilities than those dispersed by the latter. Finally, these birds differ in their landscape patterns of endocarp deposition; C.cyanomelas disperses endocarps to habitats with higher recruitment probabilities. Ultimately, the pulp consumer C.cyanomelas is a more effective disperser of G.viburnoides than P.castanotis.

AB Many members of the family Bromeliacae are able to adopt epiphytic lifestyles and colonize trees throughout the Neotropics. Bromeliacae do not extract nutrients from their hosts and confer relatively minor costs on their host plants. We suggest that bromeliads, however, may benefit their hosts by providing habitat for predators of host plant herbivores. We report a correlation between bromeliad presence and a reduction in herbivore damage in orange trees, an effect that is increased when bromeliads are colonized by ants. Our results may have important implications for agricultural systems in the Neotropics, where bromeliads are often removed in the belief they are parasitic. We instead demonstrate that bromeliads may impart a benefit to their hosts, and speculate that under particular circumstances they may be part of a three-species mutualism.

AB Endozoochory and fire are crucial ecological factors determining germination success and recruitment in many plant species. Fire is a well-known germination trigger while endozoochory may allow seed dispersal along with an increase in germination. Their interaction has rarely been addressed, however, even though both factors are pervasive in human-transformed ecosystems like most Neotropical Dry Forests (NDF). For three common Mesoamerican tree species (Acacia pennatula, Enterolobium cyclocarpum, and Guazuma ulmifolia), we used feeding trials to assess the preference of cattle, which are their main seed dispersal agent. We also experimentally tested the interaction between gut passage and fire as triggers of germination. The fruits of the three species were eaten by cattle, but the small seeds of G. ulmifolia were ingested 10-fold more than those of the other species. While gut passage did not have any effect on germination, heat-shocks above 90 degrees C increased the number of germinating seeds by 15 percent. These results suggest that cattle may be a key dispersal vector in NDF, but that fire may be an important germination trigger. Physical dormancy in these species may have been selected for by extinct megaherbivores because it was a key trait ensuring seed survival after gut passage. However, in light of the recent expansion of cattle-ranching and fire occurrence in NDF, it has become a useful exaptation facilitating the colonization of disturbed areas.

AB In the wet forests of Panama, El Nino typically brings a more prolonged and severe dry season. Interestingly, many trees and lianas that comprise the wet forests increase their productivity as a response to El Nino. Here, we quantify the abundance of migrating Marpesia chiron butterflies over 17yr and the production of new leaves of their hostplants over 9yr to test the generality of the El Nino migration syndrome, i.e., whether increased abundance of migrating insects and productivity of their food plants are associated with El Nino and La Nina events. We find that the quantity of M. chiron migrating across the Panama Canal was directly proportional to the sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly of the Pacific Ocean, which characterizes El Nino and La Nina events. We also find that production of new leaves by its larval host trees, namely Brosimum alicastrum, Artocarpus altilis, and Ficus citrifolia, was directly proportional to the SST anomaly, with greater leaf flushing occurring during the period of the annual butterfly migration that followed an El Nino event. Combining these and our previously published results for the migratory butterfly Aphrissa statira and its host lianas, we conclude that dry season rainfall and photosynthetically active radiation can serve as primary drivers of larval food production and insect population outbreaks in Neotropical wet forests, with drier years resulting in enhanced plant productivity and herbivore abundance.

AB The modeling of top predators' habitats and the understanding of their environmental requirements in landscapes facing high land-use transformation pressure have long-standing importance for the development of conservation strategies. Multi-distance spatial cluster analysis and logistic regression with environmental weighting for pseudo-absence designation were applied to understand spatial patterns of jaguar occurrence in Mato Grosso state (Central Western Brazil). This location has been under intense deforestation pressure since the 1970s and is historically one of the most important jaguar habitats in the world. By using a model of five independent variables, we were able to achieve a 73.2 percent success rate of case/non-case classification and indicate not only a general loss of habitat suitability, but also an increasing interruption of potential migration corridors in the state. Our analysis on a regional scale demonstrates the importance of forest and savannah woodland for jaguar habitat maintenance in the Mato Grosso state. The jaguar species demonstrates a sensitivity to landscape fragmentation, which can be parameterized for improved model building by metrics such as edge density and patch size. Comparisons with previous studies in South America show that parameter selection for jaguar habitat modeling is highly scale-dependent and that habitat suitability in partially transformed landscapes could be maintained if fragmentation is minimized. Recent land-use transformation, however, has significantly weakened the conservation status of the Pantanal-Amazon corridor.

AB In the Andean highlands, Polylepis woodlands are a rare and unique ecosystem of the treeline. Although human activities have caused the loss of extensive forested areas and decreased woodland regeneration, few systematic and quantitative assessments have been carried out in Polylepis forests. This study compares differences in habitat characteristics, population structure, and reproductive output in populations of Polylepis tomentella subject to different levels of human disturbance in the south-central Andes of Bolivia. We selected P. tomentella because the species still covers large extensions in the form of fragmented forest patches. Results show that human activities affected all the studied populations. Moderately disturbed populations exhibited a lower percentage of farmed area (0.6%) and browsed plants (4%) than strongly disturbed populations (5% and 12%, respectively). All populations exhibited similar proportion of plants with logging scars. Potassium content and canopy closure were 1.5 and 2.5 higher, respectively, in strongly disturbed populations. The density of saplings and seedlings were 75 percent and 80 percent lower in strongly disturbed populations than in moderately disturbed population, even though reproductive individuals produced twice more flowers and fruits. Our results suggest that fruit production does not limit regeneration of P. tomentella and post-dispersal mechanisms may decrease seed germination and increase seedling mortality. Overall, strongly disturbed populations will be less likely to regenerate, leading to population decline. Conservation programs should facilitate forest recovery by promoting seedling establishment, reducing overharvesting and over-browsing, and protecting remaining adult plants.

AB Frugivores and pollinators are two functional groups of animals that help ensure gene flow of plants among sites in landscapes under restoration and to accelerate restoration processes. Resource availability is postulated to be a key factor to structure animal communities using restoration sites, but it remains poorly studied. We expected that diverse forests with many plant growth forms that have less-seasonal phenological patterns will provide more resources for animals than forests with fewer plant growth forms and strongly seasonal phenological patterns. We studied forests where original plantings included high tree species diversity. We studied resource provision (richness and abundance of flowers and fruits) of all plant growth forms, in three restoration sites of different ages compared to a reference forest, investigating whether plant phenology changes with restoration process. We recorded phenological data for reproductive plant individuals (351 species) with monthly sampling over 2years, and found that flower and fruit production have been recovered after one decade of restoration, indicating resource provision for fauna. Our data suggest that a wide range of plant growth forms provides resource complementarities to those of planted tree species. Different flower phenologies between trees and non-trees seem to be more evident in a forest with high non-tree species diversity. We recommend examples of ideal species for planting, both at the time of initial planting and post-planting during enrichment. These management actions can minimize shortage and periods of resource scarcity for frugivorous and nectarivorous fauna, increasing probability of restoring ecological processes and sustainability in restoration sites.

AB Mutualisms are commonly threatened by parasites and cheaters: species that exploit the host-derived resources without providing an adequate service. Here, we summarize mechanisms for the stabilization of obligate defensive ant-plant mutualisms, a typical element of tropical lowland forests. Host plants exert partner choice and can sanction non-defending ants by shedding the domatia that serve as nesting space or ceasing the production of ant rewards. Hosts can also restrict the exploitation of the ant rewards by means of specific biochemical traits that decrease their quality for non-adapted generalist exploiters and, thus, convert them into exclusive rewards. Reward provisioning can even shift the competitive balance between mutualists and exploiters in favor of the mutualists. In turn, plant-ants show adaptations in their colony structure and changes in their digestive capacities that enhance their efficiency in the use of the host-derived resources. Founding queens use plant odors for host choice behavior, and ants not supplied with adequate amounts of EFN decrease their defensive service and thereby exert partner sanctions. Theoretical models and empirical research into mutualisms usually focus on actions that are taken by the host. Using ant-plants as model systems, we are now discovering the importance of contributions that come from the symbiont. This discovery indicates the potential for multiple reciprocal interactions between phenotypically plastic hosts and symbionts, which contribute significantly to what is still considered a miracle: the stability of mutualisms in the presence of exploiters.

AB Seed dispersal sets the stage for the suite of biotic and abiotic interactions that determine the fate of individual seeds. In this review, we first focus on how dispersal influences the seedscape', or the combination of abiotic and biotic factors that affect the probability of recruitment once a seed has reached its final location. We review recent papers that examine the effect of different dispersal vectors on (1) the quality of the habitat in which a seed lands; (2) the distance seeds are dispersed from the parent tree; and (3) the density and composition of plants within the neighborhood of a seed following deposition. Next, we explore methods used to scale these processes up to the level of populations. We highlight demographic models that integrate across multiple life history stages and predict the impact of dispersal in variable environments on population growth. We also review studies that analyze existing spatial patterns of trees within large forest plots and use various strategies to infer the processes that led to those patterns. We continue to scale up from populations to communities, and discuss approaches that have been taken to understand how dispersal may affect diversity and abundance in the community. We then turn to human disturbances and discuss the implications of frugivore defaunation for plant communities. We finish by highlighting several areas of research that are particularly promising for future directions of study.

AB Mature tropical forests sequester large quantities of atmospheric CO2, which they store as plant biomass. These forests are changing however, including an increase in liana abundance and biomass over recent decades in Neotropical forests. We ask here how this increase in lianas might impact the tropical forest carbon cycle and their capacity for carbon storage and sequestration. Lianas reduce tree growth, survival, and leaf productivity; however, lianas also invest significantly in leaf production, and the increase in lianas could conceivably offset liana-induced reductions in tree canopy productivity with no adverse effects to the forest-level canopy productivity. By contrast, lianas decrease the total ecosystem uptake of carbon by reducing tree biomass productivity. Lianas themselves invest little in woody biomass, and store and sequester only a small proportion of the biomass in tropical forests. As lianas increase they may effectively displace trees, but the greater liana carbon stocks are unlikely to compensate for liana-induced losses in net carbon sequestration and storage by trees. A potentially important additional consideration is the impact of lianas on the tree community. By competing more intensely with shade-tolerant, more densely wooded trees than with fast-growing, light-wooded trees, lianas may shift tree composition toward faster-growing species, which store relatively little carbon, and thereby further reduce the carbon storage capacity of tropical forests. Overall, current evidence indicates that the increase in lianas will negatively impact the carbon balance of tropical forests, with potentially far-reaching consequences for global atmospheric CO2 levels and associated climate change.

AB Plant biodiversity in the tropics is threatened by intense anthropogenic pressures. Deforestation, habitat degradation, habitat fragmentation, overexploitation, invasive species, pollution, global climate change, and the synergies among them have had a major impact on biodiversity. This review paper provides a brief, yet comprehensive and broad, overview of the main threats to tropical plant biodiversity and how they differ from threats in temperate regions. The Global Strategy for Plant Conservation, an international program with 16 global targets set for 2020 aimed at understanding, conserving, and using sustainably the world's plant biodiversity, is then used as a framework to explore efforts in assessing and managing tropical plant conservation in a changing world. Progress on 13 of the 16 outcome-oriented targets of the Strategy is explored at the pantropical scale. Within each target, I address current challenges in assessing and managing tropical plant biodiversity, identify key questions that should be addressed, and suggest ways for how these challenges might be overcome.

AB Tropical plantations are considered a viable option to sequester carbon on abandoned agricultural lands, but implications of tree species selection for overall greenhouse gas budgets on plantations have been little studied. During three wet seasons, we investigated the influence of nine tree species on soil pH, temperature (ST), bulk density (BD), moisture content water filled pore space (WFPS), and greenhouse gas fluxes in diverse forest sites and monoculture plantation plots. All sites were on clay-rich soils of the Barreiras formation, in east-central Amazonia, Brazil. We found that ST and BD were 0.6 degrees C and 0.2g/cm(3) higher in the plantation relative to the forest, and soil CH4, CO,(2) and N2O fluxes were, respectively, 38, 12, 62, percent lower in the plantation. Tree growth rates were highly variable on the plantation, with the mean comparable to the forest sites. Tree species identity mattered (P<0.01) for all soil properties and gas fluxes on the plantation, but only for pH, BD, WFPS, and N2O fluxes in the forest. The species rank order of pH and N2O fluxes in the forest, however, were unlike the plantation. Tree growth rates were a strong predictor for soil WFPS, and together with location, they also explained 75 percent of the mean N2O flux variation. Our study indicates that: (1) tree species influence soil processes; and (2) high tree growth and low soil gas emissions imply a reduced climate forcing effect from plantations, especially when planted with fast-growing legume species on abandoned farmland.

AB The roles of terrestrial molluscs in many important ecosystem processes are largely unknown, particularly in tropical forests. It has been suggested from studies in temperate forests that snails/slugs contribute to litter decomposition directly (by their own metabolism) and/or indirectly (by habitat modification enhancing micro-arthropod or microbial activity). Forty-two mesocosms were established at seven Hawaiian rain forest sites to examine the role of the five most abundant snail/slug species: the native Succinea cepulla, and the non-native Arion intermedius, Deroceras laeve, Oxychilus alliarius, and Limax maximus. Controls had no snails/slugs. To assess the contribution of each mollusc species separately, decomposition experiments were conducted in mesocosms containing litter bags and manipulated field densities of the mollusc species. Presence of molluscs increased litter decomposition rates, which were strongly correlated with mollusc biomass. While rates of release of some nutrients (C, K, Mg, and Mn) differed among treatments, multivariate analyses indicated that the different mollusc species influenced nutrient release in a similar way. No increases in smaller invertebrate abundances were observed in treatments containing molluscs, indicating that molluscs do not facilitate smaller invertebrate recruitment and probably influence these ecosystem processes primarily by microbe facilitation. If a major functional role of terrestrial molluscs is to facilitate microbial growth, then maintaining adequate mollusc biomass may be essential for maintaining healthy functioning ecosystems.

AB Regeneration dynamics in tropical forests are driven by many abiotic and biotic factors, including light availability, litter depth, and density-dependent interactions with enemies. Whether ontogenetic stage also can play a critical role, however, is seldom considered. We address how early-stage survival of two shade-tolerant species is affected by canopy openness, litter depth, ontogenetic stage, and conspecific neighborhood in the understories of secondary forest fragments in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We monitored the survival of naturally occurring early-stage individuals of one canopy and one understory tree species in six forest fragments for over 2yr. We then compared how different abiotic and biotic variables, as well as the initial height of seedlings and the length of time interval, influenced variation in survival using generalized linear mixed-effects models. Survival of the canopy species was negatively affected by light availability, while for the understory species increasing light availability either increased (for seedlings) or decreased (for saplings) survival. In addition, survival of both species at the seedling stage was positively related to litter depth. Finally, we found that conspecific neighbors were an important biotic factor reducing survival. Our results suggest different regeneration niches for these two tree species related to light availability. Moreover, we found that the effect of both abiotic factors depends on ontogenetic stage, a critical factor for understanding regeneration niches in the forest understory.

AB Recruitment limitation (seed limitation and establishment limitation) has been proposed to contribute to the maintenance of high diversity of plants in tropical forests. This hypothesis suggests that diversity is maintained by slowing down competitive exclusion. In this study we: (1) quantified the relative importance of seed limitation and establishment limitation on recruitment for 4-7 species, testing the impact of seed predators and competition; (2) evaluated the effect of recruitment limitation on the diversity of seedling communities: if recruitment limitation is a diversity-promoting mechanism, then removing the limitation should have a negative effect on diversity. To evaluate the magnitude and effects of recruitment limitation we used data from 400 seed traps, we executed seed addition experiments with and without vertebrate exclusion, and we conducted seedling transplant experiments during 2yr in an Amazonian rain forest in Colombia. On the basis of seed traps, we found that seed limitation was strong; however, seed addition experiments showed that establishment limitation is more important than seed limitation for recruitment in all species considered. The addition/transplant experiments did not affect diversity of the surrounding seedlings, lending no support to the theory that recruitment limitation affects diversity. Establishment limitation was stronger at the seed-seedling transition than in older seedling transitions, as shown by high survival in the seedling transplants experiment. We found that seed dispersal increases regenerating plant diversity, and that predation is an important factor affecting seed establishment. We highlight the role of animals in these processes and therefore in the maintenance of diversity in tropical rain forests.

AB We investigated the potential effects of an invasive alien Poaceae (Urochloa arrecta) on the abundance, richness, and composition of native macrophytes and fish. Samples were collected in patches of macrophytes dominated by the invasive species and in others dominated by a native macrophyte (Eichhornia azurea). We assessed the potential effects of these two species on macrophyte and fish abundance and richness, as well as in fish assemblage composition. The effects of both macrophytes did not differ when they were in similar, low biomasses. Consistent with our expectations, however, the abundance of native macrophytes and fish decreased with increasing U. arrecta biomass, and both assemblages were eliminated at the extreme high levels of biomass attained by this species. In contrast, E. azurea did not affect the assemblages because this native species never reached levels of biomass as high as those recorded for the invasive species. Competition for space and light most likely determines the elimination of macrophytes in patches that are extensively colonized by U. arrecta, whereas fish assemblages do not occupy these patches due most likely to the limited space available for movement and foraging. Thus, U. arrecta is a source of concern for biodiversity conservation because it has negative influences on both assemblages when it is well developed, which is true in the later stages of the invasion process.

AB Areas with shallow water tables comprise a significant portion of tropical forests and have distinct forest structure and plant-assemblage composition. It is not clear, however, how the water table regime shapes the distributions of other organisms. Here, we evaluated the influence of water-table level on ant-assemblage richness, abundance, and composition in a terra firme forest, in Central Amazonia. We sampled ants in ten 250m-long transects, regularly distributed over 5km(2) by extracting ants from 100 1-m(2) litter samples, 100 pitfall traps, and 100 sardine baits. During 1year, the water-table level in each transect was monitored every 15d with a 6-m deep dipwell. Overall the abundance of individuals and occurrence of species were lower in areas where the water table was closer to the surface (< 1m depth) for longer periods (similar to 5.5mo). The number of ant species, however, was higher in transects where the water table was close to the surface more frequently. Changes in number of species were mainly a result of an increase in generalist species associated with a decrease in the number of specialist predators and small hypogeic generalist foragers. Although disturbance by the water table may increase local alpha diversity, only one third of generalist species seems to prefer areas with shallow water table.

AB Temperature seasonality has been proposed to be an important determinant of bat community structure in Atlantic Forest of South America and elsewhere. I characterized spatial and environmental patterns of species richness of phyllostomid bats in Atlantic Forest of South America and examined the degree to which temperature seasonality relative to other important environmental gradients was related to patterns of diversity across 60 heterogeneously sampled assemblages. I compared efficacy of different methods of accounting for inventory completeness (rarefaction, species estimation, minimum number of individuals and raw data) in characterizing gradients of bat diversity. I also compared levels of spatial autocorrelation generated by these methods and the degree to which such autocorrelation influenced results of regression analyses. Temperature seasonality was consistently the most important predictor of species richness across all methods of accounting for inventory completeness as well as between spatial and non-spatial regression methods. Spatial autocorrelation of both species richness and regression residuals was lowest for species richness estimators and highest for data rarefied to the highest sample sizes. Strong and characteristic environmental gradients typifying Atlantic Forest of South America translate into coincident gradients of richness of bat assemblages. Although data were characterized by heterogeneous sampling efforts, relationships of species richness with seasonality of temperature were strong and easily detectable. Methods of accounting for inventory completeness improve assessment with species richness estimators performing better than rarefaction methods.

TI Litterfall and Element Fluxes in a Natural Hardwood Forest and a

AB Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata) is the most important forest plantation species in subtropical Asia and is rapidly replacing natural forests. Such land-use change may affect ecosystem nutrient cycling through changes in litterfall nutrient flux. Tropical cyclones often cause pulses of litterfall. Previous studies, however, have mostly focused on the effects of a single cyclone with little effort examining the effects of repeated cyclones. We examined litterfall in a natural hardwood forest and a Chinese-fir plantation in central Taiwan experiencing an average of one typhoon per year. The natural hardwood forest had 54 percent higher annual litterfall (11,400kg/ha/yr) than the Chinese-fir plantation (7400kg/ha/yr). Four typhoon-affected months (typhoon period) contributed to approximately 60 percent of the litterfall and litterfall element flux in the natural hardwood forest and 80 percent in the Chinese-fir plantation, with contributions from individual typhoons varied by more than twofold. Litterfall N and P concentrations were significantly higher in typhoon period than in non-typhoon period, likely the result of limited retranslocation. Precipitation was a better predictor of quantity of typhoon-associated litterfall than wind velocity. Both types of forests in southeastern China beyond the reach of typhoons have litterfall peaks in the dry season. In contrast, we measured higher litterfall during the typhoon period than during the dry season, suggesting that in regions with frequent cyclones, cyclones drive temporal variation of litterfall. Global climate change is affecting the frequency and intensity of cyclones; therefore, knowledge of typhoon-litterfall dynamics is indispensable for understanding the effects of climate change on ecosystem nutrient cycling.

AB Spatial and temporal patterns of seed rain impact plant fitness, genetic and demographic structure of plant populations, and species' interactions. Because plants are sessile, they rely on biotic and abiotic dispersal agents to move their seeds. The relative importance of these dispersal agents may shift throughout the year. In tropical forests, seed dispersal of epiphytes constitutes a major but hitherto unknown portion of seed rain ecology. For the first time, we report on patterns of seed rain for both epiphytic and terrestrial plants across an entire year in a Neotropical montane forest. To examine seed rain, we placed traps in the canopy and on the ground. We analyzed seed dispersal syndrome (bird, mammal, wind) and plant habit (epiphyte, liana, shrub, small tree, large tree) across all seasons of the year (dry, misty, wet). We found that the community of species collected in canopy traps was significantly different from the community in ground traps. Epiphytes were the most common plant habit found in canopy traps, while large trees were most common in ground traps. Species with bird-dispersed seeds dominated all traps. Species richness was significantly higher during the dry season in ground traps, but did not vary across seasons in canopy traps. Our results highlight the distinct seed rain found in the canopy and on the ground and underscore the importance of frugivores for dispersing both arboreal and terrestrial plants in tropical ecosystems.

AB Tropical arid to semi-arid ecosystems are nearly as diverse as more humid forests and occupy large parts of the tropics. In comparison, however, they are vastly understudied. For instance, fog precipitation alone supports a unique vegetation formation, locally termed lomas, on coastal mountains in the Peruvian desert. To effectively protect these highly endemic and threatened ecosystems, we must increase our understanding of their diversity patterns in relation to environmental factors. Consequently, we recorded all vascular species from 100 random 4x4m plots on the fog-exposed southern slope of the mountain Mongon. We used topographic and remotely sensed covariates in statistical models to generate spatial predictions of alpha diversity and plant species' distribution probabilities. Altitude was the most important predictor in all models and may represent fog moisture levels. Other significant covariates in the models most likely refer also to water availability but on a finer spatial scale. Additionally, model-based clustering revealed five altitudinal vegetation zones. This study contributes to a better spatial understanding of the biodiversity and spatial arrangement of vegetation belts of the largely unknown but highly unique lomas formations. Furthermore, mapping species richness and plant species' distributions could support a long-needed lomas strategic conservation scheme.

AB Regional vegetation-climate modelling studies have typically focused on boreal or temperate ecosystems in North America and Europe, almost completely overlooking tropical ecosystems. We present the first results of simulated regional vegetation-climate dynamics in Middle America as simulated by the model, LPJ-GUESS. The Kappa statistic indicated poor agreement, with a Kappa value of 0.301. When we modified the Kappa statistic by aggregating cell sizes and using generalized biomes, the Kappa value increased to 0.543, indicating a fair agreement. Total LAI simulated from LPJ-GUESS was strongly correlated to remotely sensed LAI values (r=0.75). Our simulations indicate that fire frequency was overestimated in tropical moist forests and underestimated in savannas. This underestimation of fire resulted in an over-simulation of dry tropical forest at the expense of savanna. We highlight additional reasons for the initially poor representation of vegetation in Middle America, including factors such as non-parameterized plant functional types (desert shrub, cacti, and other succulents), rugged topography, and an insufficient representation of soil.

AB Disturbances play an important role in forest dynamics across the globe. Researchers have mainly focused on the temporal context of disturbances, but have largely ignored the spatial patterns of tree recruitment they create. Geostatistical tools enable the analysis of spatial patterns and variability in tropical forest disturbance histories. Here, we examine the potential of combining dendroecological analysis and spatial statistics to reconstruct the disturbance history of a seasonal dry evergreen tropical forest plot at the Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary (HKK), western Thailand. We used tree-ring-derived age estimates for 70 individuals of the shade-intolerant pioneer species Melia azederach (Meliaceae) and tree locations across a 316-ha study plot to identify the timing and spatial extent of past disturbances. Although the age distribution for Melia suggested that regeneration had been continuous over the past 60yr, spatial analyses (mark correlation function and kriging) demonstrated the presence of three spatially discrete age cohorts. Two of these cohorts suggested a severe disturbance 20yr before present. A third cohort appears to have established 50years ago. Using historical records, we conclude that fire disturbance is the most likely disturbance factor affecting HKK. Nevertheless, we do not rule out other disturbance factors. The combined application of tree-ring analysis and spatial statistics as applied in this study could be readily applied to reconstruct disturbance histories in other tropical regions where tree species with annual growth rings are present.

AB A gap remains in our understanding of how host-specific fungal pathogens impact negative density dependence (NDD). Here, we investigated survival of Cinnamomum subavenium Miq. seedlings, the dominant canopy species in a seasonal tropical evergreen forest, Thailand. It is infected by a host-specific fungus that is easily identifiable in the field. We quantified the effects of conspecific seedling and adult density on fungal infection and seedling survival over a wide range of environmental heterogeneity in elevation, understory vegetation and presence of forest gaps. Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) for seedling survival revealed that fungal infection significantly reduced survival and had the strongest effect on seedling survival as compared with conspecific density and environmental heterogeneity. Adult conspecific density was not, however, significantly correlated with the probability of infection, and conspecific seedling density was positively associated with increased infection only at high elevations. In contrast to infection, we found a significant positive correlation between conspecific seedling density and the probability of seedling survival. Consequently, our results demonstrate that fungal infection can have major impacts on seedling survival, but not in a manner consistent with local NDD effects on seedlings, as assumed in the Janzen-Connell hypothesis. Our study provides an example of how quantifying the interaction between environmental heterogeneity and a host-specific plant-pathogen can yield unexpected insights into the dynamics of seedling populations. The combined effects of host-specific pathogens and environmental heterogeneity on survival of dominant seedling species may ultimately provide a chance for rarer species to recruit.

AB Patches of fire-sensitive vegetation often occur within fire-prone tropical savannas, and are indicative of localized areas where fire regimes are less severe. These may act as important fire refugia for fire-sensitive biota. The fire-sensitive tree Callitris intratropica occurs in small patches throughout the fire-prone northern Australian savannas, and is widely seen as an indicator of low-severity fire regimes and of good ecosystem health. Here, we address the question: to what extent do Callitris patches act as refuges for other fire-sensitive biota, and therefore play a broader conservation role? We contrast floral and faunal species composition between Callitris patches and surrounding eucalypt savanna, using three case studies. In the first case study, a floristic analysis of 47 Callitris patches across Western Australia's Kimberley region showed that woody species in these patches were overwhelmingly widespread, fire-tolerant savanna taxa. No species of special conservation concern occurred disproportionately within Callitris patches. Similarly, there was no concentration of fire-sensitive fauna or flora in five Callitris patches in the East Kimberley. Finally, there was no difference in ant species composition among 12 Callitris patches and surrounding eucalypt savannas in Kakadu National Park, Northern Territory, and there were no fire-sensitive ant species in Callitris patches. Our three case studies from throughout the northwestern Australia provide no evidence that Callitris patches act as important refuges for fire-sensitive flora or fauna within fire-prone eucalypt savannas. This calls into question the notion that Callitris is a strong indicator of general ecosystem health.

AB Human-induced alteration of habitat is a major threat to biodiversity worldwide, especially in areas of high biological diversity and endemism. Polylepis (Rosaceae) forest, a unique forest habitat in the high Andes of South America, presently occurs as small and isolated patches in grassland dominated landscapes. We examine how the avian community is likely influenced by patch characteristics (i.e., area, plant species composition) and connectivity in a landscape composed of patches of Polylepis forest surrounded by paramo grasslands in Cajas National Park in the Andes of southern Ecuador. We used generalized linear mixed models and an information-theoretic approach to identify the most important variables probably influencing birds inhabiting 26 forest patches. Our results indicated that species richness was associated with area of a patch and floristic composition, particularly the presence of Gynoxys (Asteraceae). However, connectivity of patches probably influenced the abundance of forest and generalists species. Elsewhere, it has been proposed that effective management plans for birds using Polylepis should promote the conservation of mature Polylepis patches. Our results not only suggest this but also show that there are additional factors, such as the presence of Gynoxys plants, which will probably play a role in conservation of birds. More generally, these findings show that while easily measured attributes of the patch and landscape may provide some insights into what influences patch use by birds, knowledge of other factors, such as plant species composition, is essential for better understanding the distribution of birds in fragmented landscapes.

AB One of the main natural disturbances that affects the structure of rain forests is treefalls, frequently resulting in gaps. Tree-fall gaps can bring drastic changes in environmental conditions compared with the undisturbed understory. We investigated the effect of tree-fall gaps on fruit-feeding butterfly (Nymphalidae) species assemblages in an undisturbed lowland rain forest in southeastern Peru. We used fruit-baited traps suspended 2m above ground in 15 tree-fall gaps ranging in area from 100 to 1000m(2) and in adjacent undisturbed understory. Our data support the hypothesis that tree-fall gap and understory habitats are utilized by different butterfly species assemblages. There were morphological differences between gap and understory species, where the understory species had a larger wing area to thoracic volume. Vegetation structure and composition were important factors affecting the butterfly assemblages. Most of the butterfly species showed an avoidance of vines and a strong association with the presence of trees and shrubs in gaps. There were also differences among gap assemblages that increased with gap size. Some of the species that were associated with gaps have been considered as canopy species. Other gap species in the present study, however, are known to feed on fruits and/or use host plants mainly, or only, occurring in gaps, implicating that the gap assemblage is a mix of canopy species and those unique to gaps. This indicates that, in an undisturbed Amazon forest, tree-fall gaps may contribute to maintain species diversity by creating a mosaic of specific habitats and resources that favors different butterfly assemblages.

AB Mismatches in nutrient composition (e.g., protein, carbohydrates, lipids, etc.) between consumers and the resources they depend on can have ecological consequences, affecting traits from individual behavior to community structure. In many terrestrial ecosystems, ants depend on plant and insect mutualist partners for carbohydrate-rich rewards that are nutritionally unbalanced (especially in protein) relative to colony needs. Despite imbalances, many carbohydrate-feeding ant mutualists dominate communitiesboth competitively and numericallyraising the question of whether excess carbohydrates fuel' colony acquisition of limiting resources and growth. In a 10-month field study, we manipulated carbohydrate access for the obligate plant-ant Crematogaster nigriceps to test whether carbohydrate availability could be mechanistically linked to ecological dominance via heightened territory defense, increased protein foraging, and colony growth. Supplementation increased aggressive defense of hosts after only twoweeks, but was also strongly linked to variation in rainfall. Contrary to predictions, we did not find that supplemented colonies increased protein foraging. Instead, colonies with reduced carbohydrate access discovered a greater proportion of protein baits, suggesting that carbohydrate deprivation increases foraging intensity. We found no significant effect of carbohydrate manipulation on brood or alate production. These results contrast with findings from several recent short-term and lab-based nutrient supplementation studies and highlight the role of seasonality and biotic context in colony-foraging and reproductive decisions. These factors may be essential to understanding the consequences of carbohydrate access in natural plant-ant systems.

AB Species may circumvent the impacts of climate warming if the habitats they use reduce ambient temperature. In this study, we identified which frog species from a tropical montane rain forest in the Philippines may be vulnerable to climate warming. To do so, we selected five anuran species that utilize four breeding habitats and identified the sensitivity and exposure of tadpoles and direct-developer eggs to heat by measuring their critical thermal maximums (CTmax) and the habitat-specific temperatures they experience. Our study species included two direct-developer frogsone species that lays its eggs on exposed leaves, and another that lays its eggs in fernsand three species that produce aquatic free-swimming tadpolestwo stream breeders, and one phytotelm (tree hole) breeder. We compared thermal tolerances derived from microclimates of breeding habitats with tolerances derived from macroclimate (i.e., non-buffered air temperature taken from the rain forest canopy). We also examined whether differences in CTmax existed across life-history stages (egg, metamorph/young-of-year, and adult) for the two direct-developer frog species. Habitats buffered ambient temperature and expanded thermal tolerances of all frog species. We found that direct-developers, however, are more vulnerable to increased temperatures than aquatic breedersindicated by their high sensitivity to temperature, and exposure to high temperatures. Direct-developer eggs were more sensitive to warming than both metamorph and adult life-history stages. Thermally buffered microhabitats may represent the only protection against current and impending climate warming. Our data highlight the importance of considering sensitivity and exposure in unison when deciphering warming vulnerability of frogs.

AB In Guyana, the range of the brown capuchin, Cebus apella, meets the range of its congener, the wedge-capped capuchin, C. olivaceus, with the two species exhibiting a mutually exclusive patchy distribution. Squirrel monkeys, Saimiri sciureus, and C. apella form ubiquitous interspecific associations, but the reason remains debatable. With a large biogeographic field study, we tested the degree to which the distribution and abundance of Cebus and S. sciureus is determined by habitat type, fruit availability, and geography (i.e., determinants of the fundamental niche) relative to interspecific interactions, such as competition and facilitation (i.e., the realized niche). We used the competition between the two capuchin monkeys as a natural experiment that subjected S. sciureus to C. apella and C. olivaceus treatments'. Using spatial regression models and principal components analysis, we found that S. sciureus was associated with seasonally flooded forests, and was correlated with fruit abundance and diversity (fundamental niche), but was also correlated with C. apella density even when accounting for habitat and fruit availability (realized niche). Saimiri sciureus density was unrelated to C. olivaceus density. Cebus apella was associated with a variety of forest types, but particularly included disturbed and edge habitats such as logged forests, seasonally flooded forests, and upland savanna, in addition to mature forest. Cebus apella was also positively correlated with S. sciureus density and negatively correlated with the density of C. olivaceus. In contrast, C. olivaceus avoided riparian areas and was associated with mixed-height forests on sloped mountainous terrain. In sum, interspecific interactions such as competition between species of Cebus and facilitation between C. apella and S. sciureus were as important as habitat and fruit availability in determining the distribution and abundance of these primates.

AB Although biological conservation has traditionally focused on the protection of pristine areas, it is becoming increasingly evident that efforts should also be made toward the maintenance of biological diversity in human-managed ecosystems. We evaluated the potential role of scattered, remnant trees in enhancing ant diversity in agricultural lands within a biodiversity hotspot, namely the Cerrado savannas of central Brazil. Ant collections were performed in, beneath, and away from the crowns of a native tree species growing in planted pastures, soy fields, and in small (<400ha) savanna reserves. Significantly more ant species were found beneath than 30m away from scattered trees. The magnitude of this effect was similar in soy fields and in pastures at all scales of our analyses, except at the landscape scale where the effect was comparatively greater in soy fields. Most of the species that occurred more frequently beneath than away from trees nest on ground, indicating that the conservation value of scattered trees goes beyond the mere protection of arboreal ant species. Soy plantations presented a particular species-poor ground-dwelling fauna when compared with savannas, whereas differences in the number and composition of arboreal species were less marked. In contrast, the diversity of arboreal- and ground-dwelling ants recorded in and beneath pasture trees was nearly as high as the one found in savannas. It is suggested that pasture trees can have an important value for ant conservation off reserves, particularly in regions where most of the native vegetation has already been cleared.

AB N-2-fixing trees can affect stream water quality. This has been documented in temperate streams, but not in tropical ones, even though N-2-fixing trees are prevalent in the tropics. We investigated the effects of the introduced, invasive tree, Falcataria moluccana (albizia) on water quality of Hawaiian streams. Nutrient concentrations were measured in reaches above and below F.moluccana-dominated riparian zones of four streams over 14mo, and benthic algal nutrient limitation was examined in one stream. NO3-+NO2- concentrations were up to 600 percent higher in reaches below F.moluccana stands than in ones above them. In contrast, dissolved organic nitrogen concentrations were 24 percent lower in most reaches below F.moluccana stands, and NH4+ and particulate nitrogen concentrations were similar above and below the stands. Dissolved organic carbon concentrations were up to 30 percent lower below F.moluccana stands, but particulate carbon concentrations were similar between reaches. Total dissolved phosphorus concentrations were similar above and below F.moluccana stands, whereas H4SiO4 concentrations were higher below the stands. In the stream where benthic chlorophyll a was measured, concentrations were three times higher below the F.moluccana stand than above it. Benthic algae were co-limited by nitrogen and phosphorus above the F.moluccana stand, and limited by phosphorus below it. These results suggest that F.moluccana's presence relieved nitrogen-limitation and caused the benthic algae to become solely phosphorus-limited. Overall, our results demonstrate that F.moluccana can strongly affect the chemistry and primary producers of these tropical streams.

AB Logging in tropical forests may create large canopy openings. These gaps provide suitable conditions for some opportunistic shrubs and herbs to take advantage of the surge in resources and rapidly colonize disturbed sites. This dense plant cover may limit forest regeneration by interfering with tree seedling establishment, growth, and survival by altering the light and nutrients available to seedlings, modifying herbivore behavior, or a number of other factors. In Kibale National Park (Uganda), old logging sites are mainly covered by dense stands of Acanthus pubescens Engl., which appear to inhibit tree regeneration. We wanted to identify the ecological processes underlying this regeneration collapse. To do so, we designed a factorial experiment to evaluate the influences of herbivory and vegetation cover on the growth and survival of tree seedlings. We compared the survival and growth of transplanted tree seedlings in A. pubescens stands and logged forests, in the presence or absence of the understory vegetation layer (logged forest) or vegetation cover (A. pubescens), and with or without herbivory. We found no evidence to support the hypothesis that herbivory is significantly higher under dense A. pubescens cover. Seedling survival was not influenced by the environment. Seedling growth, however, was positively influenced by the removal of A. pubescens, suggesting that changes in resource availability associated with the presence of A. pubescens, may be important for regeneration. Our results suggest that sustained cutting of A. pubescens cover could foster the growth of established seedlings and could lead to tree regeneration and habitat restoration.

AB Sprouting ability is highly variable among different tree species. In many cases, there are trade-offs in carbon allocations between growth and storage in seedlings. However, this trade-off is likely to change with growth stages from seedling to mature plant because carbon investments in reproductive activities and/or risk of disturbance also change by species and growth stage. To examine how sprouting ability and carbohydrate storage change with growth stage, we compared two tropical secondary-forest trees, Macaranga bancana and M. gigantea, which have different ecological traits. Maximum tree size and growth rate are higher in M. gigantea. We monitored sprout growth and stored resources, including total non-structural carbohydrate (TNC) and nitrogen in the root, among different tree sizes for 12 months following stem-cutting treatment. Sprouting ability (total sprout mass) and TNC concentrations were significantly higher in small individuals than in larger specimens in both species. TNC concentration decreased in all size classes after stem cutting. Macaranga bancana had greater sprout survivorship than M. gigantea, which had higher sprouting ability in larger tree-size classes. Thus, sprouting ability likely depends on root TNC concentration and tree-size class in both Macaranga species. Higher TNC concentration and sprout survival rates in M. bancana may be related to greater carbon allocation in survival than in growth. This hypothesis is consistent with the ecological traits of M. bancana, such as its growth rate, which was lower than that of M. gigantea.

AB Decreases in rainfall have been proposed to have a negative impact on tropical rain forests, and West Africa is currently experiencing a decline in rainfall at the multi-decadal scale. Here, we present analyses of a long-term dataset on the plant fruiting status from individuals of 44 species of the tropical rain forest of Tai National Park, Cote d'Ivoire. This study includes records of 1401 individuals collected at monthly intervals for over 12yr, 984 of which survived throughout the entire study period. The aims of this study were to: (1) quantitate inter-annual trends in species and forest scale fruit presence; and (2) test the importance of rainfall in explaining inter-annual fruit presence variability. Long-term upward trends in the expected proportion of individuals with fruits were found for the majority of species, while no significant downward trends were detected, driving a significant upward trend at the community level. Peak production months of the upward trending species were not associated with the dry or wet season. Significant rainfall correlations with the total proportion of individuals showing fruit were generally negative, with only five species showing significant positive correlations. Taken together, these results suggest that the observed inter-annual trends and variability of fruit abundance are currently not associated with rainfall. We discuss several parsimonious and complex alternative explanations.

AB Hurricanes represent the dominant type of disturbance in many tropical coastal forests. Here, we focus on mortality of epiphytic orchids caused by hurricane Ivan in the Guanahacabibes National Park (Cuba) and subsequent population recovery. We analyzed different aspects of hurricane damage on two contrasting epiphytic orchids, Broughtonia cubensis and Dendrophylax lindenii, as observed in three plots of coastal vegetation and in three plots of semi-deciduous forest, respectively. First, we quantified the damage to host trees and orchids and explored if hurricane damage depended on height, size, or identity of the host tree. Second, we used mark connection and mark correlation functions to conduct a detailed analysis of small-scale spatial patterns in hurricane damage for host trees and orchids. Finally, we analyzed the degree of recovery after Ivan during the 6yr following the storm. Damage of B. cubensis host trees was independent of height and size, but Ivan severely affected larger and higher host trees of D. lindenii. Spatial analysis revealed non-random structure in damage that differed between species. Broughtonia cubensis exhibited small-scale spatial correlation in the proportion of damaged orchids, whereas D. lindenii did not. Dendrophylax lindenii showed patchy' damage patterns, correlated with height, but B. cubensis did not. The relative growth rate of B. cubensis for the 5-17mo following Ivan was only moderately reduced and fully recovered in subsequent years, whereas that of D. lindenii was severely reduced the first year and did not fully recover thereafter. We hypothesize that differences in the host, vegetation type, and the traits of the two orchids contribute to the different responses to the hurricane.

AB In spite of their recognized importance as seed dispersers in other parts of the tropics, seed dispersal by fruit bats has received scant research attention in Africa. To evaluate the role of African fruit bats in seed dispersal, we studied fruits and seeds below 480 bat feeding roosts in the East Usambara Mountains of Tanzania. We compared these findings to those reported in other African localities to place our results in a broader context. We found 49 plant species dispersed by bats: 28 species, 18 genera, and one family are novel reports of bat dispersal in Africa. Approximately 20 percent of the submontane tree flora of the East Usambaras is bat-dispersed, including both widespread and endemic trees. African fruit bats are important seed dispersers at our study site because they move seeds of dozens of species tens or hundreds of meters, even seeds that are too large to ingest (greater than 5mm in length). Fruit bats are likely important seed dispersers in other Afrotropical forests, as bats elsewhere in Africa are known to consume 20 genera and 16 species of plants reported here. Insights from studying remains under bat feeding roosts offer a simple method to further document and substantially increase our understanding of the role of African fruit bats in seed dispersal.

AB How strong-beaked frugivores such as parrots affect other frugivores is poorly understood. This study quantitated six indices of habitat quality for the facultatively frugivorous Bananaquit (Coereba flaveola) using two habitat types and three treatments of habitat quality, namely old growth forest versus citrus orchards in Dominica, the latter habitat type with and without parrot frugivory. The study also controlled for elevation, rainfall and citrus fruit maturity. The results indicate that both the quantity of parrot frugivory and fruit maturity at the time of frugivory influenced the habitat quality for Bananaquits. Their abundance was higher, individuals stored more fat, and parasite loads were lower on farms with more parrot frugivory. Fruit quality mediated the influence of the quantity of parrot frugivory insofar as Bananaquit body condition was tightly correlated with the fruit chemistry at the time of frugivory or harvest. This study provides empirical evidence of a commensal association and underscores the important ecological role of Neotropical psittacines as mediators of habitat quality for other animal. The findings further suggest that loss of these apex consumers may have triggered previously unappreciated trophic cascades, particularly in island ecosystems lacking large mammalian canopy frugivores.

AB Mistletoes represent the best example of specialization in seed dispersal, with a reduced assemblage of dispersal agents. Specific dispersal requirements mediated by the specificity of seed deposition site have apparently led to the evolution of such close relationships between mistletoes and certain frugivores. Here, we provide evidences for another case of specialization involving epiphytic cacti in the genus Rhipsalis, and small Neotropical passerines Euphonia spp., which also act as the main seed dispersers of mistletoes in the family Viscaceae. With field observations, literature search, and observations on captive birds, we demonstrated that Rhipsalis have specific establishment requirements, and euphonias are the most effective dispersers of Rhipsalis seeds in both quantitative and qualitative aspects, potentially depositing seeds onto branches of host plants. We interpret the similar dispersal systems of Rhipsalis and Viscaceae mistletoes, which involve the same dispersal agents, similar fruit morphologies, and fruit chemistry as convergent adaptive strategies that enable seeds of both groups to reach adequate microsites for establishment in host branches.

AB Although termites are ecosystem engineers in tropical and sub-tropical environments, the study of termite ecology is often constrained by sampling difficulties and a lack of established sampling protocols, particularly for savannas. The efficiency and relevance of different methods along climatic gradients, even within a single biome, is largely unknown. Here, we compare the relative contribution of two commonly used sampling methods, cellulose baits and active searching transects, in quantifying savanna termite diversity along a rainfall gradient in South Africa; sampling was conducted during the wet season across four markedly different savanna types. We also assessed the usefulness of different forms of baiting techniques. The relative efficiency of sampling method varied with annual rainfall. In arid savannas, baiting was as effective as active searching transects at sampling termite diversity and we recommend the use of baiting rather due to it being less labor intensive. In savannas of moderately low to intermediate rainfall, baiting and transects sampled different termite species and so both are deemed necessary for an accurate assessment of termite diversity. In contrast, in wetter savannas transects gave a better assessment of diversity, with cellulose baits not contributing much to diversity assessment. The efficiency of baiting techniques differed across the rainfall gradient, with baits needing to be left in the field for a longer period in more arid savannas. We conclude that habitat type, even within a single biome, will determine the sampling method or methods necessary to quantify termite diversity accurately.

AB We examined long-term responses of an Amazonian bird assemblage to wildfire disturbance, investigating how understory birds reacted to forest regeneration 1, 3, and 10years after a widespread fire event. The bird community was sampled along the Arapiuns and Maro river catchments in central Brazilian Amazonia. Sampling took place in 1998, 2000, and 2008 using mist-nets in eight plots (four burned, four unburned sites). Species richness did not change significantly in unburned sites. In burned sites, however, we found significantly lower richness in 1998, higher richness in 2000, and similar richness in 2008. Multi-dimensional scaling ordination showed consistent differences in bird communities both within burned sites sampled in different sampling years, and between burned and unburned sites in all years. Of the 30 most abundant species, 12 had not recovered 10years after the fires, including habitat specialists such as mixed flocks specialists and ant-followers. Fire-disturbance favored three species (two hummingbirds and a manakin) in the short term only. All other species were either favored throughout the study (seven species of omnivores and small insectivores) or did not show a clear response (eight species). In burned sites, we also found significantly lower abundance of species sensitive to disturbances and habitat specialists over the entire study period. Although the bird community seems to be recovering in terms of richness, the overall community composition and abundance of some species in post-burned and unburned sites remain very different, and have not recovered after 10years of forest regeneration.

AB Habitat heterogeneity may affect the structure of animal assemblages even within apparently homogenous landscapes. Gallery forests of the Amazonia-Cerrado ecotone have a small-scale patchiness that is induced by river system dynamics. Gallery forests that never flood are located in upper areas of watercourse margins, whereas seasonally flooded gallery forests are located at lower ground along those margins. We tested the prediction that the assemblage structure of small non-volant mammals of these two types of forests is distinct and arises from the ecological heterogeneity induced by seasonal floods. We found that species composition differed between forest types, with arboreal species dominating in the seasonally flooded forests and a more balanced distribution of arboreal and terrestrial species in unflooded forests. We found no differences in species abundance between habitats, but species richness was higher in unflooded forests. We hypothesize that this difference is due to decreased resource availability for strictly terrestrial species in seasonally flooded forests. Relative biomass of seasonally flooded forests was more than twice that of unflooded forests due to the dominance of large-bodied didelphid species in that assemblage. Our results suggest that the ecological heterogeneity created by seasonal floods is central to maintaining diverse assemblages in this region. The preservation of both unflooded and flooded gallery forests, which are under high human pressure from deforestation, agricultural conversion, and implementation of dams, may be crucial to preserving small mammal diversity at the landscape scale.

AB Animals modify their foraging strategies in response to environmental changes that affect foraging performance. In some species, cleptobiosis represents an alternative strategy for resource access. The environmental factors that favor the incidence or prevalence of cleptobiosis, however, are poorly described. The cleptobiotic Neotropical ant Ectatomma ruidum is characterized by a high frequency of thievery behavior, a specific type of intraspecific cleptobiosis, in which specialized thief workers insinuate themselves into nests of neighboring colonies and intercept food items brought into these nests. Here, we evaluate how colonies adjust thievery behavior in response to food availability. We supplemented food availability and measured how the incidence and intensity of thievery responded to resource availability. We found that the incidence and intensity of thievery decline in response to supplemental food, suggesting that thievery behavior is a response to resource limitation at the population scale. This finding indicates that the phenomenon of intraspecific thievery, although a rare strategy in among colonies of social animals, is a viable alternative foraging tactic in the context of competition and food limitation.

AB Herbivores can both consume and facilitate primary producers with important consequences for community structure. How differences in herbivore foraging ecology alter the relative importance of such effects is not well understood, especially in tropical lentic systems. To address this issue, we manipulated the density of two herbivores with different foraging strategies to evaluate their effects on primary producers and other consumers. Specifically, we examined the effects of the tadpoles of two common Neotropical hylid frogs at two densities on conspecific growth, periphyton and phytoplankton, and zooplankton. We found that the tadpoles of the pantless treefrog, Dendropsophus ebraccatus, reduced periphyton and increased phytoplankton abundances, whereas they had no affect on zooplankton. The red-eyed treefrog, Agalychnis callidryas, also reduced periphyton and increased phytoplankton, but to a greater extent, and they also had strong impacts on zooplankton by altering the composition, size structure, and total abundances of the zooplankton community. Differences between both species' impacts on these food webs were independent of tadpole biomass, as size-selective filter feeding and nutrient cycling seems to drive the impacts of A. callidryas on phytoplankton and zooplankton, while the role of D. ebraccatus is more limited. Species level differences in the strength and direction of top-down and bottom-up effects on food webs suggest that the ecological roles of tadpoles may be diverse and important to aquatic communities.

AB Understanding species-specific habitat selection is essential to identify how natural systems are assembled and maintained, and how emerging natural and anthropogenic disturbances will affect ecosystem function. In the Neotropics, Peter's tent-roosting bat (Uroderma bilobatum), known to roost in forests, has become abundant in human-modified areas. To understand how habitat characteristics in both intact forest and human-modified areas influence the presence and density of U. bilobatum, we characterized habitat use at two scales (macrohabitat and microhabitat) and used logistic and poisson regressions to determine which habitat characteristics best predicted the presence and density of U. bilobatum within each scale. Moreover, we performed a redundancy analysis to determine which habitat scale explained more variation. As these bats are obligate tent roosters, we used tent as a surrogate for bat presence and density. We found that both macrohabitat and microhabitat scales explained variation in presence and density. Characteristics of the microhabitat scale, however, had higher predictive power, revealing that U. bilobatum preferentially inhabits areas with high density of coconut palms. Coconut palms were introduced recently in the Neotropics and are found only in human-modified areas. Therefore, we hypothesize that U. bilobatum is expanding its range into these areas following the expanded distribution of this exotic plant species.

AB The Brazilian Atlantic Forest has been replaced by homogeneous tree monocultures with potentially drastic effect on ecological interactions. We expect that ecologically-managed tree monocultures, however, can help to mitigate this impact. Here, we carried out an experiment with Inga vera (Fabaceae), an extrafloral nectary bearing plant, to test if the efficiency of ants as anti-herbivory defense is affected by the replacement of its natural habitat (Araucaria Forest) by ecologically-managed tree monocultures (plantations of Araucaria, Pinus, and Eucalyptus). Seedlings of Inga vera were transplanted to three patches of each habitat and ants were excluded from half of the plants. The abundance of ants and herbivores was low, similar among habitats, and exhibited temporal asynchrony. Number of herbivores and accumulated herbivory levels were lower in plant with ants. Rates of herbivory were extremely low and lower for young leaves than for mature leaves. The presence of ants did not affect plant performance traits measured by their growth in height, and their final numbers of leaves and leaflets. Contrary to what might be expected, ant-protected plants produced fewer leaves and leaflets than unprotected ones. In conclusion, Inga vera-ant interaction was similar between its natural habitat and the tree monocultures, indicating that potentially both species diversity and ecological processes can be conserved in ecologically-managed tree monocultures.

AB Golden-headed lion tamarins (GHLTs; Leontopithecus chrysomelas) are endangered primates endemic to the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, where loss of forest and its connectivity threaten species survival. Understanding the role of habitat availability and configuration on population declines is critical for guiding proactive conservation for this, and other, endangered species. We conducted population viability analysis to assess vulnerability of ten GHLT metapopulations to habitat loss and small population size. Seven metapopulations had a low risk of extirpation (or local extinction) over the next 100 years assuming no further forest loss, and even small populations could persist with immediate protection. Three metapopulations had a moderate/high risk of extirpation, suggesting extinction debt may be evident in parts of the species' range. When deforestation was assumed to continue at current rates, extirpation risk significantly increased while abundance and genetic diversity decreased for all metapopulations. Extirpation risk was significantly negatively correlated with the size of the largest patch available to metapopulations, underscoring the importance of large habitat patches for species persistence. Finally, we conducted sensitivity analysis using logistic regression, and our results showed that local extinction risk was sensitive to percentage of females breeding, adult female mortality, and dispersal rate and survival; conservation or research programs that target these aspects of the species' biology/ecology could have a disproportionately important impact on species survival. We stress that efforts to protect populations and tracts of habitat of sufficient size throughout the species' distribution will be important in the near-term to protect the species from continuing decline and extinction.

AB In East Africa, up to four symbiotic ant species associate with the obligate myrmecophyte Acacia drepanolobium. These ant species differ in the extent to which they defend their host trees from both vertebrate and invertebrate herbivores, but other potential roles of ants in tree defense have not been studied. We investigate the distribution of a new species of parasitic midge targeting A. drepanolobium in a region where A. drepanolobium is inhabited almost exclusively by two ant speciesCrematogaster nigriceps and C. mimosae. We find that the frequency of infestation correlates strongly with the identity of the ant occupant: trees inhabited by C. nigriceps are significantly less likely to be infested with parasitic midges. Although the two ant species responded similarly to simulated large herbivore disturbances, trees inhabited by C. nigriceps also had a lower invertebrate load than trees inhabited by C. mimosae. We suggest that differences in defensive behavior towards invertebrates could be one explanation of the observed differences in infestation of A. drepanolobium by parasitic midges.

AB Cell walls, water, and gas that have mechanical and physiological functions in wood, and wood specific gravity (WSG) is related to demographic traits. To understand variation in wood structure and function, we analyzed radial changes in WSG, in the gas and the water fractions from trees growing in four different habitats in a southern Mexican rain forest. Mean WSG was 0.55 +/- 0.16, slightly lower than reported for other tropical forests. In 27 species, WSG decreased and in two species, it increased from pith to bark with a strong (r2=0.65) negative correlation between WSG in the center of the tree and the radial WSG gradient. Habitat had some effect on mean WSG and trees growing on karst had significantly higher WSG than the same species growing on alluvial soil. The cell wall, water, and gas fractions accounted for 35 percent (range: 1650), 42 percent (2865), and 23 percent (256), respectively, of wood volume, with a negative correlation between the gas and the cell wall and between the gas and the water fractions, but not between the cell wall and water fractions. Radially increasing WSG is advantageous for pioneer trees with fast initial growth. We found that the water displacement method may result in biased WSG estimates. To increase the accuracy of WSG data, we suggest to measure sample volume geometrically using a constant diameter (that of the borer tip), to include radial variation in WSG, and to consider for possible site effects on species-specific WSG.

AB A standardized rapid inventory method providing information on both tree species diversity and aboveground carbon stocks in tropical forests will be an important tool for evaluating efforts to conserve biodiversity and to estimate the carbon emissions that result from deforestation and degradation (REDD). Herein, we contrast five common plot methods differing in shape, size, and effort requirements to estimate tree diversity and aboveground tree biomass (AGB). We simulated the methods across six Neotropical forest sites that represent a broad gradient in forest structure, tree species richness, and floristic composition, and we assessed the relative performance of methods by evaluating the bias and precision of their estimates of AGB and tree diversity. For a given sample of forest area, a several small' (<1ha) sampling strategy led to a smaller coefficient of variation (CV) in the estimate of AGB than a few large' one. The effort (person-days) required to achieve an accurate AGB estimate (<10% CV), however, was greater for the smallest plots (0.1ha) than for a compromise approach using 0.5ha modified Gentry plots, which proved to be the most efficient method to estimate AGB across all forest types. Gentry plots were also the most efficient at providing accurate estimates of tree diversity (<10% CV of Hill number). We recommend the use of the 0.5ha modified Gentry plot method in future rapid inventories, and we discuss a set of criteria that should inform any choice of inventory method.

AB The literature on tropical rain forest plant-community relationships with environmental factors usually does not recognize that the relative importance of environmental factors recorded in each study might be due to their amplitude of variation within sites. Geographic scale, however, is recognized as an important modulator of this relative importance. To disentangle the effects of scale and environmental amplitude, ferns and trees in two landscapes of the same size (each 25km2) with different soil-fertility amplitudes but similar soil-texture range were sampled in central Amazonia. We found that major determinants of community structure were the same for ferns and trees. Texture was the main predictor of community structure in the site with homogeneous soil fertility, while availability of exchangeable cations was the main predictor in the site with a wider fertility range. When both sites were analyzed together, soil fertility was the main predictor of community structure and soil texture segregated floristic subgroups within certain ranges of the soil-fertility gradient. We conclude that: (1) floristic patterns for trees and ferns are congruent; (2) floristic variation depends on the amplitude of the studied gradients, more than on geographical scale; (3) limiting factors are not necessarily the most important predictors of compositional patterns; and (4) communities are structured hierarchically. Therefore, landscape structure (meaning which combinations of environmental factors, their amplitude of variation and which part of the gradient is found within the landscape) affect our perception of the relative importance that environmental factors will have as predictors of species composition.

AB The spatial arrangement of tree species is a key aspect of community ecology. Because tree species in tropical forests occur at low densities, it is logistically challenging to measure distributions across large areas. In this study, we evaluated the potential use of canopy tree crown maps, derived from high-resolution aerial digital photographs, as a relatively simple method for measuring large-scale tree distributions. At Barro Colorado Island, Panama, we used high-resolution aerial digital photographs (similar to 0.129m/pixel) to identify tree species and map crown distributions of four target tree species. We determined crown mapping accuracy by comparing aerial and ground-mapped distributions and tested whether the spatial characteristics of the crown maps reflect those of the ground-mapped trees. Nearly a quarter (22%) of the common canopy species had sufficiently distinctive crowns to be good candidates for reliable mapping. The errors of commission (crowns misidentified as a target species) were relatively low, but the errors of omission (missed canopy trees of the target species) were high. Only 40 percent of canopy individuals were mapped on the air photographs. Despite failing to accurately predict exact abundances of canopy trees, crown distributions accurately reproduced the clumping patterns and spatial autocorrelation features of three of four tree species and predicted areas of high and low abundance. We discuss a range of ecological and forest management applications for which this method can be useful.

AB Recent evidence suggests that liana abundance and biomass are increasing in Neotropical forests, representing a major structural change to tropical ecosystems. Explanations for these increases, however, remain largely untested. Over an 8-yr period (19992007), we censused lianas in nine, 24x36m permanent plots in old-growth and selectively logged forest at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica to test whether: (1) liana abundance and basal area are increasing in this forest; (2) the increase is being driven by increased recruitment, decreased mortality, or both; and (3) long-distance clonal colonization explains the increase in liana abundance and basal area. We defined long-distance clonal colonization as lianas that entered and rooted in the plots as vegetative propagules of stems that originated from outside or above the plot, and were present in 2007, but not in 1999 or 2002. Our hypotheses were supported in the old-growth forest: mean liana abundance and BA (1cm diameter) increased 15 and 20 percent, respectively, and clonal colonization from outside of the plots contributed 19 and 60 percent (respectively) to these increases. Lianas colonized clonally by falling vertically from the forest canopy above or growing horizontally along the forest floor and re-rootingcommon forms of colonization for many liana species. In the selectively logged forest, liana abundance and BA did not change, and thus the pattern of increasing lianas may be restricted to old-growth forests. In summary, our data support the hypothesis that lianas are increasing in old-growth forests, and that long-distance clonal colonization is a major contributor.

AB In Neotropical forests, mammals act as seed dispersers and predators. To prevent seed predation and promote dispersal, seeds exhibit physical or chemical defenses. Collared peccaries (Pecari tajacu) cannot eat some hard seeds, but can digest chemically defended seeds. Central American agoutis (Dasyprocta punctata) gnaw through hard-walled seeds, but cannot consume chemically defended seeds. The objectives of this study were to determine relative peccary and agouti abundances within a lowland forest in Costa Rica and to assess how these two mammals affect the survival of large seeds that have no defenses (Iriartea deltoidea, Socratea exorrhiza), physical defenses (Astrocaryum alatum, Dipteryx panamensis), or chemical defenses (Mucuna holtonii) against seed predators. Mammal abundances were determined over 3yrs from open-access motion-detecting camera trap photos. Using semi-permeable mammal exclosures and thread-marked seeds, predation and dispersal by mammals for each seed species were quantified. Abundances of peccaries were up to six times higher than those of agoutis over 3yrs, but neither peccary nor agouti abundances differed across years. Seeds of A.alatum were predominantly dispersed by peccaries, which did not eat A.alatum seeds, whereas non-defended and chemically defended seeds suffered high levels of predation, mostly by peccaries. Agoutis did not eat M.holtonii seeds. Peccaries and agoutis did not differ in the distances they dispersed seeds. This study shows that seed fates are contingent upon many factors such as seed defenses, frugivoregranivore abundances, and seed-handling capabilities. Mammalseed interactions are complex; the outcomes of these interactions depend on the inherent characteristics of seeds and their potential dispersers.

AB The Atlantic Forest domain, one of the 25 world's hotspots for biodiversity, has experienced dramatic changes in its landscape. While the loss of species diversity is well documented, functional diversity has not received the same amount of attention. In this study, we evaluated functional diversity of insects in streams utilizing three indices: functional diversity (FD), functional dispersion (FDis), and functional divergence (FDiv), seeking to understand the roles of three predictor sets in explaining functional patterns: (1) bioclimatic and landscape variables; (2) spatial variables; and (3) local environmental variables. We determined the amount of variation in different measures of functional diversity that was explained by each predictor set and their interplays using variation partitioning. Our study showed that variation in functional diversity is better explained by a set of variables linked to different scales dependent on spatial structures, indicating the importance of landscape and mainly environmental variables in the functional organization of aquatic insect communities, and that the relative importance of predictor sets depends on the indices considered. Variation in FD was better explained by the interplay among the three predictor sets and by local environmental variables, whereas variation in FDis was better explained by spatial variables and by the interplay between environmental and spatial variables. Variation in FDiv was not significantly explained by any predictors. Our study adds more evidence on the harmful effects caused by landscape changes on biodiversity in the Atlantic Forest, suggesting that these effects also influence the functional organization of stream insect communities.

AB Studies comparing the abundance of frugivorous bats in shade-coffee plantations and forest fragments report contradictory results, and have not taken into account the landscape context in which coffee plantations are immersed. Variables of population composition such as abundance, sex proportion, and reproductive condition, together with biological tags (i.e., bat fly prevalence), can provide information about spatiotemporal dynamics of habitats used by bats. In the central part of Veracruz, Mexico, we compared population variables and ectoparasite prevalence of the highland yellow-shouldered bat (Sturnira ludovici) in two landscapes, one dominated by shade-coffee plantations and another by forest fragments. Comparing these attributes between these two landscapes will increase our knowledge about the role of this agro-ecosystem in the conservation of this species, which is an important seed disperser of cloud forest vegetation. Total abundance and proportion of females was greater in forest fragments than in coffee plantations, whereas the percentage of reproductive females and bat fly prevalence was similar between landscapes. Our results show that landscapes with forest fragments harbor the greatest abundance of S. ludovici, but shade-coffee plantations also are utilized by S. ludovici and likely adjacent forest remnants provide enough food resources for this species and other frugivores. Moreover, this study provides more evidence documenting the importance of preserving the last cloud forest fragments in the central region of Veracruz, Mexico, and suggests that using shade-coffee plantations to connect forest fragments may be an effective way of maintaining populations of S. ludovici and likely other volant frugivores.

AB Habitat heterogeneity is a primary ecological factor that is particularly pronounced in arid ecosystems. The Tehuacan valley is a subtropical semi-arid ecosystem in which several species of columnar cacti and agave (i.e., CAM plants) constitute the dominant elements accompanied by patches of trees and shrubs (i.e., C3 plants). Vegetation in Tehuacan is isotopically heterogenous because CAM plants have less depleted 13C values than C3 plants. Fruits and flowers of cactus and agaves offer abundant food to vertebrates, but their leaves might be less attractive to insects than the leaves of C3 plants. Therefore, we use carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analysis to test the hypothesis that C3 and CAM food would contribute asymmetrically to different guilds of birds and bats. We predict that granivorous and frugivorous birds and nectarivorous and frugivorous bats will consume a CAM diet, whereas insectivorous birds and bats will consume a C3 diet. Due to omnivory of bird and bat consumers, we predict that the importance of CAM food will decrease as the trophic level of the animal increases. Our results showed that CAM food predominated in plant-eating birds and in some flower-visiting bats, whereas C3 food predominated in insect-eating bats and birds and frugivorous bats. Habitat heterogeneity in Tehuacan is important for conservation due to the asymmetric role of CAM and C3 food in the nutrition of different feeding guilds of vertebrates. Our study provides basic information to evaluate the potential impact of habitat loss on functional groups of consumers in a semi-arid ecosystem.

AB In the Peruvian Amazon, white-sand forests are patchily distributed and restricted to a few localities in the North. Although recent studies have documented patterns of habitat specialization by plants in these unique forests, very few studies of the fauna of these habitats have been conducted. The species composition of the avifauna of the white-sand forests at six localities in the region was sampled by conducting transects and point counts. Surrounding habitats were also sampled to compare avifaunal communities and to determine the degree of restriction of bird species to white-sand habitats. Non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis showed that bird communities of white-sand forests were more similar to each other than they were to terra firme or flooded forest communities. Sites on either side of the Amazon-Maranon barrier were the most similar within habitat type consistent with the hypothesis that these rivers represent a major biogeographic barrier. Twenty-six species, belonging to 13 families, were to some degree specialized to white-sand forests. This is the first comprehensive ornithological assessment carried out on these habitats in Peru. The high degree of habitat specialization found in these 26 bird species highlights the need for conservation and management measures that will protect white-sand forests.

AB Jaguars (Panthera onca) and pumas (Puma concolor) coexist throughout the Neotropics. Using camera trapping in four Brazilian biomes, we compare the daily activity patterns of the jaguar and puma, and their relationships with their main prey species. We used a kernel density method to quantify daily activity patterns and to investigate overlap between these predators and their main prey. Both cats showed intensive nocturnal and crepuscular activity (0.69 and 0.14 kernel density, respectively, for jaguars; 0.68 and 0.19 kernel density, respectively, for pumas). Only in the Pantanal did we observe a pattern of concentrated diurnal activity for both species. We found little temporal segregation between jaguars and pumas, as they showed similar activity patterns with high coefficients of overlapping (average 1=0.86; SE=0.15). We also observed a significant overlap between the activity patterns of the predators and their main prey species, suggesting that both predators adjust their activity to reduce their foraging energy expenditure. Our findings suggest that temporal partitioning is probably not a generalized mechanism of coexistence between jaguars and pumas; instead, the partitioning of habitat/space use and food resources may play a larger role in mediating top predator coexistence. Knowledge about these behavior aspects is crucial to elucidating the factors that enable coexistence of jaguars and pumas. Furthermore, an understanding of their respective activity periods is relevant to management and associated research efforts.

AB Resource availability can influence animal movement causing changes in home-range size and arrangement between seasons. We investigated the influence of acuri palm (Attalea phalerata) on the occupancy of agouti Dasyprocta azare during both the dry and rainy seasons, as well as the abandonment probabilities in the transition between seasons in the Brazilian Pantanal. The agoutis occupied a high proportion of the forested areas in the rainy season (0.83), but the occupancy decreased in the dry season (0.39). In the rainy season, occupancy by agoutis was not correlated with acuri palm availability, while in the dry season, it was positively correlated with the palm's availability. The acuri palm availability also drove the agoutis' probability of site abandonment from the rainy to the dry season, with higher abandonment probability in sites with low acuri palm availability. These findings show that this large-seeded palm can be an important resource for the agoutis' populations during the fruit-scarcity period. The acuri palm seeds may be particularly important for agoutis using fragmented forests, given that the large-seeded palms are able to persist even in small fragments, which is untrue for other important resource.

AB Whether aging forest fragments are able to recover original assemblages or progressively move toward impoverished successional stages remains as an open question. This study tested the hypothesis that seedling assemblages in forest fragments differ from those across mature forest stands and examined to what extent the uncovered patterns supported the notion that edge-affected habitats tend to support impoverished tree assemblages dominated by pioneer species. We contrasted a series of small forest remnants (391ha) to old-growth stands located in the largest (ca 3500ha) and best preserved forest remnant in northeastern Brazil and found that tree seedling assemblages inhabiting forest fragments exhibited reduced species richness (up to 50%) at different spatial scales in comparison to seedling assemblages in mature forest and adult assemblages in both fragments and mature forest stands. Moreover, ordination analyses clearly segregated fragment seedling assemblages in taxonomic/functional terms and segregation correlated to the richness of pioneer species. Seedlings of pioneer species and those bearing medium-sized seeds (0.61.5cm) increased in fragments, whereas large-seeded species (1.53.0cm) were reduced by more than a half. Such a multiple-scale replacement of the old-growth flora by pioneers was also confirmed by an indicator species analysis and the resulting pioneer indicator species. Our results suggest that small forest fragments support impoverished and distorted seedling assemblages. This floristic/functional drift implies that forest remnants or edge-affected habitats tend to be dominated by a small set of pioneer tree species rather than supporting a substantial portion of the old-growth flora as do mature forest stands.

AB Tropical dry forests are the most threatened forest type in the world yet a paucity of research about them stymies development of appropriate conservation actions. The ParanA River Basin has the most significant dry forest formations in the Cerrado biome of central Brazil and is threatened by intense land conversion to pastures and agriculture. We examined changes in ParanA River Basin deforestation rates and fragmentation across three time intervals that covered 31yr using Landsat imagery. Our results indicated a 66.3 percent decrease in forest extent between 1977 and 2008, with an annual rate of forest cover change of 3.5 percent. Landscape metrics further indicated severe forest loss and fragmentation, resulting in an increase in the number of fragments and reduction in patch sizes. Forest fragments in flatlands have virtually disappeared and the only significant forest remnants are mostly found over limestone outcrops in the eastern part of the basin. If current patterns persist, we project that these forests will likely disappear within 25yr. These patterns may be reversed with creation of protected areas and involvement of local people to preserve small fragments that can be managed for restoration.

AB Accelerated human development in coastal areas is causing declines in coral reefs worldwide, but the mechanisms by which development leads to reef degradation are often difficult to identify. Here, we use Akaike information criterion model averaging in combination with path analysis to test for the direct and indirect effects of potential environmental stressors on two coral diseases on the west coast of Hawai'i. We quantified human-altered land cover and human population density at two spatial scales: inland area of 1-km radius and watershed. We then tested for the effects of these land cover variables, as well as seawater chlorophyll concentrations, depth, host coral cover, and proximity to surface water discharge on the density of growth anomalies (GA) and prevalence of trematodiasis (TRE) affecting Porites lobata, the locally dominant reef-building coral species. Our analyses showed that human-altered land cover measured at 1-km scale was a strong indirect predictor of GA. Specifically, we found that human interference adjacent to the coast predicted higher chlorophyll concentrations, which in turn predicted higher GA density. We also found that chlorophyll and depth were strong negative predictors of TRE, and host coral cover a positive predictor. Our results indicated that GA are likely regulated by indirect land-based anthropogenic impacts, whereas TRE is mostly affected by host density-dependent forces. Path analysis can serve as a useful tool to rapidly identify the scale and indirect effects of anthropogenic stressors related to coral diseases, allowing for accurate conservation planning in the face of limited resources for tropical conservation.

AB Improved technologies are needed to advance our knowledge of the biophysical and human factors influencing tropical dry forests, one of the world's most threatened ecosystems. We evaluated the use of light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data to address two major needs in remote sensing of tropical dry forests, i.e., classification of forest types and delineation of forest successional status. We evaluated LiDAR-derived measures of three-dimensional canopy structure and subcanopy topography using classification-tree techniques to separate different dry forest types and successional stages in the Guanica Biosphere Reserve in Puerto Rico. We compared the LiDAR-based results with classifications made from commonly used remote sensing data, including Landsat satellite imagery and radar-based topographic data. The accuracy of the LiDAR-based forest type classification (including native- and exotic-dominated forest classes) was substantially higher than those from previously available data (kappa=0.90 and 0.63, respectively). The best result was obtained when combining LiDAR-derived metrics of canopy structure and topography, and adding Landsat spectral data did not improve the classification. For the second objective, we observed that LiDAR-derived variables of vegetation structure were better predictors of forest successional status (i.e., mid-secondary, late-secondary, and primary forests) than was spectral information from Landsat. Importantly, the key LiDAR predictors identified within each classification-tree model agreed with previous ecological knowledge of these forests. Our study highlights the value of LiDAR remote sensing for assessing tropical dry forests, reinforcing the potential for this novel technology to advance research and management of tropical forests in general. Resumo Nuevas tecnologias son necesarias para avanzar en el conocimiento de los factores biofisicos y humanos que afectan a los bosques tropicales secos, uno de los ecosistemas mas amenazados del mundo. En este estudio evaluamos el uso de la tecnologia LiDAR (light detection and ranging) para cubrir dos limitaciones importantes en la teledeteccion de los bosques tropicales secos, incluidas la clasificacion de los tipos de bosques y la delimitacion de estados sucesionales. Especificamente, evaluamos el potencial de las variables tridimensionales de la estructural del bosque y la topografia derivados de LiDAR, mediante tecnicas de arboles de clasificacion, para separar distintos tipos de bosques y estados sucesionales en la Reserva de Biosfera de Guanica, en Puerto Rico. Comparamos los resultados obtenidos de LiDAR con aquellos derivados de fuentes de datos de sensores remotos comunmente utilizados, como las imagenes Landsat y datos topograficos de radar. La precision de la clasificacion de los tipos de bosques obtenida con LiDAR (incluida la presencia de clases dominadas por especies nativas asi como exoticas) fue sustancialmente superior a aquella obtenida con datos de los otros sensores (kappa=0.90 y 0.63 respectivamente). El mejor resultado se obtuvo al combinar variables estructurales del dosel y topografia, todas ellas de LiDAR. La incorporacion de informacion espectral de las imagenes Landsat no mejoro la clasificacion. Como parte del segundo objetivo, encontramos que las variables estructurales de vegetacion de LiDAR lograron separar los estados sucesionales (bosques secundario tardio, medio, y bosque primario), en una forma superior a los datos espectrales de Landsat.
   Importante, las variables de LiDAR identificadas mediante los modelos de clasificacion como las mas importantes en nuestro estudio, concordaron con aquellas esperadas en base al conocimiento ecologico previo de estos bosques. Nuestro trabajo muestra el valor de la tecnologia LiDAR para el estudio de los bosques tropicales secos, y resalta el potencial de esta tecnologia para avanzar en el manejo y la investigacion de los bosques tropicales en general.

AB Tropical storms can shape the structure and productivity of mangrove forests. In this study, we compared current litterfall with historical tropical storm disturbance in the karstic Yucatan Peninsula (YP). We also explored the relationship between litterfall and the fresh/seawater mixture of floodwater. Our hypotheses were that litterfall peaks at moderate perturbations and in sites where seawater dominates the floodwater mixture, and thus, where soil total phosphorus (TP) is relatively high. Litterfall was sampled for 2yr, from eight mangrove forests around the YP. At each site, forest structure, interstitial salinity, TP, nitrogen, carbon, pH, and bulk density were measured. Our results show that mangrove forest from northeast YP are historically impacted by stronger and more frequent tropical storms compared with those in northwest and southeast YP, where tropical storm intensity is moderate and mild, respectively. Litterfall was higher in northwest YP (3g/m2d) compared with northeast and southeast (2g/m2d), mimicking a subsidy-stress gradient where highest productivity is reached at moderate perturbations. Neither salinity nor forest structure alone satisfactorily explained litterfall variability. Soil TP followed a similar geographical pattern as the disturbance gradient: highest concentrations in the northwest YP (0.05%) and lowest in the northeast and southeast (0.03%). Thus, it is likely that TP, and not tropical storm disturbance, is the main driver of litterfall in mangrove forests of the YP. Alterations in TP availability (e.g., sea level rise and aquifer contamination) have the potential to modify mangrove productivity in the region. Resumen Las tormentas tropicales afectan la estructura y productividad de los bosques de manglar. En este estudio, se comparo la produccion de hojarasca con la perturbacion historica de tormentas tropicales en la Peninsula de Yucatan (PY). Tambien se investigo la relacion entre la produccion de hojarasca y la mezcla de agua fresca/marina que inunda a los bosques. Las hipotesis fueron que la produccion de hojarasca es mayor en bosques sujetos a perturbaciones moderadas y en bosques inundados por agua predominantemente marina, y por tanto, donde el fosforo total (FT) es relativamente alto. Se recolecto hojarasca durante dos anos en ocho bosques de manglar. En cada bosque se midio la estructura, salinidad intersticial, FT, nitrogeno, carbono, pH, y densidad del suelo. Los resultados muestran que los bosques de manglar del noreste de la PY son afectados con mayor frecuencia e intensidad por tormentas tropicales en comparacion con los bosques del noroeste y sureste, donde el impacto es moderado y bajo, respectivamente. La produccion de hojarasca fue mayor en el noroeste (3g/m2d) comparada con el noreste y sureste (2g/m2d), semejando un gradiente estres-subsidio donde la mayor produccion se encuentra a perturbaciones moderadas. La estructura del bosque y salinidad no explicaron la variabilidad de la produccion de hojarasca. La concentracion de FT en el suelo vario de la misma forma que el gradiente de perturbacion: mayores concentraciones en el noroeste (0.05%) comparadas con el noreste y sureste de la PY (0.03%). Es probable que la variabilidad de la produccion de hojarasca de la PY sea causada mas que por la intensidad de las tormentas tropicales, por variaciones en el FT. Modificaciones en la disponibilidad de FT (e.g., aumento en el nivel del mar, contaminacion del acuifero) podrian alterar la produccion de los manglares de esta region.

AB Seasonal variations in environmental conditions influence the functioning of the whole ecosystem of tropical rain forests, but as yet little is known about how such variations directly influence the leaf gas exchange and transpiration of individual canopy tree species. We examined the influence of seasonal variations in relative extractable water in the upper soil layers on predawn leaf water potential, saturated net photosynthesis, leaf dark respiration, stomatal conductance, and tree transpiration of 13 tropical rain forest canopy trees (eight species) over 2yr in French Guiana. The canopies were accessed by climbing ropes attached to the trees and to a tower. Our results indicate that a small proportion of the studied trees were unaffected by soil water depletion during seasonal dry periods, probably thanks to efficient deep root systems. The trees showing decreased tree water status (i.e., predawn leaf water potential) displayed a wide range of leaf gas exchange responses. Some trees strongly regulated photosynthesis and transpiration when relative extractable water decreased drastically. In contrast, other trees showed little variation, thus indicating good adaptation to soil drought conditions. These results have important applications to modeling approaches: indeed, precise evaluation and grouping of these response patterns are required before any tree-based functional models can efficiently describe the response of tropical rain forest ecosystems to future changes in environmental conditions.

AB Plant fitness is affected by herbivory, and in moist tropical forests, 70 percent of herbivore damage occurs on young leaves. Thus, to understand the effects of herbivory on tropical plant fitness, it is necessary to understand how tropical young leaves survive the brief, but critical, period of susceptibility. In this study, we surveyed three species of Inga during young leaf expansion. Three classes of toxic secondary metabolites (phenolics, saponins, and tyrosine), extrafloral nectar production, leaf area, and extrafloral nectary area were measured at randomly assigned young leaf sizes. In addition, all defenses were compared for potential trade-offs during leaf expansion. No trade-offs among defenses were found, and the concentration of all defenses, except tyrosine, decreased during leaf expansion. We suggest that plants continued to increase phenolic and saponin content, but at a rate that resulted in decreasing concentrations. In contrast, tyrosine content per leaf steadily increased such that a constant concentration was maintained regardless of young leaf size. Nectar production remained constant during leaf expansion, but, because young leaf area increased by tenfold, the investment in extrafloral nectar per leaf area significantly decreased. In addition, nectary area did not change during leaf expansion and therefore the relative size of the nectary significantly decreased during young leaf expansion. These results support the predictions of the optimal defense hypothesis and demonstrate that the youngest leaves have the highest investment in multiple defenses, most likely because they have the highest nitrogen content and are most susceptible to a diversity of herbivores. Resumen El fitness de las plantas se ve afectado por los herbivoros, y en los bosques tropicales humedos, el 70 por ciento del dano por herbivoros se produce en las hojas jovenes. Por lo tanto, con el fin de comprender los efectos de la herbivoria sobre el fintess de las plantas tropicales, es necesario entender como sobreviven las hojas jovenes al breve, pero critico, periodo de susceptibilidad. Se estudiaron tres especies de Inga durante la expansion de las hojas jovenes. Como medida de las defensas, se midieron tres clases de metabolitos secundarios toxicos (fenoles, saponinas y tirosina), la produccion de nectar extraflorales, area foliar y el area de nectarios extraflorales en hojas jovenes seleccionadas al azar. Ademas, todas las defensas fueron comparadas para evaluar posibles compromisos o trade-offs durante la expansion de la hoja. No se encontraron trade-offs entre las defensasevaluadas, y la concentracion de todas las defensas, con excepcion de la tirosina, disminuyocon la expansion de la hoja. Se sugiere que las plantas continuaron aumentando el contenido fenolico y el contenido de saponina, pero a una velocidad menor que dio lugar a concentraciones decrecientes. En contraste, el contenido de tirosina por hoja aumento constantemente de tal manera que su concentracion se mantuvo constante, independientemente del tamano de hojas jovenes. La produccion de nectar se mantuvo constante durante la expansion de las hojas, pero, dado que el area foliar joven aumento 10 veces, la inversion en el nectar extrafloral por area foliar disminuyo significativamente. Ademas, el area del nectario no cambio durante la expansion de la hoja y por lo tanto, el tamano relativo del nectario disminuyo significativamente durante la expansion de las hojas jovenes.
   Estos resultados demuestran que las hojas mas jovenes tienen una mayor inversion en defensas multiples, muy probablemente debido a que tienen el mayor contenido de nitrogeno y son los mas susceptibles a una gran diversidad de herbivoros.

AB Ceiba pentandra is a tropical tree with high rates of selfing in some populations. In mixed-mating species, variation in selfing is due to changes in adult density or variability of incompatibility systems. The effect of spatial isolation and phenology on selfing rates and pollen flow distances was analyzed using microsatellites in a fragmented population of Ceiba pentandra, in southern Costa Rica. Adult trees within a heterogeneous landscape were classified as grouped or isolated. We compared selfing rates at the individual level, between isolation conditions and 2yr (2007, 2009), which differed in the number of flowering individuals. Mixed mating was estimated in both years (tm=0.6240.759). Trees mated predominantly by outcrossing, while only a few trees reproduced through selfing. Spatial isolation did not significantly affect outcrossing rates. The progeny of grouped trees was mostly sired by near-neighbors (<1km) and by long-distance pollen flow events in isolated trees. A reduction in the number of flowering individuals in 2009 reduced near-neighbor matings, increased selfing in grouped trees, and decreased the number of unsampled sires in the progeny. Comparing selfing rates on individuals that flowered in both reproductive periods suggests a flexible mating system. Variation in self-fertilization rates in this population appears to depend on variation of individual traits, such as genetic variability in self-incompatibility genes, but it is independent of landscape heterogeneity. In contrast, pollen flow distances depend on local tree density as bats concentrate their foraging between near individuals to maximize energy efficiency. Resumen Ceiba pentandra es uno de los raros ejemplos de arboles tropicales de dosel en los cuales se ha determinado altas tasas de selfing en algunas poblaciones. Analisis de plantas con sistema de apareamiento mixto ha mostrado que la frecuencia de selfing es variable entre individuos, poblaciones y periodos reproductivos, y en algunos casos esa variacion ha sido asociada a cambios en la densidad de individuos reproductivos, agentes polinizadores, variacion genetica o flexibilidad del sistema de incompatibilidad. En este estudio se analiza la variacion de las tasas de selfing y la distancia de dispersion de polen en una poblacion fragmentada de Ceiba pentandra en el SO de Costa Rica, con el fin de determinar el efecto del aislamiento espacial y fenologico sobre su sistema de apareamiento. Muestras de tejido adulto y semillas fueron obtenidas de una poblacion de arboles distribuidos en un area extensa de bosques fragmentados y pastizales durante dos anos reproductivos que mostraron diferencias en la frecuencia de individuos en floracion. Algunos individuos se encontraban en condicion agrupada y otros aislada, lo que permitio determinar el efecto de aislamiento sobre la tasas de autofecundacion y flujo genico por polen. Se determinaron las tasas de selfing por individuo, condicion de aislamiento y ano reproductivo, asi como la paternidad de las semillas con base a modelos de asignacion que consideran la presencia de individuos no muestreados. La poblacion estudiada mostro un sistema de apareamiento mixto en los dos anos estudiados (tm=0.7590.624). La mayoria de los arboles mostraron altas tasas de exocruzamiento, con una fraccion menor mostrando valores intermedios o bajos. Arboles con valores altos y bajos de la tasa de exocruzamiento se observaron tanto en condicion agrupada como aislada.
   La fraccion exocruzada de la progenie provino en su mayor parte de arboles cercanos (<1km) en el caso de las semillas de individuos en grupos, y de arboles distantes en el caso de los arboles aislados. La menor floracion del segundo ano de estudio provoco una disminucion en la frecuencia de apareamientos con individuos cercanos, un aumento en la tasa de selfing en algunos arboles agrupados, asi como una disminucion del numero de donadores de polen no muestreados. La comparacion de individuos muestreados en dos anos mostro flexibilidad del sistema de apareamiento en algunos de los individuos muestreados. La variacion de la tasa de selfing en esta poblacion parece depender de la variacion de caracteristicas individuales de los arboles no asociadas al grado de su grado de aislamiento espacial o fenologico, como por ejemplo variacion en genes del sistema de incompatibilidad. Al contrario de esto, los patrones de flujo de polen de la fraccion exocruzada de las semillas depende de la densidad local de la especie, ya que los murcielagos concentran su forrajeo en individuos cercanos como estrategia energeticamente mas favorable.

AB Mistletoes rely on birds for seed dispersal, but the presumed importance of mistletoe-specialist frugivores has not been critically examined nor compared with generalist frugivores and opportunistic foragers. The contribution of these three groups was compared directly by quantifying bird visitation to fruiting mistletoe plants ( Oryctanthus occidentalis: Loranthaceae) at Barro Colorado Island, Panama, and by comparing these results with proportions calculated from other empirical studies of mistletoe visitation conducted elsewhere. After more than 100h of timed watches, 23 bird species were recorded visiting eight heavily infected host trees ( Luehea seemannii: Tiliaceae). Eight of these species visited mistletoe, of which five (all tyrannids) consumed mistletoe fruit. Although two mistletoe specialist frugivores ( Tyrannulus elatus and Zimmerius vilissimus) removed most fruit (73%), more than a quarter was consumed by one generalist frugivore ( Mionectes oleagineus) and two opportunists ( Myiozetetes cayanensis and Myiozetetes similis). Post consumption behaviour varied: the specialists flew from mistletoe to mistletoe, the generalist rested in the subcanopy and understory, and the opportunists spent most time hawking insects and resting high in the canopy. Integrating these data with previous work, the dietary specialization, short gut passage rate and strict habitat preferences of mistletoe specialists suggests that their services relate primarily to intensification and contagious dispersal, while species with broader diets are more likely to visit uninfected trees and establish new infections. The presumed importance of mistletoe-specialist frugivores was not supported and mistletoes are considered to be comparable to many other bird-dispersed plants, relying on both specialist and generalist frugivores, while opportunists may be disproportionately important in long-distance dispersal.

AB Fig trees ( Ficus spp.) and Agaonine fig-wasps participate in an obligate mutualism. Fig wasps can only develop within fig inflorescences (syconia) and they are the only organisms capable of pollinating fig flowers. Other non-pollinating wasps that lay eggs by inserting their ovipositors from the outside can also develop in syconia. These parasitic wasps may be parasitoids of either pollinating or other non-pollinating wasps, or form galls in fig flowers or other tissues. Depending on this interaction, parasitic wasps may have various effects on the production of pollinating wasps and seeds. Wasps in the genus Idarnes, which parasitize New World figs (subgenus Urostigma), have an effect on wasp production but not on seed production. Heterandrium spp., which have short ovipositors and lay on external flowers, are infrequent and no effect on seed production has been documented. In the Colombian Andes, Idarnes spp. and Heterandrium spp. are the most frequent parasites of the Ficus andicola Pegoscapus sp. mutualism, affecting 62 and 43 percent of syconia, respectively. Controlling for other factors that influence wasp and seed production, such as number of foundresses, syconium size and tree, we found that Idarnes reduced pollinator production by almost half but did not reduce seed production, whereas Heterandrium reduced seed production by 40 percent, and marginally affected pollinator production. Our results provide the first clear documentation of Heterandrium spp. impact on fig seed production. Whether the relative abundance of this genus is a generalized phenomenon in montane forest remains to be determined. Resumen Los arboles del genero Ficus y las avispas de la subfamilia Agaoninae participan en un mutualismo obligado. Estas avispas solo pueden desarrollarse dentro de las inflorescencias (siconos) de estos arboles y son practicamente los unicos organismos que pueden fecundar sus flores. Otras avispas no polinizadoras ponen huevos en los siconos, insertando sus ovipositores a traves de la pared externa. Estas avispas parasitas pueden ser parasitoides de las polinizadoras o de otras avispas no polinizadoras, o formar agallas en las flores u otros tejidos. Dependiendo de esta interaccion, las avispas parasitas pueden tener efectos sobre la produccion de avispas polinizadoras y de semillas. Las avispas del genero Idarnes son parasitos en Ficus del Nuevo Mundo del subgenero Urostigma. Algunos estudios han demostrado que estas afectan la produccion de avispas polinizadoras, pero no afectan la produccion de semillas. Las avispas del genero Heterandrium, las cuales tienen ovipositores cortos y ponen sus huevos en las flores mas cercanas a la pared del sicono, son poco comunes y no se ha documentado un efecto claro sobre la produccion de semillas. En el mutualismo entre Ficus andicola y Pegoscapus sp. en los Andes de Colombia, Idarnes spp. y Heterandrium spp. son las avispas parasitas mas comunes y parasitan respectivamente 62% y 43% de los siconos. Teniendo en cuenta otros factores que influyen la produccion de avispas polinizadoras y semillas, como son el numero de avispas fundadoras, el tamano del sicono y el arbol, encontramos que Idarnes redujo la produccion de polinizadores casi a la mitad, pero no tuvo efecto sobre la produccion de semillas. Por su parte Heterandrium redujo la produccion de semillas en 40% y tuvo un efecto marginal sobre los polinizadores. Estos resultados proveen la primera documentacion clara del impacto de avispas del genero Heterandrium sobre la produccion de semillas.
   Falta por determinarse si la abundancia relativa de este genero es un fenomeno generalizado en los bosques montanos.

AB The dependence of mistletoes on few dispersers and the directed dispersal they provide is well known, yet no recent work has quantified either the effectiveness of these legitimate' dispersers, or the extent of redundancy among them. Here, I use the seed dispersal effectiveness (SDE) framework to analyze how birds (Mionectes striaticollis and Zimmerius bolivianus) contribute to mistletoe (Struthanthus acuminatus and Phthirusa retroflexa) infection in traditional mixed plantations within a humid montane forest in Bolivia. I calculated SDE for each birdmistletoe pair and for the disperser assemblage, by estimating both the quantity and the quality of dispersal. The quantity of dispersal was measured as: (1) disperser abundance; (2) frequency of visits; and (3) number of seeds dispersed per visit, and the quality of dispersal was measured as: (1) germination percentage and speed of germination of seeds regurgitated by birds; and (2) the concordance of deposited seeds and seedling distribution patterns with adult mistletoe distribution at three scales (habitat, host, and microhabitat). Dispersers were not redundant: the more generalist species M. striaticollis dispersed more seeds, but provided lower quality seed dispersal, whereas the mistletoe specialist Z. bolivianus provided low-quantity and high-quality seed dispersal. Whereas S. acuminatus benefited more from the SDE of Z. bolivianus, P. retroflexa benefited from the complementary seed dispersal provided by both birds. These results demonstrate how sympatric mistletoes that share the same disperser assemblage may develop different relationships with specific vectors, and describe how the services provided by two different dispersers (one that provides high-quality and one that provides high-quantity dispersal) interact to shape spatial patterns of plants. Resumen El que los muerdagos dependan de pocos dispersores y de la dispersion directa que estos proveen, es un fenomeno bastante conocido, sin embargo no existen estudios recientes que cuantifiquen la efectividad de estos dispersores legitimos', o el grado de redundancia entre ellos. Aqui utilizo el marco teorico de efectividad de dispersion de semillas (SDE) para analizar como las aves (Mionectes striaticollis y Zimmerius bolivianus) contribuyen a la infeccion por muerdagos (Struthanthus acuminatus y Phthirusa retroflexa) en plantaciones mixtas tradicionales dentro de un bosque humedo montano de Bolivia. Calcule el SDE para cada par ave-muerdago y para el ensamble de dispersores, estimando la cantidad de dispersion medida como (1) la abundancia de dispersores, (2) la frecuencia de visitas y (3) el numero de semillas dispersadas por visita, y la calidad de dispersion medida como (1) el porcentaje y la velocidad de germinacion de semillas regurgitadas por aves y (2) la concordancia de semillas depositadas y de plantulas de lorantaceas con los patrones de distribucion de muerdagos adultos en tres escalas (habitat, hospedero y microhabitat). Los dispersores no son redundantes, la especie mas generalista M. striaticollis dispersa mas semillas pero provee dispersion de baja calidad, mientras que el especialista en muerdagos Z. bolivianus provee dispersion de baja cantidad y alta calidad. Mientras S. acuminatus se beneficia del SDE que provee un dispersor (Z. bolivianus), P. retroflexa se beneficia de la dispersion complementaria que proveen ambas aves.
   Estos resultados ejemplifican como muerdagos simpatricos, que comparten el mismo ensamble de dispersores, pueden desarrollar diferentes relaciones con determinados vectores, y describe como los servicios de dispersion provistos por dos dispersores diferentes (uno que provee alta cantidad y uno alta calidad de dispersion) interactuan para modelar los patrones espaciales de las plantas que dispersan.

AB The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of ants as secondary seed dispersers of six primarily bird-dispersed Miconia species in the cerrados of southeastern Brazil. Vertebrate exclosure and seed germination experiments were performed for M. albicans, M. alborufescens, M. corallina, M. ferruginata, M. ibaguensis, and M. irwinii. Excluding vertebrates did not significantly alter fruit removal rate for any of the Miconia species relative to open controls. Fruits on stalks and fallen fruits were removed and transported to nests mainly by species of Atta, Acromyrmex, and Ectatomma (dispersal distance ranging from 0.1 to 45.2m), while Camponotus ants tended to be observed removing the fruit pulp (seed cleaning) where the fruits were found. Seed manipulation by Atta decreased germination of M. irwinii, but not M. ferruginata. Germination did not occur in intact fruits, and thus seed cleaning was an important service provided by the ants. Ant nest soils did not inhibit germination of any of the Miconia species, suggesting they are a good substrate for long-lived Miconia seeds. We conclude that ant activity could have important effects on the fate of Miconia seeds adapted for bird dispersal. Resumo O objetivo deste estudo foi avaliar o papel de formigas como dispersoras secundarias de sementes de seis especies ornitocoricas de Miconia em um cerrado no sudeste brasileiro. Experimentos de exclusAo de vertebrados e de germinacAo de sementes foram realizados para M. albicans, M. alborufescens, M. corallina, M. ferruginata, M. ibaguensis e M. irwinii. A exclusAo de vertebrados nAo alterou a taxa de remocAo de frutos para nenhuma especie de Miconia em relacAo ao controle aberto. Frutos nos pedicelos e caidos ao solo foram removidos e transportados para os ninhos de especies de Atta, Acromyrmex, e Ectatomma (distancias de dispersAo variando entre 0,1 a 45,2m), enquanto especies de Camponotus foram observadas despolpando as sementes nos locais onde encontraram os frutos. A manipulacAo das sementes por Atta diminuiu a germinacAo de M. irwinii, mas nAo de M. ferruginata. A germinacAo nAo ocorreu dentro de frutos intactos e, portanto, a limpeza de sementes e um importante servico fornecido pelas formigas. Os solos dos formigueiros nAo inibiram a germinacAo de sementes de nenhuma especie de Miconia, sugerindo que estes sAo bons substratos para as sementes longevas de Miconia. Concluimos que a atividade de formigas pode ter importantes efeitos sobre o destino das sementes de Miconia adaptadas para a dispersAo por aves.

AB The interplay between generalized and specialized plantanimal interactions is a core concept in understanding the evolution of mutualisms. Within the Eastern Caribbean, Heliconia bihai is a dominant forest species in the southern island of St. Vincent where H. caribaea is virtually absent. Heliconia caribaea is most common on the northern island of St. Kitts where H. bihai is restricted to the tops of the highest peaks. Both species are abundant on the central island of Dominica. We compared flowering patterns, nectar characteristics, and visitation frequency of hummingbirds in the two heliconias on the three islands to determine the extent of geographic variations in this plantpollinator mutualism. The peak flowering season of the two heliconias was observed to be in AprilMay on all three islands with little within- and between-island variations. Nectar production significantly varied between species and between islands. Visitation patterns by the principal hummingbird pollinators also varied between the islands: (1) on Dominica, only females of a single species of hummingbird pollinated the flowers of H. bihai (sexual specialization), whereas both sexes of the same hummingbird pollinated the flowers of H. caribaea (species specialization); (2) on St. Vincent, both sexes of the same hummingbird pollinated the flowers of H. bihai (species specialization); and (3) on St. Kitts, only females pollinated the flowers of H. bihai (sexual specialization), whereas several species of hummingbird visited the flowers of H. caribaea (species generalization). We propose that the Heliconiahummingbird interactions in the Eastern Caribbean represent a geographically variable coevolutionary mosaic of plantpollinator interactions.

AB The freshwater fauna (crustaceans, molluscs, fish) of many tropical islands in the Caribbean and Pacific share an amphidromous life-cycle, meaning their larvae need to develop in saline conditions before returning to freshwater as juveniles. This community dominates the freshwaters of much of the tropics, but is poorly known and at risk from development, in particular dam construction. Amphidromy can theoretically lead to dispersal between different freshwater areas, even to distant oceanic islands, via the sea. The extent and scale of this presumed dispersal, however, is largely unknown in the Caribbean. Recent genetic work in Puerto Rico has shown that many freshwater species have little or no population structure among different river catchments, implying high levels of connectivity within an island, whereas between-island structure is unknown. We used genetic techniques to infer the geographic scales of population structure of amphidromous invertebrates (a gastropod and a number of crustacean species) between distant parts of the Caribbean, in particular Puerto Rico, Panama and Trinidad. We found virtually no geographic population structure across over 2000km of open sea for these freshwater species. This implies that they are indeed moving between islands in sea currents as larvae, meaning that continued recruitment requires a continuum of healthy habitat from the freshwater to marine environment. We further discuss the role of amphidromy and suggest its ecological and biogeographic role may be more important than previously presumed. Resumen La fauna de agua dulce (crustaceos, moluscos, peces) de algunas islas tropicales en el Caribe y Pacifico comparte un ciclo de vida anfidromo, lo que significa que deben desarrollar sus larvas en condiciones salinas antes de volver al agua dulce como juveniles. Esta comunidad domina las aguas dulces de gran parte de los tropicos, pero es poco conocida y en riesgo de no poder continuar completando su ciclo vital, en particular, por a la construccion de represas. Debido a la relacion con el mar, este proceso de anfidromia teoricamente puede conducir a la dispersion entre las distintas areas de agua dulce a traves del el oceano, lo cual parece probable para islas oceanicas lejanas. Sin embargo, el alcance y la magnitud de esta aparente dispersion son desconocidos en el Caribe. Estudios geneticos recientes llevados a cabo en Puerto Rico mostraron que muchas especies de agua dulce tienen poca o ninguna estructura poblacional entre diferentes cuencas fluviales, lo que implica altos nivele de conectividad dentro de una isla, mientras que entre islas la estructura es desconocida. Nosotros utilizamos tecnicas geneticas para inferir las escalas geograficas de la estructura poblacional de invertebrados anfidromos (un gasteropodo y algunas especies de crustaceos) entre partes distantes del Caribe, en particular, Puerto Rico, Panama y Trinidad. No se encontro practicamente ninguna estructuracion geografica en las poblaciones separadas por mas de 2000km de mar abierto para estas especies de agua dulce. Esto implica que en realidad las diferentes poblaciones de estas especies estan en movimiento en forma de larvas entre islas mediante las corrientes marinas. La persistencia de un reclutamiento continuo de estas especies requiere la existencia de habitat saludable que mantenga la conexion entre los ecosistemas de agua dulce y marinos. Tambien discutimos el papel de la anfidromia y sugerimos que su papel ecologico y biogeografico puede ser mas importante de lo que se presume.

AB We investigate the role of ecology and phylogeny in the association between lizard abundance and microhabitat variables in an Amazon rain forest site. Using pitfall trap arrays, we collected data from 349 individuals belonging to 23 lizard species. After accounting for spatial autocorrelation and using a canonical correspondence analysis (CCA), we found that lizard captures were significantly associated with microhabitat variables, which accounted for 48 percent of the observed variation. Furthermore, a canonical phylogenetic ordination (CPO) indicated that microhabitat variables are more important in determining the distribution of lizard species than phylogenetic relationships among species. Termite nests, canopy openness, and tree circumference were strongly associated with the number of captures of certain lizard species. Our results confirm autecology studies of individual lizard species for which data are available. We suggest that maintaining heterogeneous forested microhabitats should be a central goal for sustaining a high lizard biodiversity in Amazon rain forests. Resumo Nos investigamos os papeis da ecologia e da filogenia na associacAo entre a abundancia de lagartos e variaveis do microhabitat em uma area de Floresta Amazonica. Com o auxilio de armadilhas de queda, nos coletamos dados de 349 individuos de 23 especies de lagartos. Depois de controlar os efeitos da autocorrelacAo espacial e empregando uma Analise de Correspondencia Canonica (CCA), nos verificamos que as capturas de lagartos foram significativamente associadas as variaveis de microhabitat, que explicaram 48 por cento da variacAo observada. Alem disso, uma OrdenacAo Filogenetica Canonica (CPO) indicou que as variaveis do microhabitat sAo mais importantes na determinacAo da distribuicAo das especies de lagartos que as relacoes filogeneticas entre as especies. Cupinzeiros, abertura do dossel e circunferencia das arvores foram fortemente correlacionados com a ocorrencia de determinadas especies. Nossos resultados confirmam estudos de autoecologia de especies de lagartos para os quais existem dados disponiveis. Nos sugerimos que a manutencAo de microhabitats heterogeneos deve ser um objetivo central para manter a alta diversidade de lagartos na Floresta Amazonica.

AB Habitat fragmentation and loss affect population stability and demographic processes, increasing the extinction risk of species. We studied Anolis heterodermus populations inhabiting large and small Andean scrubland patches in three fragmented landscapes in the Sabana de Bogota (Colombia) to determine the effect of habitat fragmentation and loss on population dynamics. We used the capture-mark-recapture method and multistate models to estimate vital rates for each population. We estimated growth population rate and the most important processes that affect by elasticity analysis of vital rates. We tested the effects of habitat fragmentation and loss on vital rates of lizard populations. All six isolated populations showed a positive or an equilibrium growth rate (=1), and the most important demographic process affecting was the growth to first reproduction. Populations from landscapes with less scrubland natural cover showed higher stasis of young adults. Populations in highly fragmented landscapes showed highest juvenile survival and growth population rates. Independent of the landscape's habitat configuration and connectivity, populations from larger scrubland patches showed low adult survivorship, but high transition rates. Populations varied from a slow strategy with low growth and delayed maturation in smaller patches to a fast strategy with high growth and early maturation in large patches. This variation was congruent with the fast-slow continuum hypothesis and has serious implications for Andean lizard conservation and management strategies. We suggest that more stable lizard populations will be maintained if different management strategies are adopted according to patch area and habitat structure. Resumen La perdida y fragmentacion del habitat afectan la estabilidad de las poblaciones y los procesos demograficos aumentando el riesgo de extincion. Estudiamos poblaciones de Anolis heterodermus que habitan fragmentos de matorral andino grandes y pequenos en tres paisajes de la Sabana de Bogota (Colombia), con el objeto de analizar los efectos de la perdida y fragmentacion en la dinamica poblacional. Estimamos las tasas vitales usando metodos de marcaje y recaptura y modelos multiestado. Por medio de analisis de elasticidades estimamos la tasa intrinseca de crecimiento poblacional y los procesos mas importantes para .Probamos los efectos de la perdida y fragmentacion del habitat sobre las tasas vitales de las poblaciones de lagartijas. Las seis poblaciones aisladas presentaron una tasa de crecimiento poblacional positiva (1) y el proceso demografico que mas contribuyo a fue el crecimiento a la primera reproduccion. Encontramos que en las poblaciones de paisajes con menos cantidad de habitat, la permanencia de los adultos fue mas alta. Las poblaciones provenientes de paisajes mas fragmentados exhibieron tasas se supervivencia de juveniles y de crecimiento poblacional mas altas. Independientemente de la configuracion y conectividad del habitat en el paisaje, las poblaciones de los fragmentos mas grandes presentaron tasas de supervivencia de adultos mas bajas pero tasas de transicion mas altas. Detectamos una variacion de la estrategia demografica en las poblaciones desde una estrategia lenta con bajo crecimiento y madurez tardia en los fragmentos mas pequenos hasta una rapida con alto crecimiento y madurez temprana en los fragmentos grandes. La variacion observada se ajusto a la hipotesis del continuo rapido-lento presentando serias implicaciones para las acciones de conservacion de lagartijas andinas.
   Sugerimos que las poblaciones mas estables se pueden mantener bajo diferentes estrategias de manejo teniendo en cuenta el tamano y la estructura del habitat.

AB Forest cover change directly affects biodiversity, the global carbon budget, and ecosystem function. Within Latin American and the Caribbean region (LAC), many studies have documented extensive deforestation, but there are also many local studies reporting forest recovery. These contrasting dynamics have been largely attributed to demographic and socio-economic change. For example, local population change due to migration can stimulate forest recovery, while the increasing global demand for food can drive agriculture expansion. However, as no analysis has simultaneously evaluated deforestation and reforestation from the municipal to continental scale, we lack a comprehensive assessment of the spatial distribution of these processes. We overcame this limitation by producing wall-to-wall, annual maps of change in woody vegetation and other land-cover classes between 2001 and 2010 for each of the 16,050 municipalities in LAC, and we used nonparametric Random Forest regression analyses to determine which environmental or population variables best explained the variation in woody vegetation change. Woody vegetation change was dominated by deforestation (541,835km2), particularly in the moist forest, dry forest, and savannas/shrublands biomes in South America. Extensive areas also recovered woody vegetation (+362,430km2), particularly in regions too dry or too steep for modern agriculture. Deforestation in moist forests tended to occur in lowland areas with low population density, but woody cover change was not related to municipality-scale population change. These results emphasize the importance of quantitating deforestation and reforestation at multiple spatial scales and linking these changes with global drivers such as the global demand for food. Resumen Los cambios en la cobertura de bosque tienen efectos directos sobre la biodiversidad, el ciclo global del carbono, y el funcionamiento de los ecosistemas. Muchos estudios en la region de America Latina y el Caribe han documentado extensa deforestacion; sin embargo, existen estudios locales que reportan recuperacion del bosque. Ambas dinamicas, deforestacion y reforestacion, han sido relacionadas con cambios demograficos y socioeconomicos. Por ejemplo, dinamicas poblacionales, como la migracion rural urbana, pueden estimular la recuperacion del bosque, mientras que el aumento en la demanda mundial de alimentos puede promover la expansion agricola. Dado a que ningun estudio ha evaluado conjuntamente los procesos de deforestacion y reforestacion a escala municipal o regional, no existe un analisis sobre de la distribucion espacial de estos procesos. Hemos superado esta limitacion al producir, simultaneamente, mapas del cambio en las coberturas de vegetacion lenosa y usos del suelo entre 2001 y 2010 para cada uno de los 16,050municipios de America Latina. Se utilizo el analisis no parametrico de regresion Random Forest para determinar cuales de las variables demograficas o medioambientales explican la variacion del cambio en vegetacion lenosa. Los cambios mas significativos en la cobertura de vegetacion lenosa fueron causados por procesos de deforestacion (541,835km2), particularmente en los biomas de bosque humedo, bosque seco, y en las sabanas o matorrales de America del Sur. Igualmente, se registro un aumento en la cobertura de vegetacion lenosa (362,430km2), especialmente en zonas aridas o empinados poco favorables para la agricultura industrial.
   La deforestacion en los bosques humedos tiende a ocurrir en zonas de baja elevacion y de poca densidad poblacional, sin embargo, los cambios en vegetacion lenosa no estuvieron relacionados con cambios en poblacion a nivel de municipio. Estos resultados enfatizan la importancia de cuantificar la deforestacion y la reforestacion a multiples escalas espaciales y de vincular estos cambios con acontecimientos globales, como el incremento mundial en la demanda de alimentos.

AB Although there are generalized conceptual models that predict how above and belowground biomass increase during secondary succession after abandonment from agriculture, there are few data to test these models for fine roots (defined as <= 2 mm diameter) in tropical forests. We measured live and dead fine roots (0-10 cm depth) in 18 plots of regenerating tropical dry forest in Costa Rica that varied in age from 5 to 60 yrs, as well as in soil properties. We predicted that both stand age and soil fertility would affect fine roots, with greater values in older forests on low fertility soils. Across two sampling dates and locations, live fine roots varied from 0.35 to 3.53 Mg/ha and dead roots varied from 0.15 to 0.93 Mg/ha. Surprisingly, there was little evidence that surface fine roots varied between sampling dates or in relation to stand age. By contrast, total, live, and dead fine roots averaged across sampling dates within plots were negatively correlated with a multivariate index of soil fertility (Pearson correlations coefficients were -0.64, -0.58, and -0.68, respectively; P<0.01) and other individual edaphic variables including pH, silt, calcium, magnesium, nitrogen, and phosphorus. These results suggest that soil fertility is a more important determinant of fine roots than forest age in tropical dry forests in Costa Rica, and that one-way these plant communities respond to low soil fertility is by increasing fine roots. Thus, simple conceptual models of forest responses to abandonment from agriculture may not be appropriate for surface fine roots.

AB Recent assessments of biodiversity in tropical agroecosystems have revealed surprisingly high functional and taxonomic diversity in systems with low management intensity. This biodiversity is the product of community assembly. Because agroecosystems are novel ecosystems and occur in landscape mosaics, the assembly processes generating communities in agroecosystems are poorly resolved. Broadly, two models have been proposed to explain landscape assembly: trade-offs in species performance across habitats (species sorting) and source-sink dynamics between habitats of differential quality (mass effects). These models are largely untested in tropical agroecosystems. We utilize an extensive data set on a tropical twig-nesting ant community from five microhabitat types in a shaded coffee agroecosystem to test for species sorting, mass effects, or a mixed model. To test among these models, we used community similarity and a variance decomposition on a focal microhabitat (a moderate-shade coffee farm) to partition community variance into spatial and environmental components. To identify the source habitat for mass effects and assess their strength, we measured dispersing alates (winged reproductives), artificial nests, and colony and nest size in shade trees and coffee. We found significant environmental and spatial signal and evidence for both species sorting and mass effects. We find sorting occurs among common species, but that mass effects are prevalent among rare species and likely originate in the shade trees. Our results indicate that both metacommunity models occur in tropical landscape mosaics, but they may not apply equally to all species in communities, habitat gradients, or timescales.

AB In this study, we aimed to assess the processes controlling compositional change in a Northern Andean paramo highly affected by human-induced disturbances over the last few decades (La Rusia, Colombia). Along the 3000-3800 m asl altitudinal range, we randomly sampled fifty 10 x 10 m plots. Therein, we measured altitude and variables related to soil conditions (i.e., moisture, nutrient contents, bulk density, and texture), occurrence of human-induced disturbances (i.e., fire, vegetation clearing, potato cultivation, and cattle grazing), and land-use history. We also recorded richness and abundance of plant species, identifying them as exotic or native. We differentiated four groups of plots according to their species composition. The groups had significant differences in altitude, soil conditions, land-use history, and particularly, in richness of exotic species and exotic/native cover ratio. They could be ascribed to shrub-and grass-paramo vegetation types based on their relative dominance of woody and herbaceous species; however, these groups were not arranged according to the hypothetical composition of altitudinal belts, but rather formed a mosaic of patches. This mosaic was determined not only by altitude but also by soil conditions and disturbance history of sites. Our results corroborate recent findings which highlight shrub-and grass-paramo vegetation types as patches of contrasting species composition and structure that depend on local environmental variables, as well as human-induced disturbances as a major determinant of compositional discontinuities in these 'high mountain' tropical ecosystems.

AB Global change puts an increasing pressure on tropical forests and their inherent diversity by the risk of longer droughts and drier microclimatic conditions within the forest. How organisms will respond is uncertain, especially for organisms highly depending on their microclimatic environment such as bryophytes. An adequate tolerance to desiccation is important to face these changes, however, little is known for tropical bryophytes. We investigated for the first time the desiccation tolerance of epiphytic bryophytes from contrasting microsites at the tropical lowland forest in French Guiana. Using chlorophyll-fluorescence (F-v/F-m) as an indicator of recovery, we tested: (1) desiccation tolerance for short (3 d) and long (9 d) desiccation events; (2) different desiccation intensities; and (3) recovery by rehydration with water vapor. Species from the canopy were well adapted to desiccation events. Thirteen of 18 species maintained more than 75 percent of their photosynthetic capacity after recovery at the strongest desiccation treatment of 9 d at 43 percent relative humidity (RH). In contrast, species from the understory were sensitive and withstood desiccation only at humid conditions of 75 percent RH and higher. The photosystem of the studied bryophytes was reactivated efficiently in equilibration with water vapor only-a yet neglected phenomenon in bryology. A novel introduced desiccation tolerance index allows global comparison of desiccation tolerances and highlights the sensitivity of understory species. Our results suggest that decreasing humidity caused by climate change and forest degradation could be a concerning threat for understory species.

AB Forest fragmentation is pervasive in tropical landscapes, and one pathway by which fragmentation may negatively impact populations is via edge effects. Early life-stages are particularly important for species regeneration as they act as bottlenecks, but how edge effects may act differentially on different life-stages is unknown. This study evaluated edge effects on multiple early life-stages of a currently common animal-dispersed, shade-tolerant tree Tapirira mexicana (Anacardiaceae). The study was conducted in tropical premontane wet forest fragments in a highly deforested region of Costa Rica. The stages assessed were pre-dispersal predation, primary dispersal, post-dispersal predation, secondary dispersal, ex situ germination, in situ seed longevity, first and second year seedling abundance, second year seedling survivorship, and basal diameter growth. Results showed that impacts of edge effects were not equal across stages, but were limited to specific stages and times. One stage which may act as a bottleneck for species regeneration was pre-dispersal predation. Over 60 percent of the seeds were predated by larvae, and predation was higher near the edge than interior habitat. Seeds lost viability within 10 d in the forest. Germination to first year seedling stage was also lower near edges, but such effect was eliminated within a year after that. Primary dispersal, seedling survivorship, and growth were not affected by proximity to edges, and both secondary dispersal and post-dispersal predation were rare. This study demonstrates that current population abundance may not guarantee future species persistence and the importance of considering multiple life-stages for a comprehensive assessment of forest fragmentation effects on species regeneration.

AB Interactions between oil-collecting bees and oil-producing flowers are a very specialized mutualism, whose natural history is well known at the organism and population levels. In this study, we assessed these interactions at the biome level with a network approach, and hypothesized that widespread bee and plant species would occupy different ecological functional roles (Eltonian niches) in different biomes. Furthermore, we expected the most important functional roles in each network to be occupied more frequently by Byrsonima oil flowers and Centris oil bees, which share the longest coevolutionary history in the Neotropics. By compiling data from 40 articles on oil flower interactions within the Malpighiaceae family, we built six networks for different Brazilian biomes. We assessed the ecological functional role of each species in pollination networks of oil flowers through the metric known as 'network functional role'. Although 90 percent of the species occupied peripheral roles in each network, some were found to occupy highly central roles. Oil flowers of the genera Byrsonima and Banisteriopsis and oil bees of the genera Centris and Epicharis were the most important species in all networks, as they made a disproportionally high number of interactions (hubs), or helped bind together different modules (connectors). Our findings suggest that functional roles vary geographically and seem to be affected by local conditions in different biomes. Furthermore, coevolutionary history seems to play an important role in determining functional roles in oil flower networks, although other factors are probably also important, especially the degree of specialization in this kind of interaction.

AB Invertebrate communities of the tropical rain forest floor are highly diverse, characterized by patchy species distribution patterns and high variation in species density. Spatial variation in the foraging activity of swarm raiding army ants, prime invertebrate predators in tropical rain forests, is discussed as a mechanism contributing to these patterns, but highly resolved long-term data on army ant raiding on the local and landscape scale are hitherto lacking. In this study, 196 positions in 11 study sites in a tropical rain forest in western Kenya were continuously monitored over similar to 4 mo for the occurrence of swarm raids of army ants. Using population simulation analyses, the consequences of army ant raiding for prey communities were assessed. We found an unexpectedly high variation in raid rates at the study site and landscape scale. The weekly chance of communities to become raided by army ants was on average 0.11, but ranged from 0 to 0.50 among the 196 positions. Simulating population developments of two Lotka-Volterra species-showing slight trade-offs between competitive strength and resistance to army ant raids-in the real raiding landscapes showed that the observed spatial variation in raid rates may produce high prey diversity at larger spatial scales (due to high beta-diversity) and strong variation in species density. Our results indicate that high spatial variation in army ant swarm raiding is a mechanism capable of generating patchy species distribution patterns and maintaining the high biodiversity of invertebrate communities of the tropical rain forest floor.

AB Evidence suggests that variations along ecological gradients shape organism traits such as behavior or morphometry. We studied the effect of altitude on the flight activity of tropical tabanid fly assemblages of one species of Stypommisa Enderlein along a 1 km altitudinal gradient on the northwestern slopes of the Ecuadorian Andes. Our objectives were as follows: (1) to test the hypothesis that highland individuals present larger flight body structures; and (2) to compare the flight activity patterns of flies' assemblages among altitudes and correlate it with weather factors. We sampled specimens in Malaise traps at 1180, 1680 and 2180 m of altitude from 0600 to 1830 h for 20 d at each site. Seven weather variables were measured every hour and flight activity was inferred from relative tabanid fly abundances/hour in traps. We measured morphometrical parameters that included tabanid fly body size, thorax volume, wing area and wing loading. Flight activity patterns revealed a bimodal distribution at 1680 m, and two asynchronous unimodal distributions, one at 1180 and one at 2180 m. GLM analyses revealed that temperature, mist and rainfall were the best predictors of fly activity differences among altitudes. Morphometrical analyses showed that body size and thorax volume increased with increasing altitude. Synchronous groups of flies at different altitudes (those between 1180-1680((pm)) m, and 1680((am))-2180 m) were morphologically similar, suggesting that flies could be capable of migrating from highlands to lowlands at defined hours of the day depending on forest weather conditions.

AB Several species of arthropods inhabiting forest fragments interact with managed areas. The importance of such areas to biodiversity conservation, however, is not well established. Communities of solitary wasps and bees (Insecta: Hymenoptera) play a key role in agroecosystem functioning and they have been used in studies of biodiversity assessment in different land-use types. We aimed to assess patterns of species richness and composition of solitary wasps and bees over a 1-yr period in a gradient of decreasing land-use intensity formed by pastures, alley croppings, young fallows, and old fallows using trap nests. Old fallows had the highest species richness of wasps and bees, harboring all bee species and 86 percent of wasp species occurring in the region, while the remaining land-uses had similar species richness. Vegetation structure (tree richness) and relative humidity explained most of the variance for the species richness of wasps. For bees, however, there was no influence of environmental factors on the community among land-use types, indicating better adaptability of this group to environmental variations related to land-use. The composition of solitary wasp communities (but not those of bees) differed among land-use types, and the occurrence of rare species in most cases was restricted to old fallow sites. In conclusion, the community of solitary wasps and bees is contingent on land-use, with solitary wasps more sensitive to anthropized areas. For both groups, less anthropized areas harbor a greater richness and number of rare species while more intensively managed land-use types harbor higher abundances.

AB The importance of terrestrial arthropods has been documented in temperate stream ecosystems, but little is known about the magnitude of these inputs in tropical streams. Terrestrial arthropods falling from the canopy of tropical forests may be an important subsidy to tropical stream food webs and could also represent an important flux of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in nutrient-poor headwater streams. We quantified input rates of terrestrial insects in eight streams draining lowland tropical wet forest in Costa Rica. In two focal headwater streams, we also measured capture efficiency by the fish assemblage and quantified terrestrially derived N- and P-excretion relative to stream nutrient uptake rates. Average input rates of terrestrial insects ranged from 5 to 41 mg dry mass/m(2)/d, exceeding previous measurements of aquatic invertebrate secondary production in these study streams, and were relatively consistent year-round, in contrast to values reported in temperate streams. Terrestrial insects accounted for half of the diet of the dominant fish species, Priapicthys annectens. Although terrestrially derived fish excretion was found to be a small flux relative to measured nutrient uptake rates in the focal streams, the efficient capture and processing of terrestrial arthropods by fish made these nutrients available to the local stream ecosystem. This aquatic-terrestrial linkage is likely being decoupled by deforestation in many tropical regions, with largely unknown but potentially important ecological consequences.

AB Animals that rely on refuges for safety can theoretically increase their foraging area without simultaneously increasing predation risk and travel costs by using more refuges. The key prediction of this theory, a negative correlation between food abundance, home range size and the number of refuges used, has never been empirically tested. We determined how home range size and refuge use by the Central American agouti (Dasyprocta punctata) varied across a gradient of abundance of the agoutis' principal food source: seeds and fruits of the palm Astrocaryum standleyanum. We used both manual and automated radio telemetry to measure space use of 11 agoutis during 2 mo of the Astrocaryum fruiting season, and of another set of 10 agoutis during 6 mo in which the animals largely relied on cached Astrocaryum seeds. We found that agoutis living in areas of lower food density had larger home ranges, and that all individuals used multiple refuges. The number of refuges, however, was not correlated with home range size. Consequently, agoutis that had larger home ranges roamed farther from their refuges. These results suggest that agoutis increase their home range size in response to food scarcity at the cost of their safety.
