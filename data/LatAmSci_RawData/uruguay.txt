TI Trophic mass-balance model of a subtropical coastal lagoon, including a
   comparison with a stable isotope analysis of the food-web
SO ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
DT Article
AB Stable isotopes and mass-balance trophic models (e.g., ECOPATH) are
   well-known and widely used approximations to describe food-web
   structure, but their consistency is not properly established. Here we
   analyze the food-web structure of a subtropical-temperate coastal lagoon
   using two approaches: stable isotopic techniques and mass-balance
   modelling, exploring also the correspondence between the outputs of both
   methods. We compared trophic positions (TPs) derived by these two
   approaches for 14 consumers in Laguna de Rocha (LR).TPs based on stable
   isotopes were taken from a recent study. ECOPATH trophic levels were
   estimated by a model presented here constructed based on field data for
   the period 2003-2006 and literature data. The model incorporated over 50
   species in 27 trophic groups, including primary producers, invertebrate
   and vertebrate consumers. The origin and quality of data (pedigree
   routine) indicated that 68% of the information was locally bound,
   although several unknowns were detected. Birds and mammals represented
   the highest trophic levels (4.2 and 3.98, respectively). Network
   analysis estimated a size of the system (fluxes and biomasses) of 451 t
   wet weight km(-2) year(-1), while transfer efficiency, primary
   production/respiration and production/biomass ratios, and several
   ecological indexes characterized LR as an underdeveloped system. TPs
   derived from isotopic analysis were highly correlated with trophic
   levels estimated by ECOPATH according to a linear regression model
   through the origin (r(2) = 0.82, n = 14, p << 0.01). The slope of the
   linear model (0.88 +/- 0.019, estimate +/- SD) indicated that TPs
   derived from isotopic analyses were slightly higher (similar to 13.5% on
   average) than those derived from the mass-balance model. Current results
   support the overall consistency of the use of both stable isotopes and
   mass-balance modelling approaches as descriptors of this aquatic
   food-web. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Trophic models in sandy beaches with contrasting morphodynamics
   Comparing ecosystem structure and biomass flow
SO ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
DT Article
AB We model and compare for the first time the ecosystem structure and
   trophic networks of two sandy beaches with contrasting morphodynamics (i
   e dissipative and reflective) To this end an Ecopath model was
   implemented to represent the macroscopic food web on each sandy beach
   ecosystem The dissipative beach model comprised 20 compartments and the
   reflective nine including detritus phyto plankton zooplankton benthic
   invertebrates fishes and seabirds Input data mainly came from direct
   surveys whereas additional information was gathered from published and
   unpublished sources Results revealed a major number of top predators and
   higher trophic levels (Us) in the dissipative beach (seabirds fishes
   gastropods and the polychaete Hemipodus olivieri) than in the reflective
   one (fishes and Hemipodus olivieri) Detritivorous and filter feeding
   benthic invertebrates constituted intermediate trophic levels on both
   beaches Exportation of most primary production and detritus was a common
   feature with a detritivory herbivory ratio of 0 42 in the dissipative
   beach and 0 51 in the reflective indicating a higher utilization of the
   primary production in the former The aggregation analysis showed five
   TLs in the dissipative beach and four in the reflective Lower transfer
   efficiencies in the reflective beach could be attributed to a lower
   diversity of predators when compared to the dissipative system
   Comparison of global ecosystem properties showed that the dissipative
   system had higher values for total system throughput total biomass net
   production Ascendency and total number of pathways We concluded that the
   greater diversity and biomass in the dissipative beach are reflected in
   a higher dimension and ecosystem organization than in the reflective
   beach thus providing new evidences at the ecosystem level about
   well-established differences in biological descriptors between beach
   types Finally we stressed the need for acquiring experimentally-based
   information on benthic invertebrate s consumption rates and the
   inclusion of the surf zone microbial loop and the interstitial
   compartment to test for differences in structure and functioning of
   these coastal ecosystems (C) 2010 Elsevier B V All rights reserved

TI Coexistence patterns of benthic gastropods on the Uruguayan shelf
SO OIKOS
DT Article
AB Community assembly rules theory attempt to understand the processes that
   determine the composition of local communities from a regional species
   pool. Nestedness and negative co-occurrence are two of the most commonly
   reported meta-community patterns, but almost exclusively from
   terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems. Here we analyzed the structure of
   species coexistence in six datasets containing presence/absence data for
   120 marine benthic gastropod species in 249 sampling units on the
   Uruguayan continental shelf and Rio de la Plata estuary. The ecological
   features of this system, such as the idiosyncratic nature of the
   biogeographic and oceanographic realms, are clearly different from those
   observed in other systems previously targeted by studies on coexistence
   structure. Community patterns were evaluated using null models and four
   structure indices. The existence of patterns in community assembly, and
   in particular segregated co-occurrence, was verified only when analyzing
   the number of checkerboard units (CH index). This indicates more
   mutually exclusive species pairs than expected by chance. Nestedness, on
   the other hand, was not detected in any dataset. Storage and rescue
   effects related to overall high immigration and low local extinction
   rates are plausible mechanisms to account for the general pattern of
   random species coexistence, while the segregated co-occurrence pattern
   depicted by the CH index may be related to differential habitat
   requirements within species pairs. Our study highlights the importance
   of analyzing metacommunity structures in alternative biological,
   environmental, and historical contexts in order to advance on the
   construction of a general ecological theory, relating patterns with the
   processes dominating in particular ecosystems.

TI Positive ecosystem engineering effects of the ant Atta vollenweideri on
   the shrub Grabowskia duplicata
SO JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE
DT Article
AB Question
   How does the ant Atta vollenweideri indirectly affect the shrub
   Grabowskia duplicata? Does environmental modification induced by nest
   building affect the life history and population structure of this
   dominant shrub?
   Location
   Halophytic savanna of western Uruguay, South America.
   Methods
   We compared the density of three shrub size classes, seedlings, saplings
   and adults, among patches created by ant nest building and in
   non-modified areas. We studied key soil properties for plant growth in
   both live nests and non-modified areas. We performed a greenhouse
   experiment to study the effects of soils (live nest versus non-modified
   area) on shrub germination probability. We also assessed vegetative
   propagation by measuring the incidence of root suckers and clonal
   offshoots in live nests and non-modified areas through a field survey.
   Results
   Seedling-size class was more abundant on live nests than in non-modified
   areas, suggesting that environmental conditions of this type of habitat
   (i.e. increased sodium and moisture content of soil, and decreased soil
   compaction) could facilitate shrub recruitment. We did not find any
   effects of soil type (live nests versus non-modified areas) on shrub
   germination probability. However, the vegetative propagation incidence
   was higher in the environment with live nests.
   Conclusions
   We found a strong indirect relationship between the ant A. vollenweideri
   and the shrub G. duplicata. This relationship seems to be mediated by an
   allogenic engineering process, i.e. soil bioturbation caused by nest
   building. The environmental conditions of live nests seem to facilitate
   shrub recruitment, mainly by increasing vegetative propagation.

SO BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS
DT Article
AB We report on the first sightings of the invasive Rapa Whelk Rapana
   venosa in Maldonado Bay (Punta del Este Harbor and Gorriti Island) using
   in vivo, underwater observations and video surveys. The species was
   first detected in the Rio de la Plata (Uruguay and Argentina) in 1999,
   and by 2004 it had extended its local distribution to Punta del Este at
   the eastern boundary of the estuary. Observations performed by SCUBA
   diving showed that R. venosa is preying on native mussels Mytilus edulis
   and Brachidontes spp., and that formerly abundant mussel beds are being
   seriously depleted due to a combination of human extraction, habitat
   deterioration and predation by the Rapa Whelk.

TI Membraniporopsis tubigera, an invasive bryozoan in sandy beaches of
   southern Brazil and Uruguay
SO BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS
DT Article
AB The massive irruption of the invasive bryozoan Membraniporopsis tubigera
   (Osburn) in sandy beaches of southern Brazil and Uruguay is reported.
   The species, originally described from Puerto Rico, Texas and Florida,
   has also been recorded for Brazilian beaches from 21A degrees S to 26A
   degrees S as well as for harbours of Australia, New Zealand and the Sea
   of Japan. The southward spreading rate of this bryozoan along the
   Brazilian and Uruguayan coasts can be estimated in approximately 183-195
   km year(-1). The chances that this invasion could proceed southwards in
   the Southwest Atlantic and the possible impacts that it may be causing
   are discussed. The case of M. tubigera seems to be qualitatively and
   quantitatively different from those of other alien bryozoans previously
   recorded for this region, since it appeared massively in exposed sandy
   beaches, a habitat regarded to date as apparently free from the
   pervasive ecological impact of invasion by exotic species in the
   Southwest Atlantic.

TI Spatial variability of above-ground net primary production in Uruguayan
   grasslands: a remote sensing approach
SO APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE
DT Article
AB Question: How does above-ground net primary production (ANPP) differ
   (estimated from remotely sensed data) among vegetation units in
   sub-humid temperate grasslands?
   Location: Centre-north Uruguay.
   Methods: A vegetation map of the study area was generated from LANDSAT
   imagery and the landscape configuration described. The functional
   heterogeneity of mapping units was analysed in terms of the fraction of
   photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by green vegetation (fPAR),
   calculated from the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) images
   provided by the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS)
   sensor. Finally, the ANPP of each grassland class was estimated using
   NDVI and climatic data.
   Results: Supervised classification presented a good overall accuracy and
   moderate to good average accuracy for grassland classes. Meso-xerophytic
   grasslands occupied 45% of the area, Meso-hydrophytic grasslands 43% and
   Lithophytic steppes 6%. The landscape was shaped by a matrix of large,
   unfragmented patches of Meso-xerophytic and Meso-hydrophytic grasslands.
   The region presented the lowest anthropic fragmentation degree reported
   for the Rio de la Plata grasslands. All grassland units showed bimodal
   annual fPAR seasonality, with spring and autumn peaks. Meso-hydrophytic
   grasslands showed a radiation interception 10% higher than the other
   units. On an annual basis, Meso-hydrophytic grasslands produced 3800 kg
   dry matter (DM) ha(-1) yr(-1) and Meso-xerophytic grasslands and
   Lithophytic steppes around 3400 kg.DM.ha(-1).yr(-1). Meso-xerophytic
   grasslands had the largest spatial variation during most of the year.
   The ANPP temporal variation was higher than the fPAR variability.
   Conclusions: Our results provide valuable information for grazing
   management (identifying spatial and temporal variations of ANPP) and
   grassland conservation (identifying the spatial distribution of
   vegetation units).

TI Gender-specific ageing and non-Mendelian inheritance of oxidative damage
   in marine copepods
SO MARINE ECOLOGY-PROGRESS SERIES
DT Article
AB Ageing in the marine pelagic copepod Acartia tonsa results in decreased
   feeding and production rates associated with an increase in the
   accumulation of protein oxidative damage, as predicted by the oxidative
   stress hypothesis. In laboratory experiments, we estimated sex-specific
   ageing effects on feeding and oxidative damage and on egg production
   rates of adult females. We also determined maternal effects on offspring
   by measuring egg hatching success and oxidative damage of nauplii from
   mothers of different ages. Males manifested more oxidative damage with
   age than females, providing an alternative explanation for the shorter
   life span in males. Older females produced fewer offspring, and nauplii
   with higher protein oxidative damage, than younger females. This study
   forms an empirical basis to link ageing, life span, sex differences and
   maternal fitness in animals that also reflects natural copepod
   population dynamics. Individual ageing processes and the resulting age
   structure in the population modulate mortality risk, parental effects on
   offspring performance, reproductive investment, and pelagic energy
   fluxes.

TI Effects of morphodynamic and estuarine gradients on the demography and
   distribution of a sandy beach mole crab: implications for source-sink
   habitat dynamics
RID D-4026-2009
SO MARINE ECOLOGY-PROGRESS SERIES
DT Article
AB Several conceptual models relating biological and morphodynamic
   variables have been developed in sandy beach ecology. On estuarine sandy
   beaches, a major environmental factor influencing macrofaunal
   distribution is salinity. In this setting, the concurrent role of
   large-scale estuarine and morphodynamic gradients in shaping demographic
   patterns is still uncertain. To explain largescale variations in
   demographic aspects of the mole crab Emerita brasiliensis, 16 Uruguayan
   sandy beaches distributed along the estuarine gradient generated by the
   Rio de la Plata were characterized in terms of beach morphology,
   sediment traits and salinity over a 2 yr period. Abundance (total and
   discriminated by reproductive and recruitment components), biomass and
   body size of E. brasiliensis significantly increased from estuarine
   reflective to oceanic dissipative beaches. Further, generalized models
   (both additive and linear) showed that salinity, mean grain size and
   swash width were the most important explanatory factors of
   spatio-temporal variations in abundance. Sexually mature individuals and
   megalopae were almost absent in estuarine and oceanic: reflective
   beaches, whereas oceanic dissipative beaches showed polymodal size
   structures with fully represented population components, together with
   extended reproductive and recruitment periods. We conclude that (1)
   morphodynamic and estuarine gradients are inextricably linked, affecting
   mole crab demography; and (2) estuarine and oceanic reflective beaches
   operate as sink habitats where populations do not prosper, whereas
   oceanic dissipative beaches act as source habitats. We thus provide
   empirical support to the source-sink hypothesis recently developed for
   sandy beaches. These long-term variations in demographic processes
   should be complemented by connectivity studies and genetic analyses in
   order to gain a deeper understanding of metapopulation dynamics in sandy
   beaches.

TI Food web structure and body size: trophic position and resource
   acquisition
RID B-7732-2009
SO OIKOS
DT Article
AB Ulrich Brose Body size is recognized as an important determinant of
   trophic structure as it affects individual energetic demands, population
   density, and the interaction between potential prey and predators.
   However, its relationship with trophic position remains unclear. It has
   been hypothesized that a positive relationship between body size and
   trophic position would be associated to some particular trophic
   structures, which would allow larger organisms to satisfy their
   energetic demand and sustain viable population sizes at higher trophic
   positions, where fewer resources are available. To test this hypothesis,
   we analyzed the diet of 619 killifishes from four species (Austrolebias
   cheradophilus, A. luteoflammulatus, A. viarius and Cynopoecilus
   melanotaenia), collected in temporary ponds occurring in the grasslands
   of Rocha, Uruguay. Trophic position, diet richness, number of energy
   sources, and evenness were estimated for 20 size classes, formed by
   consecutive groups of 31 individuals. Gape limitation and preference for
   the larger available prey were evaluated as explanations for observed
   patterns with an individual based model (IBM). In agreement with the
   hypothesis, killifishes presented a strong positive relationship between
   trophic position and body size (R2=0.86), associated with a trophic
   structure that could allow larger organisms to have access to more
   energy from the environment. This was reflected in a positive
   relationship between body size and 1) prey richness, 2) number of basal
   energy sources (i.e. plants, detritus, phytoplankton and terrestrial
   prey), and 3) evenness in prey use. IBM results showed that changes in
   trophic structure with body size are well explained by gape limitation,
   but not by size preferences. Our results suggest that the fulfilment of
   the greater energetic demands of larger organism will depend on
   community diversity, which typically increases with ecosystem size,
   indicating a novel connection between area, diversity, body size, and
   food chain length.

TI Environmental modulation of reproductive activity of the invasive mussel
   Limnoperna fortunei: implications for antifouling strategies
SO AUSTRAL ECOLOGY
DT Article
AB Limnoperna fortunei (Dunker, 1857) (Bivalvia) invaded Argentina through
   the Rio de la Plata estuary around 1990 and is presently established
   throughout five South American countries as a dominant component of the
   benthic fauna and a major nuisance for industry and power plants.
   Between 1997 and 2006 we monitored the reproductive activity of L.
   fortunei through weekly measurements of planktonic larvae in six South
   American water bodies: Rio de la Plata estuary, Parana and Carapachay
   rivers, Salto Grande, ItaipU and Embalse de Rio Tercero reservoirs. Mean
   larval densities varied between 4000 and 7000 individuals m-3; except in
   the reservoirs of ItaipU (450 ind. m-3) and Salto Grande (869 ind. m-3),
   where the mussel was first recorded shortly before our surveys, and
   upstream dispersal is limited (Salto Grande). In all cases, reproductive
   output decreases during the winter. At four of the six sites surveyed
   larval densities were comparatively high for 8.8-10.2 months per year. A
   lower food supply is possibly responsible for the shorter reproductive
   period of 5.9 months at Embalse. At Salto Grande, there is a
   well-defined mid-summer drop in larval numbers, coinciding with blooms
   of cyanobacteria. We propose that, in addition to temperature, two major
   factors may regulate the reproductive activity of L. fortunei: (i) the
   availability of food; and (ii) blooms of toxic cyanobacteria,
   significantly shortening the otherwise very long reproductive period.
   This information is important for the design of antifouling programmes
   involving the use of molluscicides, and has potential for reduced
   biocide use. These results provide supporting evidence for some
   fundamental ecological theories of invasions discussed here.

TI Geographic variations of seasonality and coexistence in communities: The
   role of diversity and climate
SO AUSTRAL ECOLOGY
DT Article
AB One of the most conspicuous and widely analyzed patterns in ecology is
   the latitudinal gradient in species richness. Over the 200 years since
   its recognition, several hypotheses have accumulated in order to account
   for spatial variations in diversity. Geographic variations in
   seasonality have been repeatedly proposed as a determinant of community
   richness. However, the geographic structure of community seasonality has
   not yet been analyzed. In the present work we evaluated three hypotheses
   that account for variations in the temporal structuring of communities:
   first, environmental seasonality determines community seasonality;
   second, community richness determines its degree of structuring; and
   third, the presence of an increase in species segregation with latitude,
   reflected in a pattern of species negative co-occurrence. The hypotheses
   were evaluated using path analysis on 29 amphibian communities from
   South America, connecting latitude, environmental conditions, diversity,
   seasonality, and coexistence structure - nestedness and negative
   co-occurrence - within communities. Latitude positively affects
   community seasonality through an increase in temperature seasonality,
   but a weak negative direct effect suggests that other variables not
   considered in the model - such as the strength of biotic interactions -
   could also be involved. Both latitude and diversity (directly and
   indirectly) determine an increase in negative co-occurrence and
   nestedness. This suggests that groups of species that are mutually
   nested in time are internally segregated. Further, the strength of this
   structure is determined by community diversity and latitude. Temporal
   structuring of a community is associated with latitude and diversity,
   pointing to the existence of a systematic change in community
   organization far beyond, but probably interrelated, with the recognized
   latitudinal trend in richness. The available information and analysis
   supported the three hypotheses evaluated.

TI Female cooperation in plug formation in a spider: effects of male
   copulatory courtship
SO BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY
DT Article
AB One of the strongest indications that cryptic female choice is an
   evolutionary phenomenon of general importance is the widespread
   existence of male courtship behavior during copulation. It has been
   presumed that such copulatory courtship functions to induce female
   reproductive behavior that favors the male's reproductive interests, but
   this function has seldom been demonstrated. Here, we examine the
   possible effects of male copulatory courtship in the spider Leucauge
   mariana (Tetragnathidae) on whether a female will aid the male in
   forming a copulatory plug, thus reducing the chances that future mates
   will be able to inseminate her. Greater numbers of 2 behavior patterns
   by the male during copulation, rhythmic pushing on the female's legs
   with his front legs, and repeated short insertions with his genitalia
   were associated with increased chances that the female would cooperate
   in plug formation. This confirms that these behavior patterns do indeed
   function as courtship.

TI Effects of Submerged Vegetation on Water Clarity Across Climates
RID D-7550-2011
RID F-2681-2011
SO ECOSYSTEMS
DT Article
AB A positive feedback between submerged vegetation and water clarity forms
   the backbone of the alternative state theory in shallow lakes. The water
   clearing effect of aquatic vegetation may be caused by different
   physical, chemical, and biological mechanisms and has been studied
   mainly in temperate lakes. Recent work suggests differences in biotic
   interactions between (sub)tropical and cooler lakes might result in a
   less pronounced clearing effect in the (sub)tropics. To assess whether
   the effect of submerged vegetation changes with climate, we sampled 83
   lakes over a gradient ranging from the tundra to the tropics in South
   America. Judged from a comparison of water clarity inside and outside
   vegetation beds, the vegetation appeared to have a similar positive
   effect on the water clarity across all climatic regions studied.
   However, the local clearing effect of vegetation decreased steeply with
   the contribution of humic substances to the underwater light
   attenuation. Looking at turbidity on a whole-lake scale, results were
   more difficult to interpret. Although lakes with abundant vegetation (>
   30%) were generally clear, sparsely vegetated lakes differed widely in
   clarity. Overall, the effect of vegetation on water clarity in our lakes
   appears to be smaller than that found in various Northern hemisphere
   studies. This might be explained by differences in fish communities and
   their relation to vegetation. For instance, unlike in Northern
   hemisphere studies, we find no clear relation between vegetation
   coverage and fish abundance or their diet preference. High densities of
   omnivorous fish and coinciding low grazing pressures on phytoplankton in
   the (sub)tropics may, furthermore, weaken the effect of vegetation on
   water clarity.

TI Lake and watershed characteristics rather than climate influence
   nutrient limitation in shallow lakes
RID D-7550-2011
SO ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
DT Article
AB Both nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) can limit primary production in
   shallow lakes, but it is still debated how the importance of N and P
   varies in time and space. We sampled 83 shallow lakes along a
   latitudinal gradient (5 degrees-55 degrees S) in South America and
   assessed the potential nutrient limitation using different methods
   including nutrient ratios in sediment, water, and seston, dissolved
   nutrient concentrations, and occurrence of N-fixing cyanobacteria. We
   found that local characteristics such as soil type and associated land
   use in the catchment, hydrology, and also the presence of abundant
   submerged macrophyte growth influenced N and P limitation. We found
   neither a consistent variation in nutrient limitation nor indications
   for a steady change in denitrification along the latitudinal gradient.
   Contrary to findings in other regions, we did not find a relationship
   between the occurrence of (N-fixing and non-N-fixing) cyanobacteria and
   the TN:TP ratio. We found N-fixing cyanobacteria (those with
   heterocysts) exclusively in lakes with dissolved inorganic nitrogen
   (DIN) concentrations of <100 mu g/L, but notably they were also often
   absent in lakes with low DIN concentrations. We argue that local factors
   such as land use and hydrology have a stronger influence on which
   nutrient is limiting than climate. Furthermore, our data show that in a
   wide range of climates N limitation does not necessarily lead to
   cyanobacterial dominance.

TI Climate-related differences in the dominance of submerged macrophytes in
   shallow lakes
RID D-7550-2011
RID F-2681-2011
SO GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
DT Article
AB It has been suggested that shallow lakes in warm climates have a higher
   probability of being turbid, rather than macrophyte dominated, compared
   with lakes in cooler climates, but little field evidence exists to
   evaluate this hypothesis. We analyzed data from 782 lake years in
   different climate zones in North America, South America, and Europe. We
   tested if systematic differences exist in the relationship between the
   abundance of submerged macrophytes and environmental factors such as
   lake depth and nutrient levels. In the pooled dataset the proportion of
   lakes with substantial submerged macrophyte coverage (> 30% of the lake
   area) decreased in a sigmoidal way with increasing total phosphorus (TP)
   concentration, falling most steeply between 0.05 and 0.2 mg L(-1).
   Substantial submerged macrophyte coverage was also rare in lakes with
   total nitrogen (TN) concentrations above 1-2 mg L(-1), except for lakes
   with very low TP concentrations where macrophytes remain abundant until
   higher TN concentrations. The deviance reduction of logistic regression
   models predicting macrophyte coverage from nutrients and water depth was
   generally low, and notably lowest in tropical and subtropical regions
   (Brazil, Uruguay, and Florida), suggesting that macrophyte coverage was
   strongly influenced by other factors. The maximum TP concentration
   allowing substantial submerged macrophyte coverage was clearly higher in
   cold regions with more frost days. This is in agreement with other
   studies which found a large influence of ice cover duration on shallow
   lakes' ecology through partial fish kills that may improve light
   conditions for submerged macrophytes by cascading effects on periphyton
   and phytoplankton. Our findings suggest that, in regions where climatic
   warming is projected to lead to fewer frost days, macrophyte cover will
   decrease unless the nutrient levels are lowered.

TI Connectivity and patch area in a coastal marine landscape: Disentangling
   their influence on local species richness and composition
SO AUSTRAL ECOLOGY
DT Article
AB Landscape ecology emerged as a terrestrial discipline to evaluate the
   effect of spatial configuration of natural systems on ecological
   patterns. The advances in marine systems have been comparatively scarce
   perhaps as a consequence of a long-standing view about the greater
   dispersal potential of marine species and its effect on the spatial
   homogenization of marine landscapes. Herein we used an intertidal rocky
   system as a model to analyse the effect of landscape attributes on local
   species richness and composition. We evaluated the effect of patch area,
   landscape connectivity and salinity gradient on local species richness
   of macro-invertebrates, and the effect of geographic distance on species
   similarity. We sampled 19 rocky patches along the Uruguayan Atlantic
   coast one time during the spring of 2003. The relative contribution of
   the variables assessed on specific richness of sessile, mobile and total
   macrofauna was analysed with a stepwise multiple linear regression. For
   the mobile macrofaunal richness, we also incorporated the sessile
   macrofaunal richness as another independent variable. The effect of
   geographic distance on biological similarity was assessed by a Mantel
   test. We showed that landscape connectivity, as a descriptor of the
   average physical isolation of a biological community in the landscape,
   is an important factor explaining the community species richness for
   sessile macrofauna, what indirectly increases the mobile macrofaunal
   richness. The geographic distance between sites was negatively related
   to species similarity. We suggest that at the landscape scale,
   connectivity among sites can be important to understand the local
   structure of marine communities, particularly in rocky intertidal
   systems. Also the distance-decay of similarity in community composition
   provides a useful descriptor of how biological composition varies along
   a physical gradient. Our results contribute to reinforce the view that
   mesoscale connectivity (10(1-2) km) in coastal marine landscapes plays a
   more important role in local community structure than previously
   assumed.

TI Explaining patterns of primary production from individual level traits
SO JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE
DT Article
AB Question
   Do species traits explain differences in productivity in grazed and
   ungrazed plots?
   Location
   Rio de la Plata grasslands, Uruguay (31 degrees 54'S, 58 degrees 15'W).
   Methods
   In a greenhouse experiment, we measured the relative growth rate (RGR)
   of grasses with contrasting responses to grazing (increasers and
   decreasers). We performed six harvests at weekly intervals in order to
   calculate the RGR and assess 12 plant traits. We compared the RGR
   between increaser and decreaser species after 2 and 5 weeks using
   t-tests. Linear and potential regression models were fitted to time
   versus natural logarithm of total dry biomass relationships. The RGR
   temporal trajectories of increaser and decreaser species were obtained
   from the derivatives of the best-fit functions. Principal component
   analysis (PCA) was used to sort species according to their traits.
   Results
   The RGR of decreaser grasses was higher than that of increasers at the
   second week, while at the fifth week the opposite was observed. The RGR
   of decreasers dropped through time, while the RGR of increaser species
   was constant. The PCA separated increaser from decreaser species. The
   attributes related to increaser species were: high specific leaf area,
   tillering rate, green leaf rate, total leaf number, root weight ratio
   and leaf weight ratio; while those associated with decreaser species
   were: high dead biomass, senescence rate, reproductive biomass, leaf
   elongation rate and total biomass.
   Conclusions
   Traits possessed by decreasers reduce light availability and increase
   the reproductive investment, explaining the drop in RGR. Specific
   differences in RGR seem to scale up to the ecosystem level and would
   explain the pattern in aboveground net primary production observed in
   the field under contrasting grazing regimes.

TI Hydrology-Driven Regime Shifts in a Shallow Tropical Lake
SO ECOSYSTEMS
DT Article
AB Shifts between alternative stable states have become a focus of research
   in temperate shallow lakes. Here we show that sharp transitions between
   a clear, macrophyte-dominated state and a turbid state without submerged
   plants can also occur in tropical floodplain lakes, albeit driven by a
   largely different set of mechanisms. We show how a shallow lake in the
   Pantanal becomes covered by an exploding population of the submerged
   macrophyte Egeria najas Planchon as the water level rises during the
   annual high-water period. Water clarity increases spectacularly in this
   period due to flushing with river water that has lost most of its
   suspended matter during its slow flow over the flooded vegetated plains.
   A few months later when the water level drops again, the submerged plant
   beds die and decompose rapidly, triggering a phase of increasing
   turbidity. During this period an increase in dissolved organic matter,
   suspended matter, and phytoplankton biomass results in a sharp
   deterioration in water clarity. The concomitant water level decrease
   largely counteracts the effects on the underwater light climate, so that
   the amount of light at the bottom may not differ in comparison with the
   high-water period. Therefore, changes in light climate seem unlikely to
   be the sole driver of the vegetation shifts, and other mechanisms may
   prevent recovery of the submerged vegetation until the next high-water
   episode. Also, contrary to what is found in temperate lakes, there is no
   evidence for top-down control of phytoplankton biomass associated with
   the macrophyte-dominated state in our tropical lake.

TI A network analysis of plant-pollinator interactions in temperate rain
   forests of Chiloe Island, Chile
RID B-7732-2009
SO OECOLOGIA
DT Article
AB This study characterizes the structure of a plant-pollinator network in
   a temperate rain forest of Chilo, Island, southern Chile, where woody
   species are strongly dependent on biotic pollinators, and analyzes its
   robustness to the loss of participating species. Degree distribution,
   nestedness, and expected species persistence were evaluated. In
   addition, we assessed the roles of predefined subsets of plants
   (classified by life forms) and pollinators (grouped by taxonomic orders)
   in the network's structure and dynamics. For this, we simulated the
   complete removal of each plant and pollinator subset and analyzed the
   resultant connectivity patterns, as well as the expected long-term
   species losses by running a stochastic model. Finally, we evaluated the
   sensitivity of the network structure to the loss of single species in
   order to identify potential targets for conservation. Our results show
   that the plant-pollinator network of this Chilean temperate rain forest
   exhibits a nested structure of interactions, with a degree distribution
   best described by a power law model. Model simulations revealed the
   importance of trees and hymenopterans as pivotal groups that maintain
   the core structure of the pollination network and guarantee overall
   species persistence. The hymenopterans Bombus dahlbomii and Diphaglossa
   gayi, the shrubs Tepualia stipularis and Ugni molinae, the vines
   Mitraria coccinea and Asteranthera ovata, and the entire set of tree
   species exerted a disproportionately large influence on the preservation
   of network structure and should be considered as focal species for
   conservation programs given current threats from selective logging and
   habitat loss.

TI Nutrient export and harvest residue decomposition patterns of a
   Eucalyptus dunnii Maiden plantation in temperate climate of Uruguay
SO FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
DT Article
AB The potential export of nutrients from Eucalyptus plantations harvested
   for pulp production may be high. However, depending on the harvest
   method, the nutrients from the residue can be recycled. The aims of this
   study were (i) to quantify the content and distribution of nutrients in
   different residue components at harvest for a Eucalyptus dunnii Maiden
   plantation; and (ii) to quantify the decomposition rates of the harvest
   residues, and the return of nutrients to the soil in the temperate
   climate conditions of Uruguay. Six trees of a 9-year-old E dunnii
   plantation with average diameter at breast-height (DBH) were harvested,
   and the biomass produced and the N, P, K, Ca and Mg contents in
   commercial and non-commercial logs, leaves, branches, bark and litter
   were estimated. Decomposition of the remains of leaves, branches,
   non-commercial logs, bark and litter was studied in the field for 2
   years. Although commercial logs accounted for 61% of the biomass
   produced, only 27% of the N, 35% of the P, 18% of the K, 16% of the Ca
   and 41% of the Mg present in the forest were exported with the product.
   When logs are exported without de-barking in the site, the nutrient
   export would increase to 41%, 55%. 46%, 68% and 66% of the total
   extraction of N, P, K, Ca and Mg, respectively. Residue decomposition
   showed that the leaves lost the highest proportion of biomass (half life
   0.86 years), and bark was most resistant to decomposition in the field
   (half life 5.36 years). As regards the nutrients, K was lost most
   rapidly and Ca showed the slowest loss, while N, P and Mg losses were
   generally more gradual, and proportional to the decomposition rate. (C)

TI Small-scale spatial dynamics of vegetation in a grazed Uruguayan
   grassland
SO AUSTRAL ECOLOGY
DT Article
AB We explored the small-scale plant species mobility in a subhumid native
   grassland subjected to grazing by cattle in south-western Uruguay. We
   established four permanent plots of 40 x 40 cm, divided in 16 x 16
   cells. In each cell, the presence of species was seasonally recorded for
   2 years and annually recorded for 4 years. By nesting the cells, we
   studied the mobility at different scales, from 6.25 cm(2) to 400 cm(2).
   At each scale we measured species richness, cumulative richness and the
   turnover rates of the dominant species. We found that the cumulative
   species richness was an increasing power function, with higher
   accumulation rates with smaller spatial scale. Although species richness
   showed seasonal fluctuations, the mean species richness was constant
   during the study period. We detected significant spatio-temporal
   variability in mobility patterns among species. Certain species showed a
   high capacity to colonize new sites, whereas other species rotate among
   sites that they previously occupied. Grazed communities in Uruguayan
   Campos are structured as a dense matrix of perennials grasses and forbs,
   where vegetative propagation is the main form of growth of the species.
   The small-scale dynamics and the high variability in the mobility
   characteristics could be linked with the diversity of growth forms and
   spatial strategies of the species in this community. We believe that a
   high degree of small-scale spatial dynamics contribute to explain the
   species coexistence and the apparent stability of communities at local
   scales.

TI To feed or to wrap? Female silk cues elicit male nuptial gift
   construction in a semiaquatic trechaleid spider
SO JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY
DT Article
AB By wrapping prey and offering it as a nuptial gift, males can obtain
   mating and/or parental benefits despite some costs. Males of the
   Neotropical semiaquatic spider Paratrechalea ornata (Trechaleidae) offer
   females a nuptial gift consisting of a prey item wrapped in silk. What
   stimulus inhibits males from feeding and elicits gift construction? We
   hypothesized that signals associated with female silk threads could
   affect decision-making by males. We investigated three groups of males
   carrying a captured prey under different experimental treatments. In the
   treatment S, males were exposed to an arena with female silk; in SF,
   males were exposed to both silk and a female confined in a cell, and in
   the control group, males were exposed to a clean arena. Gift
   construction was observed only in the S and SF groups, with a similar
   occurrence rate. After touching females (SF group), males did not change
   their pattern of gift construction. Gift construction occurrence
   increased with male and female age. The results lead us to assume that
   the existence of chemical cues associated with female silk elicits male
   searching behaviour and gift construction, allowing males to decide
   between eating or wrapping prey according to the possibility of a sexual
   encounter. Anticipating gift construction, males are ready to mate,
   diminishing the risks of predation, female desertion or male-male
   scramble competition. The effect of age on behavioural variation and the
   rate of construction is discussed.

TI Testing the Habitat Safety Hypothesis with behavioural field
   experiments: amphipod orientation on sandy beaches with contrasting
   morphodynamics
SO MARINE ECOLOGY-PROGRESS SERIES
DT Article
AB Understanding behavioural adaptations in sandy beach macrofauna has been
   a major step in theoretical development of sandy beach ecology. In
   particular, behavioural studies in supralittoral amphipods have been
   useful in understanding macrofaunal responses and adaptations to
   environmental changes in these dynamic ecosystems. The predictions of
   the Habitat Safety Hypothesis (HSH) were tested for the first time on
   Atlantorchestoidea brasiliensis through orientation experiments carried
   out on 2 sandy beaches, one dissipative and the other reflective.
   Orientation patterns of A. brasiliensis followed the trend predicted by
   the HSH: even though sandhoppers oriented seawards on both beaches using
   a sun compass, the orientation on the reflective beach was more precise
   than on the dissipative one. Thus, stability conditions in the
   supralittoral zone of the reflective beach favoured a higher precision
   of the sun compass. The precision of seawards orientation on the
   dissipative beach increased when landscape references were added to the
   sun compass mechanism. The response to an unexpected object was also
   experimentally tested by use of a visual pattern, and a higher
   individual variability in the orientation of the reflective beach
   population was found. Thus, orientation strategies in sandy beach
   environments seem to respond to the stability of the supralittoral zone,
   widening the general pattern predicted by the HSH for the supralittoral
   fauna to the behavioural traits of the population.

TI Sharp accumulation of heavy metals after weaning in the South American
   fur seal Arctocephalus australis
SO MARINE ECOLOGY-PROGRESS SERIES
DT Article
AB In marine mammals, the transition period between lactation and
   independent feeding provides an opportunity to evaluate the influence of
   the first solid food on heavy metal concentrations in their tissues at
   early stages of their life cycle. The aim of the present study was to
   compare mercury, cadmium, zinc and copper levels in lactating and
   recently weaned South American fur seal Arctocephalus australis pups
   from Uruguay and northern Argentina, in order to evaluate the heavy
   metal intake through solid food shortly after weaning. Heavy metal
   concentrations in liver, muscle and kidney were determined by atomic
   absorption spectroscopy. Mercury levels in suckling pups reached up to
   0.60 and 0.40 mu g g(-1) wet weight in liver and kidney tissues,
   respectively. This group presented lower levels of cadmium, with maximum
   concentrations of 0.11 mu g g(-1) and 0.17 mu g g(-1) in liver and
   kidney tissues, respectively. Weaned pups showed significantly higher
   levels of both cadmium (liver=6.93 +/- 4.73 mu g g(-1); kidney=20.89 +/-
   5.00 mu g g(-1)) and mercury (liver=3.91 +/- 16 mu g g(-1), kidney=0.57
   +/- 0.15 mu g g(-1)). These significantly higher levels, and a clear
   distributional pattern between organs, strongly suggest a rapid intake
   of heavy metals during the first months after weaning. The presence of
   mercury and cadmium in weaned pups also indicates relevant early
   predation on fish and squid, representing a considerable contribution of
   both metals, but mainly cadmium, for South American fur seal pups. This
   sharp accumulation could be used as an indicator of the weaning process.
   Furthermore, heavy metal levels of pups would constitute a relevant
   baseline level in the early life of the South American fur seal.

TI Bullfrog (Lithobates catesbeianus) invasion in Uruguay
SO BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS
DT Article
AB This is the first report of North American bullfrogs, Lithobates
   catesbeianus (=Rana catesbeiana), invasion in Uruguay. This Anura was
   introduced for farming proposes in 1987, but at present most of the
   farms are closed. At one of these closed farms, located at Rincon de
   Pando, Canelones, we report the occurrence of a feral population of L.
   catesbeianus. This invasion point is at an early stage and restricted to
   one or two ponds. We also report the effects of L. catesbeianus invasion
   in the community structure. This includes species composition and
   species size structure. In this system bullfrog tadpoles constitute a
   very important proportion of the present biomass. Bullfrog tadpoles
   appear to be displacing native amphibians and having some type of
   positive interaction with fishes. At the invaded system we found more
   fish species and larger sizes of the shared fish species. We analyze the
   involved risks of this invasion, the ecological impact by predation, the
   competition and habitat modification, and the potential of bullfrog to
   act as pathogens vector. We also recommend taking measures in order to
   avoid the expansion of this population. There is also the need of
   studies to search for new invasion points in Uruguay, especially where
   bullfrog farms were located.

TI Where do Swainson's hawks winter? Satellite images used to identify
   potential habitat
RID C-2735-2008
SO DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS
DT Article
AB During recent years, predictive modelling techniques have been
   increasingly used to identify regional patterns of species spatial
   occurrence, to explore species-habitat relationships and to aid in
   biodiversity conservation. In the case of birds, predictive modelling
   has been mainly applied to the study of species with little variable
   interannual patterns of spatial occurrence (e.g. year-round resident
   species or migratory species in their breeding grounds showing
   territorial behaviour). We used predictive models to analyse the factors
   that determine broad-scale patterns of occurrence and abundance of
   wintering Swainson's hawks (Buteo swainsoni). This species has been the
   focus of field monitoring in its wintering ground in Argentina due to
   massive pesticide poisoning of thousands of individuals during the
   1990s, but its unpredictable pattern of spatial distribution and the
   uncertainty about the current wintering area occupied by hawks led to
   discontinuing such field monitoring. Data on the presence and abundance
   of hawks were recorded in 30 x 30 km squares (n = 115) surveyed during
   three austral summers (2001-03). Sixteen land-use/land-cover,
   topography, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) variables
   were used as predictors to build generalized additive models (GAMs).
   Both occurrence and abundance models showed a good predictive ability.
   Land use, altitude, and NDVI during spring previous to the arrival of
   hawks to wintering areas were good predictors of the distribution of
   Swainson's hawks in the Argentine pampas, but only land use and NDVI
   were entered into the model of abundance of the species in the region.
   The predictive cartography developed from the models allowed us to
   identify the current wintering area of Swainson's hawks in the Argentine
   pampas. The highest occurrence probability and relative abundances for
   the species were predicted for a broad area of south-eastern pampas that
   has been overlooked so far and where neither field research nor
   conservation efforts aiming to prevent massive mortalities has been
   established.

TI Correlated evolution of fig size and color supports the dispersal
   syndromes hypothesis
RID C-2290-2009
SO OECOLOGIA
DT Article
AB The influence of seed dispersers on the evolution of fruit traits
   remains controversial, largely because most studies have failed to
   account for phylogeny and or have focused on conservative taxonomic
   levels. Under the hypothesis that fruit traits have evolved in response
   to different sets of selective pressures by disparate types of seed
   dispersers (the dispersal syndromes hypothesis), we test for two
   dispersal syndromes, defined as groups of fruit traits that appear
   together more often than expected by chance. (1) Bird syndrome fruits
   are brightly colored and small, because birds have acute color vision,
   and commonly swallow fruits whole. (2) Mammal syndrome fruits are
   dull-colored and larger on average than bird syndrome fruits, because
   mammals do not rely heavily on visual cues for finding fruits, and can
   eat fruits piecemeal. If, instead, phylogenetic inertia determines the
   co-occurrence of fruit size and color, we will observe that specific
   combinations of size and color evolved in a small number of ancestral
   species. We performed a comparative analysis of fruit traits for 64
   species of Ficus (Moraceae), based on a phylogeny we constructed using
   nuclear ribosomal DNA. Using a concentrated changes test and assuming
   fruit color is an independent variable, we found that small-sized fruits
   evolve on branches with red and purple figs, as predicted by the
   dispersal syndromes hypothesis. When using diameter as the independent
   variable, results vary with the combination of algorithms used, which is
   discussed in detail. A likelihood ratio test confirms the pattern found
   with the concentrated changes test using color as the independent
   variable. These results support the dispersal syndromes hypothesis.

TI Can a 'wintering area effect' explain population status of Swainson's
   hawks? A stable isotope approach
SO DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS
DT Article
AB It has been suggested that declines in breeding populations of
   Swainson's hawks (Buteo swainsoni) in California, Oregon, and Nevada may
   be due to differential mortality of hawks on their wintering grounds.
   Although massive mortality incidents reported on the wintering grounds
   partially support this suggestion, there are no data showing
   differential use of wintering areas by breeding populations of
   Swainson's hawks. We used stable-hydrogen isotope analysis of feathers
   to determine whether large flocks of hawks wintering in Argentina
   consisted of a mixture of individuals from across the North American
   breeding range or consisted of individuals from discrete breeding
   populations. We found that flocks of wintering Swainson's hawks
   consisted of a mixture of individuals. The lack of connectivity between
   populations of breeding and wintering hawks suggests that high wintering
   mortality, either natural or human-induced, is unlikely to have direct
   consequences on a single breeding area in North America. The demographic
   effects of winter mortality should be 'diluted' across the entire
   breeding range of Swainson's hawks.

AB Parasitism is the most common consumer strategy among organisms, yet
   only recently has there been a call for the inclusion of infectious
   disease agents in food webs. The value of this effort hinges on whether
   parasites affect food-web properties. Increasing evidence suggests that
   parasites have the potential to uniquely alter food-web topology in
   terms of chain length, connectance and robustness. In addition,
   parasites might affect food-web stability, interaction strength and
   energy flow. Food-web structure also affects infectious disease dynamics
   because parasites depend on the ecological networks in which they live.
   Empirically, incorporating parasites into food webs is straightforward.
   We may start with existing food webs and add parasites as nodes, or we
   may try to build food webs around systems for which we already have a
   good understanding of infectious processes. In the future, perhaps
   researchers will add parasites while they construct food webs. Less
   clear is how food-web theory can accommodate parasites. This is a deep
   and central problem in theoretical biology and applied mathematics. For
   instance, is representing parasites with complex life cycles as a single
   node equivalent to representing other species with ontogenetic niche
   shifts as a single node? Can parasitism fit into fundamental frameworks
   such as the niche model? Can we integrate infectious disease models into
   the emerging field of dynamic food-web modelling? Future progress will
   benefit from interdisciplinary collaborations between ecologists and
   infectious disease biologists.

TI Distribution of megabenthic gastropods along environmental gradients:
   the mid-domain effect and beyond
SO MARINE ECOLOGY-PROGRESS SERIES
DT Article
AB We analysed the distribution patterns of megabenthic species of marine
   molluscs from the Uruguayan shelf in relation to 3 interacting
   gradients, namely depth, salinity and temperature of sea bottom waters.
   Our results were generated from a data set comprising the complete list
   of megabenthic gastropods (adult shell length > 50 mm; 22 species) from
   a study area that encompassed latitudes from 34 to 39 degrees south,
   between 4 and 800 m depth. Multiple regressions were used to evaluate
   the contribution of 3 classes of explanatory variables to gastropod
   richness at sampling points along the gradients: (1) geometric
   constraints on the distribution of species' tolerance ranges for
   environmental variables (the mid-domain effect, MDE), (2) the
   species-area effect driven by the spatial extent of scaled environmental
   variables, and (3) the environmental variables themselves. In addition,
   we explored multivariate explanations for the bathymetric pattern of
   gastropod species richness, incorporating depth-based area, temperature,
   salinity and geometric constraints as predictor variables. Examination
   of Moran's I for regression residuals confirmed that results were not
   biased by spatial autocorrelation. Overall, the environmental variables
   per se were the most important contributors to the observed patterns.
   However, a significant signature of the MDE was revealed, by the entry
   of geometric constraints into nearly all models. In contrast, the
   species-area effect was less important. These results suggest that: (1)
   MDE may operate in any kind of bounded gradient, (2) both stochastic and
   deterministic processes are responsible for the pattern observed, and
   (3) the relative contribution of the MDE to the patterns is dependent on
   the gradient considered and the way in which species richness is
   measured.

TI Food web of a SW Atlantic shallow coastal lagoon: spatial environmental
   variability does not impose substantial changes in the trophic structure
SO MARINE ECOLOGY-PROGRESS SERIES
DT Article
AB We performed a detailed analysis of the food web structure of Laguna de
   Rocha, a temporally open coastal lagoon in the Southwest Atlantic,
   characterised by spatial gradients in salinity, nutrient levels and
   trophic status. Carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes of main producers,
   invertebrate and vertebrate consumers, and stomach contents of
   ichthyofauna were analysed seasonally at freshwater (north) and
   marine-influenced (south) sites to determine whether environmental
   differences induced changes in food web structure. Contribution of
   primary and secondary food sources and trophic linkages were assessed
   with the multisource-partitioning model IsoSource and an index that
   quantifies the contribution of each organism as food for the ecosystem.
   Isotopic analyses were performed for 10 primary organic matter sources
   (OM), 13 invertebrates and 9 fish species. Suspended and sediment OM
   constituted the most important primary sources, while direct consumption
   of macrophytes and macroalgae was marginal. The small invertebrates
   Neomysis americana, Nephtys fluviatilis, Pseudodiaptomus richardii and
   an amphipod were the most important intermediate consumers at both sites
   (except F richardii, which was present only in the north). Top predators
   were the fish species Micropogonias furnieri, Paralichthys orbygnianus
   and Hoplias malabaricus, and the maximum estimated trophic level
   (between 3.4 and 4.8) varied seasonally, but not between sites. Fish
   stomach content analyses largely confirmed results from the IsoSource
   mixing model. Overall results indicated that, despite environmental
   differences between sites, the structure of the biological assemblages
   and general trophic patterns were similar at both sites.

TI Identifying environmental constraints at the edge of a species' range:
   scallop Psychrochlamys patagonica in the SW Atlantic Ocean
RID D-4026-2009
SO MARINE ECOLOGY-PROGRESS SERIES
DT Article
AB Recognizing the relationships between oceanographic variables and
   population descriptors has been a major step in understanding
   geographical range limits. In the present study, we investigate which
   oceanographic features are responsible for the decrease in fitness and
   consequent northern limit of the scallop Psychrochlamys patagonica
   distribution in Uruguayan waters of the SW Atlantic Ocean (SAO), based
   on information compiled from fishing and oceanographic surveys. P.
   patagonica showed clear population responses to physical variables,
   including 4 marked decrease in abundance, individual size and muscle
   weight towards the northern edge of the range. A generalized additive
   model (GAM) significantly explained 78.7% of the deviance in scallop
   abundance and retained all 4 descriptors in the model as significant,
   showing a decrease in abundance at lower latitudes with higher
   temperature and at lower values of chl a and water depth. The
   performance of GAMs was compared with that of the equivalent generalized
   linear models (GLMs) and it was concluded that the extended flexibility
   offered by GAMs resulted in better overall fits. Spatial variations in
   scallop abundance were accurately predicted by the GAM, including the 2
   peaks at latitudes 36 degrees 20'S and 36 degrees 50'S. These spatial
   variations were closely related to the shelf break front around the 100
   m isobath, where abundance was higher. The northern range limit of the
   species in the SAO may be caused by a sharp decrease in habitat quality,
   indicated by temperatures higher than 9 degrees C (above species
   tolerance limit) associated with the influence of the Subtropical Water.
   Whereas physiological tolerance to temperature appears to be an
   important mechanism driving the range boundary of P. patagonica, food
   availability (reflected by the highest concentrations in chl a) is a key
   explanatory factor of the spatial variations in scallop abundance.

TI Daring females, devoted males, and reversed sexual size dimorphism in
   the sand-dwelling spider Allocosa brasiliensis (Araneae, Lycosidae)
SO BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY
DT Article
AB Sexual selection theory predicts that a higher investment in offspring
   will turn females into the selective sex, while males will compete for
   accessing and courting them. However, there are exceptions to the rule.
   When males present a high reproductive investment, sex roles can reverse
   from typical patterns, turning males into the choosy sex, while females
   locate males and initiate courtship. In many spiders, males are smaller
   than females, wandering in search of sedentary females and maximizing
   the number of copulations. In the present study, we present findings on
   the sand-dwelling wolf spider, Allocosa brasiliensis, evidencing a
   reversal in typical courtship roles reported for the first time in
   spiders. Males were bigger than females. Females located males and
   initiated courtship. Copulation always occurred in male burrows and took
   place mainly in long burrows. Males donated their burrows to the females
   after copulation, closing the entrance before leaving with female
   cooperation from inside. Males would provide females with a secure place
   for ovipositing, being exposed to predation and diminishing their future
   mating possibilities until constructing a new burrow. The cost of
   vacating the burrow and losing the refuge in an unpredictable habitat,
   such as sand dunes, would explain the courtship roles reversal in this
   spider species. Results turn A. brasiliensis as a promising model for
   discussing the determinants of sex roles and the pressures that drive
   their evolution and maintenance.

TI Sandy beaches at the brink
SO DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS
DT Article
AB Sandy beaches line most of the world's oceans and are highly valued by
   society: more people use sandy beaches than any other type of shore.
   While the economic and social values of beaches are generally regarded
   as paramount, sandy shores also have special ecological features and
   contain a distinctive biodiversity that is generally not recognized.
   These unique ecosystems are facing escalating anthropogenic pressures,
   chiefly from rapacious coastal development, direct human uses - mainly
   associated with recreation - and rising sea levels. Beaches are
   increasingly becoming trapped in a 'coastal squeeze' between burgeoning
   human populations from the land and the effects of global climate change
   from the sea. Society's interventions (e.g. shoreline armouring, beach
   nourishment) to combat changes in beach environments, such as erosion
   and shoreline retreat, can result in severe ecological impacts and loss
   of biodiversity at local scales, but are predicted also to have
   cumulative large-scale consequences worldwide. Because of the scale of
   this problem, the continued existence of beaches as functional
   ecosystems is likely to depend on direct conservation efforts.
   Conservation, in turn, will have to increasingly draw on a consolidated
   body of ecological theory for these ecosystems. Although this body of
   theory has yet to be fully developed, we identify here a number of
   critical research directions that are required to progress coastal
   management and conservation of sandy beach ecosystems.

TI Can warm climate-related structure of littoral predator assemblies
   weaken the clear water state in shallow lakes?
SO GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
DT Article
AB Shallow lakes, the most abundant lake type in the world, are very
   sensitive to climatic changes. The structure and functioning of shallow
   lakes are greatly impacted by submerged plants, and these may be
   affected by climate warming in various, contrasting, ways.
   Following a space-for-time substitution approach, we aimed to analyse
   the role of aquatic (submerged and free-floating) plants in shallow
   lakes under warm climates. We introduced artificial submerged and
   free-floating plant beds in five comparable lakes located in the
   temperate zone (Denmark, 55-57 degrees N) and in the subtropical zone
   (Uruguay, 30-35 degrees S), with the aim to study the structure and
   dynamics of the main associated communities.
   Regardless of differences in environmental variables, such as area,
   water transparency and nutrient status, we found consistent patterns in
   littoral community dynamics and structure (i.e. densities and
   composition of fish, zooplankton, macroinvertebrates, and periphyton)
   within, but substantial differences between, the two regions.
   Subtropical fish communities within the macrophyte beds exhibited higher
   diversity, higher density, smaller size, lower relative abundance of
   potentially piscivores, and a preference for submerged plants, compared
   with otherwise similar temperate lakes. By contrast, macroinvertebrates
   and cladocerans had higher taxon richness and densities, and periphyton
   higher biomass, in the temperate lakes. Several indicators suggest that
   the fish predation pressure was much stronger among the plants in the
   subtropical lakes. The antipredator behaviour of cladocerans also
   differed significantly between climate zones. Submerged and
   free-floating plants exerted different effects on the spatial
   distribution of the main communities, the effects differing between the
   climate zones. In the temperate lakes, submerged plants promoted trophic
   interactions with potentially positive cascading effects on water
   transparency, in contrast to the free-floating plants, and in strong
   contrast to the findings in the subtropical lakes.
   The higher impact of fish may result in higher sensitivity of warm lakes
   to external changes (e.g. increase in nutrient loading or water level
   changes). The current process of warming, particularly in temperate
   lakes, may entail an increased sensitivity to eutrophication, and a
   threat to the high diversity, clear water state.

TI On the relationship between trophic position, body mass and temperature:
   reformulating the energy limitation hypothesis
RID B-7732-2009
SO OIKOS
DT Article
AB Understanding the factors that constrain and drive changes in food chain
   length represents an open challenge in ecology. Although several
   explanatory hypotheses have been proposed, no synthesis has yet been
   achieved. The role of body size has been well-studied in recent years
   because the hierarchy of trophic connections - in which large animals
   consume small ones - suggests a positive relationship between trophic
   position and body size. Empirical evidence, however, supports the
   existence of both positive and negative associations, and some studies
   have even reported no significant relationship between trophic position
   and body size. These results suggest that the relationship may be
   non-monotonic and driven by several interacting mechanisms. Here, we
   analyze the effects of energetic limitations and structural constraints
   on species' trophic positions. We show that the trophic position of
   small-bodied animals can be limited by their ability to consume large
   prey, whereas energetic limitations strongly constrain trophic positions
   for large-bodied animals, with the intensity of this constraint
   depending on the amount of energy available to top predators. These
   differences in limiting mechanisms can account for the observed
   variability in the association between the trophic position of top
   predators and size. Furthermore, our derivation makes use of the
   Metabolic theory of ecology and predicts a negative relationship between
   temperature and the maximum achievable food chain length, providing a
   mechanistic foundation for the observed reductions in food chain length
   with temperature.

TI Eastward Ho: phylogeographical perspectives on colonization of hosts and

RID D-8894-2011
SO JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY
DT Editorial Material
AB The response of Arctic organisms and their parasites to dramatic
   fluctuations in climate during the Pleistocene has direct implications
   for predicting the impact of current climate change in the North. An
   increasing number of phylogeographical studies in the Arctic have laid a
   framework for testing hypotheses concerning the impact of shifting
   environmental conditions on transcontinental movement. We review 35
   phylogeographical studies of trans-Beringian terrestrial and freshwater
   taxa, both hosts and parasites, to identify generalized patterns
   regarding the number, direction and timing of trans-continental
   colonizations. We found that colonization across Beringia was primarily
   from Asia to North America, with many events occurring in the Quaternary
   period. The 35 molecular studies of trans-Beringian organisms we
   examined focused primarily on the role of glacial cycles and refugia in
   promoting diversification. We address the value of establishing testable
   hypotheses related to high-latitude biogeography. We then discuss future
   prospects in Beringia related to coalescent theory, palaeoecology,
   ancient DNA and synthetic studies of arctic host-parasite assemblages
   highlighting their cryptic diversity, biogeography and response to
   climate variation.

TI Chloroplast DNA variation in the Turnera sidoides L. complex
   (Turneraceae): biogeographical implications
SO JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY
DT Article
AB Aim To analyse the current geographical structure of chloroplast DNA
   variation in the Turnera sidoides L. complex in order to establish
   historical biogeographical hypotheses for the mid-latitude South
   American lowlands. During the Quaternary, the climate shifted from
   tropical humid to cold dry, and the vegetation cover has not been
   stable. The consequences of these processes on the current distribution
   of the vegetation of this area have received very little attention.
   Location The mid-latitude South American lowlands extend between c. 20
   and 40 degrees S and include Uruguay, northern, central and eastern
   Argentina, southern Brazil, and parts of southern Paraguay and Bolivia.
   They are surrounded by higher-elevation systems.
   Methods Turnera sidoides is a well-studied polyploid complex of
   perennial rhizomatous herbs occurring throughout the area of interest.
   We analysed 321 individuals from 79 populations of the five recognized
   subspecies. We also included progenies from artificial crosses in order
   to analyse chloroplast inheritance. After screening sequences for four
   non-coding chloroplast DNA regions, the trnL-trnF spacer was selected to
   characterize the collection.
   Results Three haplotypes can be easily identified, with each differing
   from the others in two independent characters. A clear geographic
   structure is revealed when haplotypes are plotted for the complex as a
   whole regardless of subspecies and cytotype. Three distinct regions can
   be identified.
   Main Conclusions We propose three putative refugial areas for the
   Turnera sidoides complex, which are associated with the orographical
   systems of the region. Ravines and slopes in the Haedo Cuchilla system
   in northern Uruguay, the elevations of the western side of the area in
   Argentina, and the eastern Serranias system in south-eastern Uruguay may
   each have served as refugia in which the A, B and C haplotypes became
   fixed during the drier climatic phases. Biogeographical patterns in the
   area covered by T. sidoides, particularly east of the Uruguay River,

TI Female sexual receptivity after partial copulations in the wolf spider
   (Schizocosa malitiosa)
SO JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY
DT Article
AB Mated females of the wolf spider Schizocosa malitiosa are frequently
   refractory to further copulations. Copulation consists of two successive
   behavioural patterns: pattern I (PI) and pattern II (PII). During PI
   males make multiple consecutive insertions with each palp, and in PII
   males alternate the use of palps after each insertion until dismounting.
   As both patterns are inseminatory, another function - such as generating
   female reluctance - is suggested for this complex behaviour. Here we
   test experimentally whether female spiders mated only with PI, or only
   with PII, are reluctant to re-mate. Each copulating male was interrupted
   immediately after the end of PI (phase A), and the same male was
   instantly exposed to a second virgin female. After re-mounting, the male
   initially performed a brief recapitulation of PI followed by PII (both
   together considered as phase B). For testing female sexual reluctance,
   females were exposed to a second male 3 days after the partial mating,
   but whenever the mounting occurred it was interrupted. Females were
   raised and progeny was counted. Phase-A-mated females were more
   reluctant to re-mating than phase-B-mated females, but their respective
   progeny was similar. We suggest that female reluctance is caused by
   sperm-associated substances transferred during PI.

TI Settlement of shore crab Carcinus maenas on a mesotidal open habitat as
   a function of transport mechanisms
SO MARINE ECOLOGY-PROGRESS SERIES
DT Article
AB We evaluated the patterns of larval settlement of Carcinus maenas on
   natural substratum and its relationships with forcing factors related to
   larval transport mechanisms, Settlement was estimated as colonisation of
   traps containing defaunated substratum. Traps were deployed at low tide
   for 24 to 26 h, in the intertidal of the island of Helgoland (North Sea,
   German Bight), every day during the settlement seasons of 2003 to 2005.
   The forcing factors were wind direction, predicted residual surface (0
   to 8 m) currents, and days since spring tide. The settlement season
   lasted from the end of June to the end of August; colonisation rates
   varied among and within years, without a clear pattern. In 2003 and
   2004, long periods of low colonisation rates occurred in association
   with strong and persistent (5 to 10 d) SW winds and eastward currents.
   In 2003, colonisation peaked at spring tide only when winds were not
   from SW and currents were not flowing eastwards. In 2005, colonisation
   rates peaked mainly at, or 1 to 3 d after, spring tide; periods of low
   colonisation were short, except at the end of the settlement season.
   According to an existing 2-step model and to local movement of
   megalopae, colonisation patterns in the intertidal may reflect transport
   processes: (1) settlement rates on Helgoland are primarily affected by
   wind-driven currents: SW winds transport larvae out of Helgoland waters,
   leading to low settlement rates, while other wind regimes transport them
   towards Helgoland. In the absence of strong SW winds, peaks of
   settlement at or after spring tide suggest (2) selective tidal stream
   transport or some form of tidally mediated flow. The absence of SW winds
   leads to a higher influence of local movement of megalopae, as the
   number of larvae reaching the benthic habitat is high. In consequence,
   colonisation of natural substratum may reflect larval transport
   processes and local movement of larvae in C. maenas and other
   invertebrates with mobile benthic stages.

TI Age at maturity in cavies: Are precocial mammals different?
SO ECOSCIENCE
DT Article; Proceedings Paper
CT Symposium on Marsupials as Models for Research held at the 9th
   International Mammalogical Congress
CY AUG , 2005
CL Sapporo, JAPAN
AB In short-lived mammals, age at maturity is a particularly important
   parameter influencing lifetime fitness. Age at maturity proves highly
   variable in altricial rodents, but little is known for small precocial
   rodents of the order Caviomorpha. Even though extreme precociality
   implies early maturation, female cavies and guinea-pigs (genus Cavia)
   advance puberty considerably in the presence of males. We briefly review
   earlier findings and compare them to data from altricial rodents. We
   report experiments on 2 very similar species of cavy, the dark-backed
   (C. magna) and the wild cavy (C. aperea). In the dark-backed cavy, we
   tested whether the male signal responsible for acceleration of maturity
   is a chemical in urine, as demonstrated for mice. Females exposed twice
   daily to male urine on their nares matured at the same age (73-75 d) and
   mass (around 330 g, 4 times birth mass) as females treated with water.
   Thus, chemicals in urine did not replace the effect of male presence.
   Two experiments with wild cavies showed that male presence without
   physical contact was sufficient to accelerate puberty, even though
   physical interaction leads to even earlier maturation. Presence of a
   male during the first 10 d of life only did not lead to advanced
   maturation in young females. Functionally, it may be more correct to
   speak of a delay in the onset of maturity in the absence of males rather
   than considering male presence to stimulate early maturation.
   Comparative evidence suggests that precocial species generally mature
   earlier than altricials.

TI Past and current evidence of persecution of the Endangered crowned eagle
   Harpyhaliaetus coronatus: in Argentina
SO ORYX
DT Article
AB The crowned eagle Harpyhaliaetus coronatus is a large Neotropical eagle
   categorized as Endangered throughout its range. However, the threats to
   this species are poorly understood. We present data on the causes of
   death of crowned eagles in semi-arid forests of La Pampa province,
   central Argentina. Data was obtained from field surveys and from
   interviews with 62 local landowners during 1999-2004. Over this period
   five eagles were shot, one killed by a car, one was found dead in a
   cattle water trough, and one was found in captivity. From the interviews
   information was obtained about a further 10 cases of eagles being shot,
   disturbed or trapped. Five (13%) of 38 interviewed landowners who
   positively identified the species admitted having killed or disturbed
   eagles in the past but only two (5%) mentioned predation of eagles upon
   livestock as a problem. Persecution seems to be a significant threat to
   this species in central Argentina and future research and conservation
   action should be focused not only on gaining a better knowledge of the
   biology of the species but also on conservation and educational
   programmes involving local people.

TI Pelagic longlines: A threat to sea turtles in the Equatorial Eastern
   Atlantic
SO BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
DT Article
AB Pelagic longlines are widely known to interact with several species of
   sea turtles, and there is an increasing concern about the by-catch of
   turtles in commercial fisheries and its impact on their populations.
   However, information on sea turtle by-catch in the South Atlantic Ocean
   is scarce, and there are no quantitative by-catch data available on
   olive ridleys for the Equatorial Eastern Atlantic. In this paper we
   analyze data collected by observers on board an Uruguayan long-liner
   targeting swordfish in two areas in the Equatorial Eastern Atlantic: off
   the Gulf of Guinea and north of Saint Helenaa Island. Specimens of
   Lepidochelys oliuacea and Dermochelys cariacea were hooked or entangled
   in 26 longline sets. All registered interactions with olive ridleys took
   place off the The Gulf of Guinea, with captures ranging from 1 to 3
   specimens in a single set. The captured specimens, though not measured
   directly, appeared to be juveniles. In addition, the examination of the
   stomach contents of one female mako shark showed dermal scutes,
   vertebrae and the complete head of a sea turtle identified as L.
   olivacea, allowing us to estimate its curved carapace length. In
   contrast, adult specimens of D. coriacea were caught in the two fishing
   areas. The capture of 10 individuals in a single set was recorded. Due
   to the high rate of sea turtle by-catch observed off the The Gulf of
   Guinea (1.02 ind/1000 hooks) conservation programs in the area should
   take into consideration the possible existence of a developmental and
   feeding area in this zone. Accordingly, longline fisheries in this area
   should be monitored and mitigation measures put in place to avoid or
   minimize damage to the pelagic phase of African populations of sea
   turtles. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Ecosystem changes associated with grazing in subhumid South American
   grasslands
RID D-2743-2009
SO JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE
DT Article
AB Question: What are the changes in vegetation structure, soil attributes
   and mesofauna associated with grazing in mesic grasslands?
   Location: Southern Campos of the Rio de la Plata grasslands, in
   south-central Uruguay.
   Methods: We surveyed seven continuously grazed and ungrazed paired
   plots. Plant and litter cover were recorded on three 5-m interception
   lines placed parallel to the fence in each plot. We extracted soil fauna
   from a 10 ern deep composite sample and analysed the oribatids. Soil
   attributes included bulk density, water content, organic carbon (in
   particulate and mineral associated organic matter) and nitrogen content
   and root biomass at different depths. Changes in floristic, Plant
   Functional Types and mesofauna composition were analysed by Non-metric
   Multidimensional Scaling.
   Results: Species number was lower in ungrazed than in grazed plots. Of
   105 species in grazed plots only three were exotics. Shrub and litter
   cover were significantly higher inside the exclosures, while the cover
   of Cyperaceae-Juncaceae was lower. Grazing treatments differed
   significantly in plant and oribatid species composition. Grazing
   exclusion significantly reduced soil bulk density and increased soil
   water content. Carbon content in particulate organic matter was lower in
   the upper soil of ungrazed sites, but deeper in the profile, grazing
   exclosures had 8% more carbon in the mineral associated organic matter.
   Conclusions: Our results generally agree with previous studies but
   deviate from the results of previous analyses in (1) the increase of
   shrub cover in ungrazed sites; (2) the redistribution of the soil
   organic carbon in the profile and (3) the low invasibility of the
   prairies regardless of grazing regime.

TI Distribution of saltmarsh plant communities associated with
   environmental factors along a latitudinal gradient on the south-west
   Atlantic coast
SO JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY
DT Article
AB Aim To produce an inventory of south-west Atlantic saltmarshes (from
   latitude 31 degrees 48' S to 43 degrees 20' S) using remotely sensed
   images and field sampling; to quantify their total area; to describe the
   biogeographical variation of the main habitats characterized by dominant
   vascular plants, in relation to major environmental factors; to test the
   hypothesis of predominance of the reversal pattern in plant distribution
   (sedges and grasses dominate the lower, regularly inundated zones, while
   the upper zones are occupied by more halophytic species) previously
   described; and to compare these south-west Atlantic saltmarshes with
   others world-wide.
   Location South-western Atlantic saltmarshes
   Methods Field samples of dominant emergent plant species positioned by
   the global positioning system (GPS) were obtained from most coastal
   saltmarshes (14) between southern Brazil and northern Patagonia,
   Argentina. Landsat satellite images were obtained and coastal saltmarsh
   habitats were quantified by supervised classification, utilizing points
   gathered in the field.
   Results Three main plant species dominated the low and middle intertidal
   saltmarsh, Spartina alterniflora Loesel., Spartina densiflora Brong. and
   Sarcocornia perennis (P. Mill.) A.J. Scott. The total area of the
   studied coastal saltmarshes was 2133 km(2), comprising 380 km(2) of Sp.
   alterniflora marsh, 366 km(2) of Sp. densiflora marsh, 746 km(2) of Sar.
   perennis marsh and 641 km(2) of brackish marsh (dominated by Juncus
   acutus L., Juncus kraussii Hochst., Scirpus maritimus L., Scirpus
   americanus Pers. and Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin.). Cluster
   analysis showed three habitat types: saltmarshes dominated by (1) Sp.
   densiflora and brackish species,(2) Sp. alterniflora and Sar. perennis
   and (3) Sp.densiflora only. The analysis of abiotic variables showed
   significant differences between groups of habitats and coordinated
   gradients of the abiotic variables. The south-west Atlantic coast showed
   decreasing mean annual rainfall (1200 to 196 mm) and increasing mean
   tidal amplitude (< 0.5 to > 2.5 m) from latitude 31 degrees to 43
   degrees.
   Main conclusions South-west Atlantic saltmarshes are globally important
   by virtue of their total extent. Remote sensing showed that the reversal
   pattern in plant distribution is not widespread. Indeed, south-west
   Atlantic saltmarshes are better characterized by the presence of the
   halophytic genera Spartina and Sarcocornia. Our results support the
   interpretation that south-west Atlantic saltmarshes constitute a class
   of temperate type (sensu Adam, 1990) with transitional characteristics
   between Australasian-South African saltmarshes and west Atlantic
   saltmarshes.

TI How effective is the MERCOSUR's network of protected areas in

SO ORYX
DT Article
AB We evaluate the effectiveness of the MERCOSUR's network of protected
   areas in representing South America's ecoregions. The region contains
   1,219 non-overlapping protected areas covering nearly 2,000,000 km(2).
   Fifty percent of the reserves are < 100 km(2) and 75% < 1,000 km(2).
   Less than a half of the 75 ecoregions in the MERCOSUR have at least 10%
   of their area within protected areas, and only 13 when just reserves in
   IUCN categories I-IV are considered. In general, forests are better
   represented than other biomes. At the national level the network of
   protected areas in Uruguay is the least developed in the region, with
   those of Bolivia and Chile the most developed. For 10% of each ecoregion
   to be protected at least another 500,000 km(2) would have to be
   incorporated into the network. Such expansion would be more efficient if
   conservation priorities are identified using a regional approach. This
   is of particular relevance for the cost-efficient protection of the 20
   ecoregions that are shared by two or more countries. While only c. 20%
   of the ecoregions found in Brazil are shared with other countries, > 75%
   of the ecoregions in Bolivia, c. 70% in Argentina, > 60% in Chile, and
   all the ecoregions in Paraguay and Uruguay are shared with other
   countries. Overall, although it currently covers 14% of the region, the
   network of protected areas of the MERCOSUR still performs poorly in
   protecting its ecoregions.

TI Temperature-dependent development and somatic growth in two allopatric
   populations of Acartia clausi (Copepoda : Calanoida)
RID C-5134-2008
SO MARINE ECOLOGY-PROGRESS SERIES
DT Article
AB This study compares the effect of temperature on the post-embryonic
   development time and weight-specific growth rate in 2 populations of
   Acartia clausi from different biogeographic areas (northern and southern
   Europe). Development was followed from nauplius 1 to adult at 3
   temperatures (10, 15 and 18 degrees C) at saturating food conditions.
   The relationship between development time and temperature was
   established by fitting Belehradek's function. The northern population
   had a shorter generation time at all temperatures. At 10 degrees C, the
   development time was estimated to be 33.9 and 36.4 d decreasing to 16.3
   and 17.4 d at 18 degrees C for the northern and southern populations,
   respectively. Prosome length decreased with temperature, and the
   southern population had longer individuals at all temperatures. ANCOVA
   revealed a significant (p < 0.001) positive effect of temperature on the
   growth rates, and nauplii grew faster than copepodites (except at 18
   degrees C in the southern population and 20 degrees C in the northern
   population). Significant differences between populations were noted
   during larval growth, with nauplii from the north growing faster at high
   temperatures (18 degrees C). The results indicate that the 2 A. clausi
   allopatric populations subjected to different temperature regimes have
   different temperature responses, in particular at high temperatures.

RID A-7522-2009
SO MARINE ECOLOGY-PROGRESS SERIES
DT Article
AB We assessed metabolic balance, RNA content, and egg hatching success
   (EHS) in Acartia tonsa and A. clausi over a wide salinity range (2 to 33
   and 16 to 33, respectively). For A. tonsa, the energy partitioning
   between ingestion, production and respiration was relatively constant
   with small differences in gross growth efficiency (GGE) and cost of
   growth (CG). In contrast, A. clausi exhibited significantly reduced
   ingestion and GGE, and highly elevated CG at salinities <= 20. In both
   species, RNA levels mirrored egg production. EHS was generally high in
   both species, but decreased by 80% for A. clausi at 16. These results
   contribute to the understanding of distribution patterns of both species
   along salinity gradients. The observed responses would allow the
   dominance of A. tonsa at low salinities, although its higher energetic
   requirement and feeding activity subject it to stronger predation
   pressure than competing A. clausi.

TI Succession and collapse of macrozoobenthos in a subtropical hypertrophic
   lake under restoration (Lake Rodo, Uruguay)
SO AQUATIC ECOLOGY
DT Article
AB We studied the succession patterns of the benthic community following a
   whole-lake restoration experiment in a subtropical hypertrophic lake
   (Lake Rodo, 34 degrees 55' S 56 degrees 10' W, Montevideo, Uruguay). The
   restoration measures involved diversion of the main inlet and removal of
   upper 1-m sediment and biomanipulation of the fish community. Between
   January 1997 and November 1999, we sampled sediments seasonally to
   analyse changes in benthos in relation to other abiotic and biotic
   characteristics of the system. The benthic community of the lake was
   composed of three families and nine genera. The maximum density (646 ind
   m(-2)), as well as the maximum taxonomic richness (six), were observed 1
   month after the lake was refilled. Since 1998, the benthic abundance
   decreased considerably and continuously and a total absence of benthic
   organisms was registered by the end of the year. The low abundance of
   macroinvertebrates during 1997 could be explained by the food
   preferences of the dominant fish species, and the high fish biomass at
   the beginning of the biomanipulation process. However, the most relevant
   physico-chemical temporal patterns were the increase of organic matter
   and nutrients in the sediment and the fluctuations of oxygen and nitrate
   in the deepest layer of the water column. The disappearance of benthos
   was related to these temporal changes. These results stress the
   importance of the increase of organic matter for the changes in the
   physicochemical environment, and its importance in the benthic
   succession and possible collapse. We suggest that in hypertrophic lakes,
   the effects of organic matter enrichment in the sediment can be even
   more relevant than fish predation in shaping the zoobenthos.

TI Habitat use and social structure of an isolated population of guanacos
   (Lama guanicoe) in the Monte Desert, Argentina
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH
DT Article
AB We studied abundance, habitat use and social structure of an isolated
   population of guanacos in the Lihue Calel National Park in central
   Argentina, based on data from foot surveys during 1998-2000. Based on
   topography and vegetation characteristics we distinguished three types
   of habitat: hills, valleys and piedmonts, and lowlands. Three types of
   social groups were observed: solitary males, family groups and male
   groups. The guanacos used hills preferentially, followed by valley and
   piedmont. The guanacos avoided the lowlands where the vegetation is
   dense. Habitat selection, both on a coarse and a fine scale, could be
   explained by habitat quality and possibly also predator avoidance
   behaviour. Abundance of guanacos increased by 21% over the 3-year-study
   period. However, the specificity of habitat requirements of guanacos and
   the susceptibility of the study area to wildfires could cause guanacos
   to move into sub-optimal areas were they are more vulnerable to
   predation and human persecution.

TI A model for the relationship between the interaction pattern of
   ecosystems and their fate
SO ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
DT Article
AB The growth of isolated species can be described by simple laws but the
   fate of ecosystems, where several species interact, is difficult to
   predict. A crucial point seems to be the identification of regularities
   in the species interaction patterns that determine the fate of
   ecosystems. We approach this problem by using an ecosystem of three
   species whose populations are governed by generalized Lotka-Volterra
   differential equations. In our model, the species undergo both
   inter-specific and intra-specific interactions. The inter-specific
   interactions are positive, null or negative and are parameterized by
   interaction coefficients epsilon(ij) which take values: +1, 0 and -1,
   respectively. In these conditions, 138 different patterns of
   interactions (up to species re-labeling) are possible. Two extreme cases
   for the three intra-specific interactions (self-interactions) are
   considered: epsilon(ii) = -1 and epsilon(ii) = 0. We also define derived
   parameters, calculated from the interaction coefficients, which are
   relevant to determine the survival of species. Comparison of particular
   patterns shows that the relationship between interaction structure and
   survival can be subtle and, a priori, unexpected. For instance, we found
   that adding a negative interaction to a given pattern may be
   detrimental, indifferent or even beneficial. The same may happen when
   adding a positive interaction. To make a systematic study of the
   relationship between structure and fate, first, we perform a
   "microscopic" study based on the analysis of individual patterns. As a
   result, we obtained certain general rules or "theorems" concerning the
   extreme cases of coexistence and extinction of the three species.
   Second, in order to cover intermediate cases, where precise rules could
   not be found, we performed "statistical" studies. These provide the
   probability of survival and coexistence of species as a function of the
   values of the interaction derived parameters. Among other results, we
   found that reciprocal cyclic structures, of both positive and negative
   interactions, and evenly distributed sign balances of input interactions
   to the species appear to favor survival and coexistence. (c) 2004

TI Feeding and reproduction in a small calanoid copepod: Acartia clausi can
   compensate quality with quantity
SO MARINE ECOLOGY-PROGRESS SERIES
DT Article
AB We analyzed the feeding, egg production rate (EPR), and the egg hatching
   success (EHS) of resulting eggs of adult Acartia clausi subject to
   realistic food levels (100 mu g C l(-1)) of 7 algae. Feeding was maximum
   (ca. 20 ml ind.(-1) d(-1)) with Thalassiosira weissflogii and minimum
   (ca. 0 ml ind.(-1) d(-1)) with Dunaliella tertiolecta and Prymnesium
   parvum. EPR was highest with T weissflogii, Tetraselmis sp., Rhodomonas
   sp., and Ditylum brightwellii (21 to 26 eggs ind.(-1) d(-1)) and
   moderate with Prorocentrum minimum (15 eggs ind.(-1) d(-1)). EHS was
   highest in R minimum (84%), followed by Rhodomonas sp. (80%), D,
   brightwellii (60%), T weissflogii (52%) and Tetraselmis sp. (40%).
   Supplementary nutritional effects (higher EHS and gross growth
   efficiency) appeared when A. clausi fed on mixtures of algae with
   contrasting effects on EPR and EFIS (T weissflogii and P. minimum)
   offered as mixed suspensions, or alternating between unialgal
   suspensions on a 12:12 h basis. However, realized fecundity (RF) was
   fairly stable for most single and mixed diets (range 12.3 to 17.3
   nauplii female(-1) d(-1)), with the exception of Tetraselmis sp. (8.9
   nauplii female(-1) d(-1)). Such stable RF was attained by compensating
   low EFIS with enhanced feeding and EPR, and consequently lower
   population growth efficiency. That represents a strategy with a high
   cost in terms of metabolism and predation risk.

TI Morphodynamics and habitat safety in sandy beaches: life-history
   adaptations in a supralittoral amphipod
SO MARINE ECOLOGY-PROGRESS SERIES
DT Article
AB Understanding the relationships between beach morphodynamics and
   descriptors of macrofauna assemblages has been a major step in
   theoretical development in sandy beach ecology. However, the role of
   morphodynamics in shaping life-history traits is still uncertain. Here,
   we test the predictions of the habitat harshness hypothesis (HHH) on the
   life-history traits of the sandhopper Atlantorchestoidea brasiliensis,
   based on information compiled from 7 Uruguayan sandy beaches spanning a
   continuum from reflective to dissipative states, over a period of almost
   2 yr. A. brasiliensis showed clear population responses to physical
   variables in a trend opposite to that predicted by the HHH, including an
   increase in abundance (total, ovigerous females and juveniles) and
   individual sizes from dissipative to reflective beaches. A generalized
   additive model explained 46.1 % of the deviance in sandhopper abundance
   and retained all 4 physical descriptors in the model as significant.
   Sandhopper abundance increased with grain size and beach face slope, and
   decreased with low values of water content and compaction of the sand.
   Per capita rate of recruitment increased linearly with adult abundance,
   i.e. there was a positive density-dependent effect of adults on
   recruitment rates, which exponentially decreased from reflective to
   dissipative beaches. Only the proportion of ovigerous females increased
   towards the dissipative domain. We conclude that the HHH did not
   accurately predict spatio-temporal fluctuations in population features
   of A. brasiliensis, particularly because of a limited appreciation of
   the role played by life-history strategies in explaining population
   responses to the environment. Our results have important implications
   for sandy beach macrofauna, particularly supralittoral organisms, and
   suggest a novel hypothesis (termed here the 'hypothesis of habitat
   safety'), which states that the combination of narrow swashes and steep
   slopes makes reflective beaches a more stable and safer environment for
   supralittoral species.

TI Feeding ecology of dominant larval myctophids in an upwelling area of
   the Humboldt Current
RID A-4039-2008
SO MARINE ECOLOGY-PROGRESS SERIES
DT Article
AB The feeding of 2 sympatric larval myctophids, Diogenichthys laternatus
   and Triphoturus mexicanus aff. oculeus, was analyzed in an upwelling
   area off northern Chile (23 degrees S, 71 degrees W). Diel feeding
   period, feeding incidence, feeding selectivity and diet overlap was
   estimated under different environmental conditions: coastal and oceanic
   areas and 2 depth strata in summer and winter 1997. Analyses were based
   on larval stomach contents and microplankton abundance estimates. Larval
   tooth morphology and relationships between larval length, mouth width
   and prey size were explored. Both species fed on the most abundant
   microplankton layer during daylight, and both preferred copepods and
   nauplii, although the diet of D. laternatus was more diverse. As
   expected, the diets of these species tended to overlap in periods and
   areas where food was more abundant, but diets differed under conditions
   of low food availability. The 50 to 100 mm size range dominated the size
   spectrum. of ingested prey in both species. The smallest prey width was
   constant for the entire range of larval sizes. The largest prey width
   was variable both within and between species, and increased with larval
   size. Regression analyses of mouth size and body length showed a
   potential relationship in D laternatus and a linear relationship in T
   mexicanus aff. oculeus. Prey ingested by D. laternatus were wider than
   those ingested by T mexicanus all. oculeus at equal larval sizes. The
   species presented differences in dentition patterns (hook-like teeth and
   pharyngeal structures in D, laternatus, conical teeth in T mexicanus
   aff. oculeus). Opportunistic feeding and the feeding characteristics of
   both species should favor persistence and high abundances in the
   upwelling area of the Humboldt Current.

TI Effect of grazing on community structure and productivity of a Uruguayan
   grassland
SO PLANT ECOLOGY
DT Article
AB Grasslands and their grazers provide some of the most compelling
   examples for studying the relationship between diversity, productivity,
   and disturbance. In this study, we analyzed the impact of
   grazing-induced changes in species composition and community structure
   upon the productivity of a grassland in the Campos region, Uruguay. We
   compared three treatments: a continuously grazed area, a 9-year old
   exclosure to domestic herbivores, and grazing-simulated plots inside the
   exclosure, which were clipped so that their standing biomass resembled
   that of the grazed area. We studied the community composition of the
   grazed and ungrazed situations, and determined biomass and above-ground
   net primary production (ANPP) of the three treatments during 1 year.
   Grazed plots had higher species richness and diversity than the
   exclosure. Grazing resulted in the replacement of some cool-season,
   tussock grasses by warm-season, prostrate grasses. ANPP was 51% higher
   under grazing than in the exclosure, but the grazing-simulated plots
   inside the exclosure were the most productive treatment, 29% higher than
   the grazed plots. Thus, two components of grazing effect may be
   postulated for this grassland. The structural component resulted in
   higher ANPP, probably due to the elimination of standing dead biomass.
   The species composition component resulted in lower ANPP once the
   structural component was controlled, probably due to the shift to
   warm-season phenology and prostrate habit. Our findings contrast with a
   similar experiment carried out in the neighbouring Flooding Pampa
   region, which suggests that the relationship between grazing and
   community structure and function is difficult to generalize.

TI Intraguild predation: a widespread interaction related to species
   biology
RID B-7732-2009
SO ECOLOGY LETTERS
DT Article
AB Intraguild predation (IGP), defined as killing and eating among
   potential competitors, seems to be a ubiquitous interaction, differing
   from competition or predation. In the present study we assess the
   frequency of IGP among 763 potential intraguild prey and 599 potential
   intraguild predators. Our results indicate that IGP is common in nature,
   reaching frequencies between 58.4 and 86.7%. A null model suggests that
   IGP in different groups of predators and prey (i.e. carnivores,
   omnivores, herbivores, detritivores, or top and intermediate species)
   have different deviations from a chance expectation, indicating these
   attributes of species biology as main determinants of IGP persistence.
   We suggest that IGP satisfies two basic requirements to be considered as
   important to the trophic structuring of communities. First, its
   occurrence is not random, rather it is associated with well-defined
   attributes of species biology, and secondly, it is a widespread
   interaction.

TI Linking life history traits in successive phases of a complex life
   cycle: effects of larval biomass on early juvenile development in an
   estuarine crab, Chasmagnathus granulata
SO OIKOS
DT Article
AB In marine benthic invertebrates with complex life cycles, recruitment
   success, juvenile survival, and growth may be affected by variation in
   both maternal factors and environmental conditions prevailing during
   preceding embryonic or larval development. In an estuarine crab,
   Chasmagnathus granulata, previous investigations have shown that initial
   larval biomass is positively correlated with the biomass of recently
   extruded eggs, and it depends also on the salinity experienced during
   embryogenesis. Biomass at hatching has consequences for the subsequent
   larval development which, in this species, comprises two alternative
   developmental pathways with four or five zoeal instars (short or long
   pathway) and a megalopa. Larvae hatching with a lower than average
   biomass tend to develop through the long pathway and metamorphose to
   megalopae with higher biomass. In the present study, we show
   experimentally that the long pathway produces also significantly larger
   juveniles (crab size measured as carapace width, biomass as dry mass,
   carbon and nitrogen contents). Compared with juveniles originating from
   the short pathway, those from the long pathway showed in successive
   instars longer moulting cycles and larger carapace width, but lower size
   increments at ecdysis. In consequence, differences in size or biomass of
   long pathway vs short pathway crabs tended to disappear in later instars
   (after stage V). Furthermore, we tested in juveniles the tolerance of
   starvation at three salinities (5parts per thousand, 15parts per
   thousand, 32parts per thousand). Tolerance of starvation was
   significantly higher in juveniles originating from the long pathway,
   indicating higher energy reserves. While salinity played only a minor
   role for survival, it exerted significant effects on the time of
   moulting to the second juvenile instar, regardless of the preceding
   developmental pathway. The biomass of first juveniles obtained from the
   short pathway showed a significant positive correlation with the biomass
   of the freshly hatched zoea I, but not in those from the long pathway.
   In conclusion, the fitness of juvenile C. granulata is linked with
   previous developmental processes and environmental conditions during the
   embryonic and larval phase. Hence, a better understanding and prediction
   of the recruitment success of marine benthic invertebrates with a
   complex life cycle may require more comprehensive life-history
   investigations.

TI Latitudinal patterns in abundance and life-history traits of the mole
   crab Emerita brasiliensis on South American sandy beaches
SO DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS
DT Article
AB Demographic and life-history attributes of the mole crab Emerita
   brasiliensis were analysed along 2700 km of the Atlantic coast of South
   America, including sandy beaches at the southernmost limit (Uruguay) and
   at the core of its geographical range (Brazil). Population features
   varied markedly within this range and exhibited systematic geographical
   patterns of variation. Abundance significantly increased from temperate
   to subtropical beaches, and the same held true for the asymptotic weight
   of males. Conversely, length at maturity and asymptotic weight of
   females increased from subtropical to temperate beaches, being inversely
   related to sea water temperature. Macroecological patterns in abundance
   and body weight showed the first large-scale evidence of scaling of
   population density to body size for a sandy beach population. Mortality
   rates (both sexes) followed a nonlinear increase from low-density
   temperate beaches to high-density subtropical beaches. The effect of
   habitat quality and availability could explain discontinuities in the
   species distribution within its range, and also differential responses
   in life-history attributes at a local scale. Asymmetries and converse
   latitudinal trends between sexes suggest that there is not a single
   general factor determining large-scale patterns in life-history traits
   of this species. Our results reinforce the view that density-dependent
   and environmental factors operating together regulate sandy beach
   populations. The need to develop macroecological studies in sandy beach
   ecology is highlighted, as knowledge acquired from local to large
   spatial scales throws light on population structure and regulation
   mechanisms.

TI Marine community ecology: importance of trait-mediated effects
   propagating through complex life cycles
SO MARINE ECOLOGY-PROGRESS SERIES
DT Article
AB Present theory of marine community structure includes the effect of
   environmental factors that act upon larval survival on distribution and
   abundance of benthic adults, The theory assumes that pre-settlement
   environmental factors produce a direct effect at the population level,
   determining the abundance of individuals that enter the benthic habitat.
   These are density effects that propagate from the larval to the benthic
   phase (abbreviated here as DEMPHs). However, recent information suggests
   that pre-settlement factors may also produce an effect on population
   abundance, mediated by changes in traits of settlers. For instance,
   larvae experiencing food stress may give rise to juveniles with reduced
   energy reserves, growth rate, and in consequence with a low life
   expectancy. Thus, such trait-mediated (e.g. life historical,
   physiological) effects propagate through different life phases of the
   complex life cycles of benthic invertebrates, ultimately affecting
   juvenile survival. In this paper, I discuss the potential role of this
   special kind of trait-mediated effect (abbreviated here as DELPHIs) on
   benthic communities. I show that DELPHIs may affect the shape of the
   stock-settlement function leading to an erroneous interpretation of the
   role of post-settlement factors on benthic communities. Mortality due to
   DELPHIs is the consequence of pre-settlement factors but may be
   confounded with mortality due to post-settlement factors. In this
   regard, I conclude that the only solution to avoid this error is to
   incorporate measurements of traits of individuals in settlement and
   recruitment studies. Besides, DELPHIs may allow for complex interactions
   between pre- and post-settlement processes, suggesting that dichotomous
   views about the role of pre- and post-settlement processes are not
   appropriate. Finally, I suggest that future field research in benthic

TI The structuring role of free-floating versus submerged plants in a
   subtropical shallow lake
SO AQUATIC ECOLOGY
DT Article
AB In shallow temperate lakes many ecological processes depend on submerged
   macrophytes. In subtropical and tropical lakes, free-floating
   macrophytes may be equally or more important. We tested the hypothesis
   that different macrophyte growth forms would be linked with different
   bottom-up and top-down mechanisms in out-competing phytoplankton. We
   compared experimentally the effects of submerged and free-floating
   plants on water chemistry, phytoplankton biomass, zooplankton and fish
   community structure in a shallow hypertrophic lake (Lake Rodo, 34degrees
   55' S 56degrees10' W, Uruguay). Except for the retention of suspended
   solids, we found no other significant bottom-up process connected with
   either Eichhornia crassipes or Potamogeton pectinatus. Free-floating
   plants had a lower abundance of medium-sized zooplankton than any other
   microhabitat and submerged plants were apparently preferred by
   microcrustaceans. Fish showed a differential habitat use according to
   species, size-class and feeding habits. Dominant omnivore-planktivores,
   particularly the smallest size classes, preferred submerged plants. In
   contrast, omnivore-piscivores were significantly associated with
   free-floating plants. The density of omnivorous-planktivorous fish, by
   size class, significantly explained the distribution of medium-sized
   zooplankton, the high number of size 0 fish being the main factor. The
   abiotic environment and the structure of the zooplankton community
   explained little of the fish distribution pattern. Our results suggest
   that bottom-up effects of free-floating plants are weak when cover is
   low or intermediate. Top-down effects are complex, as effects on
   zooplankton and fish communities seem contradictory. The low piscivores:
   planktivores ratio in all microhabitats suggests, however, that
   cascading effects on phytoplankton through free-floating plant impacts
   on piscivorous fish are unlikely to be strong.

TI Temporal trends in species composition and plant traits in natural
   grasslands of Uruguay
SO JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE
DT Article
AB We report the successional trends of the major life-forms (graminoids
   and forbs) in natural grasslands of Uruguay over a 9-yr period after the
   removal of domestic herbivores. For the whole community, species
   richness and diversity decreased over the successional period. In
   graminoids we observed clear temporal trajectories in floristic
   composition; the rate of floristic change decreased with time and was
   associated with a shift in plant traits. The exclusion of large
   herbivores promoted erect and tall grasses with narrow leaves and
   greater seed length, vegetative growth constrained to the cool season
   and increased frequency of annual species. Forbs did not show a clear
   temporal trend in species composition, but there was, nevertheless, a
   plot-specific species turnover of this functional group that was
   reflected in their attributes. Species spreading by means of rhizomes,
   with vegetative growth restricted to the warm season. Species with
   larger seeds increased under grazing exclusion, as did annual and
   nitrogen-fixing forbs. The floristic changes induced by cattle exclusion
   occurred early in the succession. This early high rate of change has
   practical implications for management and conservation programs of the
   natural grasslands of Uruguay. Additionally, the shift in plant traits
   may be helpful in devising simple indicators of grazing impact.

TI Aspects of the oviposition of Anacassis fuscata (Coleoptera :
   Chrysomelidae) on annual and seasonal leaves of its host plant,
   Baccharidastrum triplinervium (Asteraceae), in field conditions
SO ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY
DT Article
AB This study deals with the description, in field conditions, of the
   oviposition preferences and mortality at the egg stage of the proposed
   biocontrol agent Anacassis fuscata on its host plant, Baccharidastrum
   triplinervium, in Southern Uruguay. Egg clusters were classified
   according to their location on the adaxial or abaxial surface of annual
   or seasonal leaves. The main tendencies were a very high preference for
   the oviposition on annual compared with seasonal leaves, and a lack of
   preference for the adaxial or the abaxial surfaces of the leaf. We
   propose that this behavior has evolved to create a niche separation
   between early stage larvae and conspecific adults. Temporal variations
   in the ovipositing preferences were observed throughout the 2-mo
   oviposition period, which can be related to changes in the phenology of
   the host plant. Egg mortality was high in both years studied, and showed
   variability. The highest incidence was found on the adaxial surface of
   seasonal leaves, a finding that may be related with an observed low
   preference for the oviposition on this site. Egg size was smaller in
   Uruguay than in Argentina and Brazil, which might be explained by the
   fact that in Uruguay the average number of eggs per cluster is higher.
   Based on our observations that A. fuscata is a latent species, and that
   intensive defoliation by larvae does not affect the viability of the
   host plant, we conclude that even when A. fuscata has features that make
   it a good candidate for the control of Baccharis and Baccharidastrum, it
   is not an effective agent for biocontrol under field conditions.

TI Larval performance in an estuarine crab, Chasmagnathus granulata, is a
   consequence of both larval and embryonic experience
SO MARINE ECOLOGY-PROGRESS SERIES
DT Article
AB In an experimental laboratory investigation on an estuarine crab,
   Chasmagnathus granulata Dana, we investigated how salinities experienced
   during embryonic and larval development (embryonic and larval salinity
   exposures, respectively) and intraspecific variability of initial
   biomass at egg laying and hatching affected larval performance. The
   latter was measured in terms of survival rate, duration of development
   through successive stages, frequency of occurrence of an additional
   (fifth) zoeal stage, and size of the first juvenile instar. Ovigerous
   female crabs were maintained at 3 salinities (15, 20, 32parts per
   thousand). For each egg mass, biomass of freshly laid eggs and of
   freshly hatched larvae, respectively, was measured as dry mass, carbon,
   and nitrogen contents. After hatching, the larvae were reared at
   salinities of 5, 10, 15, and 32parts per thousand. When larvae hatched
   from eggs that had been incubated at reduced salinities (15 or 20parts
   per thousand), their survival through the zoea I stage at low salinities
   (5 and 10parts per thousand) was high and stage duration was short. By
   contrast, poor survival and delayed development were observed in larvae
   reared at low salinities when they hatched from eggs that had been
   incubated in full-strength seawater (32parts per thousand). Larval
   rearing in seawater allowed generally for highest survival and shortest
   development. While the embryonic salinity exposure had a strong
   influence on the performance of the first zoeal stage, later stages
   showed no significant response to the previous conditions of egg
   incubation. At advanced stages, low larval salinity exposure (15parts
   per thousand) led to consistently lower survival, longer duration of
   development, and higher proportion of larvae passing through an
   additional zoeal instar. However, larger juveniles metamorphosed from
   larvae that hatched from eggs incubated at low (15parts per thousand)
   salinity. The initial biomass of eggs and larvae, which varied
   significantly among broods produced by different females, was identified
   as another-factor affecting larval performance. At constant 32parts per
   thousand, larvae with high initial biomass showed higher survival and
   faster development. Significantly more larvae developed through an
   additional instar when they hatched with a low initial biomass. In
   conclusion, our results show that the performance in a given phase of a
   complex life-history depends not only on the present environmental
   conditions but also on those prevailing in the preceding phase.
   Moreover, intraspecific variability in maternal energy investment into
   offspring production may play a significant role for the chances of
   larval survival and development in the plankton.

CL QUEBEC CITY, CANADA
AB We reviewed the scientific literature published from 1940 to 2002 on
   Latin American (Mexican and Central and South American) deer (Mammalia:
   Cervidae), focusing on conservation status and prediction of geographic
   distributions. The extant Latin American deer are the most diverse deer
   assemblage in the world (Cervinae: one genus, one species: Elk [Cervus
   elaphus]; Odocoilineae: six genera, 18 species: White-tailed deer
   [Odocoileus virginianus], mule deer [O. hemionus], marsh deer
   [Blastocerus dochotomus], pampas deer [Ozotoceros bezoarticus], huemul
   [Hippocamelus bisulcus], taruca [Hippocamelus antisensis], greater pudu
   [Pudu mephistophiles], lesser pudu [Pudu pudu], and six recognized
   species of brocket deer [Mazama americana, M. gouazoubira, M. nana, M.
   bricenni, M. chunyi, and M. rufina] as well as three recently proposed
   species [M. pandora, M. rondoni, and M. bororo]). Within this group,
   three genera (Odocoileus, Hippocamelus, and Blastocerus) have been well
   studied, whereas the genus Mazama, P. puda, P. mephistophiles, and H.
   antisensis have received little attention. The marsh deer, pampas deer,
   taruca, huemul, lesser pudu, and two Mazama species (Mazama nana and M.
   bororo) are the most endangered species. They are each listed as
   Convention International for the Trade of Endangered Species Appendix I
   and are considered by the International Union for Nature Conservation to
   be near threatened or endangered. We updated or created distribution
   maps for these species. Current research predominantly centres on easily
   available species (e.g., white-tailed deer in Mexico) or endangered
   species (e.g., marsh deer in Brazil). In contrast, the ecology and
   conservation status of the pudu, taruca, and Mazama sp. remain largely

TI Marine intrusions in a coastal lagoon enhance the negative effect of
   solar UV radiation on phytoplankton photosynthetic rates
RID E-5335-2011
SO MARINE ECOLOGY-PROGRESS SERIES
DT Article
AB Between March 1997 and May 1999, we studied the effect of solar UV-B
   (290 to 320 nm) and UV-A (320 to 400 nm) radiation on phytoplankton
   photosynthetic rates in a shallow coastal lagoon with periodic exchange
   with the Atlantic Ocean. In particular, we assessed whether the exchange
   with the ocean affected the severity of photosynthetic inhibition.
   During events of marine intrusion, the UV attenuation coefficient (K-d)
   in the brackish zone decreased up to 70% of the values observed under
   the influence of the freshwater discharge. The highest inhibition of the
   PAR-saturated photosynthetic rates by UV radiation (up to 55%) was
   observed in summer at the brackish zone in association with marine
   intrusion events. In the freshwater zone, the highest inhibition was up
   to 3-fold lower than in the brackish area due to higher K-d values in
   the UV range. On average for the entire system, near-surface primary
   production was reduced by ca. 25%, and the contribution by UV-A and UV-B
   was close to 2:1. Our results provide a baseline for future comparisons
   at a latitude where predicted trends in reduction of stratospheric ozone
   are significant. However, hydrological changes affecting river discharge
   and communication frequency with the ocean appear to be more important
   for the UV underwater climate and primary production than the expected
   increase in incident UV-B fluxes.

TI Macroecology of population dynamics and life history traits of the mole
   crab Emerita brasiliensis in Atlantic sandy beaches of South America
SO MARINE ECOLOGY-PROGRESS SERIES
DT Article
AB Several studies have shown consistent macroinfauna community patterns in
   sandy beaches that could be mainly explained by variations in physical
   factors (i.e. grain size, beach slope, swash processes). However, the
   macroecology of population dynamics and biogeographic patterns in life
   history traits have not been adequately assessed in sandy beach ecology.
   Here, we examine the latitudinal variation of population dynamics and
   life history traits of the Sandy intertidal mole crab Emerita
   brasiliensis in sandy beaches along the entire range of the species
   distribution of some 2700 km of the Atlantic coast of South America.
   Population structure by sex and size, individual growth, natural
   mortality, and the length-fecundity and length-weight relationships were
   compared. Most of the life history and population dynamics features of
   Emerita brasiliensis show clear geographical patterns: (1) a shift from
   continuous to seasonal reproductive and recruitment events from
   subtropical to temperate sandy beaches; (2) an increase in the
   individual size of the smallest ovigerous female and in the fecundity at
   size (length-fecundity relationship) from subtropical to temperate
   beaches; (3) a higher predominance of females towards temperate beaches;
   (4) an increase in male sizes towards subtropical beaches, following a
   direct relationship with mean water temperature of the surface zone; (5)
   a significant correlation between female growth parameters (L-infinity =
   inverse and K and phi' = direct) and surface water temperature; (6) an
   increase in the individual weight at size (length-weight relationship)
   from subtropical to temperate beaches, both for males and females; and
   (7) a linear decrease in life span and an asymptotic increase in natural
   mortality (both sexes) from temperate to subtropical beaches. The
   additional effect of morphodynamics at a regional scale was also
   detected, and in some cases masked or ameliorated clear latitudinal
   trends. Populations on dissipative beaches had a more extended
   reproductive season than in reflective beaches, as well as higher growth
   performance, fecundity and somatic weight at size. The decreasing
   occurrence of females in subtropical beaches might explain the
   unexpected but consistently increasing male crab sizes towards lower
   latitudes. This supports the hypothesis of asymmetric intraspecific
   competition between sexes, which may be considered a critical regulating
   process in sandy beach populations.

TI Ontogeny of osmoremilation, physiological plasticity and larval export
   strategy in the grapsid crab Chasmagnathus granulata (Crustacea,
   Decapoda)
SO MARINE ECOLOGY-PROGRESS SERIES
DT Article
AB The grapsid crab Chasmagnathus granulata populates brackish-water
   lagoons and other estuarine environments. In its reproduction, this
   species follows a strategy of larval export, i.e. its larvae live under
   different salinity conditions from the juveniles and adults. In the
   present experimental investigation, ontogenetic changes in the
   capability for osmoregulation were studied in all 4 zoeal stages, the
   megalopa, the juvenile crab instars I, II and IV, and adults (all reared
   in seawater, 32parts per thousand). Moreover, we studied effects of
   embryonic and larval acclimation on osmoregulation, The zoea I larvae
   were slight hyper-regulators at low salinities (10 to 17parts per
   thousand) and hyper-osmoconformers at higher salinities. Stages II to IV
   zoeae were generally hyper-osmoconformers. At metamorphosis to the
   megalopa, the type of osmoregulation changed to hyper-hypo-regulation.
   The osmoregulatory capacities under both hypo- and hypersaline
   conditions increased strongly in the crab I and throughout later
   juvenile development. These patterns in osmoregulation match the
   ontogenetic changes that typically occur in the ecology of C. granulata:
   the zoea I hatches in brackish estuarine waters, where the juveniles and
   adults live, before it is exported to coastal marine zones. This initial
   larval stage is euryhaline and capable of hyper-osmoregulation at low
   salinities. The same capabilities were observed in the megalopa, which
   re-invades the brackish adult environment. This stage is known to settle
   in semiterrestrial habitats near the adult burrows, where both brackish
   and hypersaline conditions are likely to occur; this coincides with the
   first ontogenetic appearance of the hyper-hypo-osmoregulation pattern,
   The zoeal stages II, III and IV, in contrast, develop in the adjacent
   sea, where the salinity is higher and more stable. Correspondingly,
   these intermediate larval stages were found to be stenohaline
   osmoconformers. Preceding exposure of the eggs and larvae to a reduced
   salinity (20parts per thousand) enhanced the hyper-osmoregulatory
   capacity at low salinities (5 to 10parts per thousand) in all zoeal
   stages. This indicates an effect of non-genetic acclimation and, hence,
   phenotypic plasticity. This trait should have an adaptive value, as it
   increases the chance of larval survival, at least in the initial larval
   stage, which is in the field exposed to highly variable, mostly reduced
   salinities.

TI Relationship between species richness and morphodynamics in sandy
   beaches: what are the underlying factors?
SO MARINE ECOLOGY-PROGRESS SERIES
DT Article
AB One of the most documented generalisations in sandy beach ecology is the
   trend for species richness of macroinvertebrates to decrease along a
   morphodynamic gradient from the dissipative to the reflective condition.
   This widely documented pattern remains unexplained, because the
   responsible ecological factors and underlying biological processes are
   still unknown. It has been proposed that swash condition, which changes
   significantly along the morphodynamic gradient, is the key limiting
   factor underlying this biological pattern. In this study, I suggest that
   2 other physical factors could also be involved: sediment grain size and
   erosion-accretion dynamics. This proposal is supported by a 2 yr study
   of 12 sandy beaches in Chile, which showed that grain size becomes
   coarser, erosion-accretion dynamics more intense, and swash frequency
   and velocity increase as morphodynamic conditions change from
   dissipative to reflective extremes. I propose that these 3 environmental
   factors, although physically interrelated, may have independent
   influences on different biological processes or species. I suggest
   therefore that the reduction of species towards the reflective extreme
   is caused by increasing environmental severity, which is generated by
   the action (of at least) the 3 physical factors mentioned above. This
   proposal constitutes the hypothesis of 'multicausal environmental
   severity', which agrees with the large interspecific variability in the
   life history and ecological traits of sandy beach communities, since it
   admits that species with different characteristics could be controlled
   by different limiting factors. Thus, the present hypothesis provides a
   more general and flexible framework for investigating the relationship
   between species richness and morphodynamics in sandy beaches.

TI Testing the swash exclusion hypothesis in sandy beach populations: the
   mole crab Emerita brasiliensis in Uruguay
SO MARINE ECOLOGY-PROGRESS SERIES
DT Article
AB Exposed marine beaches are physically rigorous habitats in which
   macrofauna community patterns have been well correlated with physical
   factors such as grain size, beach slope and wave/swash processes. In
   this context, the swash exclusion hypothesis (SEH) gained wide
   acceptability in explaining the control of species abundance and
   diversity of the sandy beach macrofauna by swash climate, determined by
   wave height and beach face slope. This hypothesis predicts a consistent
   increase in species richness, abundance and biomass from reflective to
   dissipative conditions. However, predictions of the SEH have not been
   adequately tested at a population level. Here, demographic and life
   history characteristics of the intertidal mole crab Emerita brasiliensis
   were compared between populations of 2 microtidal exposed sandy beaches
   with contrasting morphodynamics during 22 consecutive months. The major
   prediction of the paradigm does not hold for the mole crab: total
   abundance, as well as that of males, females, males with spermatophores
   and megalops did not differ between beaches. Moreover, the reflective
   beach population presented higher male growth rates in size and lower
   natural mortality. Other population processes and life history traits
   gave support for the SEH: the dissipative beach population presented (1)
   higher abundance of ovigerous females, female growth rates, fecundity,
   egg production potential, size at maturity, as well as weight at size;
   and (2) lower female mortality and burrowing rates (for both sexes). The
   SEH seems to be particularly useful in explaining female somatic growth
   and reproductive features, which could be related to a major amount of
   food availability in dissipative beaches. However, other competing, but
   not exclusive, hypotheses are needed to explain variations in population
   abundance and other processes such as male growth and survivorship. The
   empirical evidence from several recent studies on the Uruguayan coast
   showed that sandy beach populations that co-occur in contrasting
   environments are less sensitive to variations in beach morphodynamics,
   which should not be considered the primary factor affecting the
   abundance and some life history traits. The importance of alternative
   population regulation processes and mechanisms are stressed.
