"./data/WOS2011/uruguay.txt","Stable isotopes and mass-balance trophic models (e.g., ECOPATH) are
well-known and widely used approximations to describe food-web
structure, but their consistency is not properly established. Here we
analyze the food-web structure of a subtropical-temperate coastal lagoon
using two approaches: stable isotopic techniques and mass-balance
modelling, exploring also the correspondence between the outputs of both
methods. We compared trophic positions (TPs) derived by these two
approaches for 14 consumers in Laguna de Rocha (LR).TPs based on stable
isotopes were taken from a recent study. ECOPATH trophic levels were
estimated by a model presented here constructed based on field data for
the period 2003-2006 and literature data. The model incorporated over 50
species in 27 trophic groups, including primary producers, invertebrate
and vertebrate consumers. The origin and quality of data (pedigree
routine) indicated that 68% of the information was locally bound,
although several unknowns were detected. Birds and mammals represented
the highest trophic levels (4.2 and 3.98, respectively). Network
analysis estimated a size of the system (fluxes and biomasses) of 451 t
wet weight km(-2) year(-1), while transfer efficiency, primary
production/respiration and production/biomass ratios, and several
ecological indexes characterized LR as an underdeveloped system. TPs
derived from isotopic analysis were highly correlated with trophic
levels estimated by ECOPATH according to a linear regression model
through the origin (r(2) = 0.82, n = 14, p << 0.01). The slope of the
linear model (0.88 +/- 0.019, estimate +/- SD) indicated that TPs
derived from isotopic analyses were slightly higher (similar to 13.5% on
average) than those derived from the mass-balance model. Current results
support the overall consistency of the use of both stable isotopes and
mass-balance modelling approaches as descriptors of this aquatic
food-web. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

feature with a detritivory herbivory ratio of 0 42 in the dissipative
beach and 0 51 in the reflective indicating a higher utilization of the
primary production in the former The aggregation analysis showed five

"./data/WOS2011/uruguay.txt","Community assembly rules theory attempt to understand the processes that
determine the composition of local communities from a regional species
pool. Nestedness and negative co-occurrence are two of the most commonly
reported meta-community patterns, but almost exclusively from
terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems. Here we analyzed the structure of
species coexistence in six datasets containing presence/absence data for
120 marine benthic gastropod species in 249 sampling units on the
Uruguayan continental shelf and Rio de la Plata estuary. The ecological
features of this system, such as the idiosyncratic nature of the
biogeographic and oceanographic realms, are clearly different from those
observed in other systems previously targeted by studies on coexistence
structure. Community patterns were evaluated using null models and four
structure indices. The existence of patterns in community assembly, and
in particular segregated co-occurrence, was verified only when analyzing
the number of checkerboard units (CH index). This indicates more
mutually exclusive species pairs than expected by chance. Nestedness, on
the other hand, was not detected in any dataset. Storage and rescue
effects related to overall high immigration and low local extinction
rates are plausible mechanisms to account for the general pattern of
random species coexistence, while the segregated co-occurrence pattern
depicted by the CH index may be related to differential habitat
requirements within species pairs. Our study highlights the importance
of analyzing metacommunity structures in alternative biological,
environmental, and historical contexts in order to advance on the
construction of a general ecological theory, relating patterns with the
processes dominating in particular ecosystems.

"./data/WOS2011/uruguay.txt","Question
How does the ant Atta vollenweideri indirectly affect the shrub
Grabowskia duplicata? Does environmental modification induced by nest
building affect the life history and population structure of this
dominant shrub?
Location
Halophytic savanna of western Uruguay, South America.
Methods
We compared the density of three shrub size classes, seedlings, saplings
and adults, among patches created by ant nest building and in
non-modified areas. We studied key soil properties for plant growth in
both live nests and non-modified areas. We performed a greenhouse
experiment to study the effects of soils (live nest versus non-modified
area) on shrub germination probability. We also assessed vegetative
propagation by measuring the incidence of root suckers and clonal
offshoots in live nests and non-modified areas through a field survey.
Results
Seedling-size class was more abundant on live nests than in non-modified
areas, suggesting that environmental conditions of this type of habitat
(i.e. increased sodium and moisture content of soil, and decreased soil
compaction) could facilitate shrub recruitment. We did not find any
effects of soil type (live nests versus non-modified areas) on shrub
germination probability. However, the vegetative propagation incidence
was higher in the environment with live nests.
Conclusions
We found a strong indirect relationship between the ant A. vollenweideri
and the shrub G. duplicata. This relationship seems to be mediated by an
allogenic engineering process, i.e. soil bioturbation caused by nest
building. The environmental conditions of live nests seem to facilitate
shrub recruitment, mainly by increasing vegetative propagation.

The species, originally described from Puerto Rico, Texas and Florida,
has also been recorded for Brazilian beaches from 21A degrees S to 26A
degrees S as well as for harbours of Australia, New Zealand and the Sea
of Japan. The southward spreading rate of this bryozoan along the

km year(-1). The chances that this invasion could proceed southwards in
the Southwest Atlantic and the possible impacts that it may be causing
are discussed. The case of M. tubigera seems to be qualitatively and
quantitatively different from those of other alien bryozoans previously

pervasive ecological impact of invasion by exotic species in the

"./data/WOS2011/uruguay.txt","Question: How does above-ground net primary production (ANPP) differ
(estimated from remotely sensed data) among vegetation units in
sub-humid temperate grasslands?
Location: Centre-north Uruguay.
Methods: A vegetation map of the study area was generated from LANDSAT
imagery and the landscape configuration described. The functional
heterogeneity of mapping units was analysed in terms of the fraction of
photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by green vegetation (fPAR),
calculated from the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) images
provided by the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS)
sensor. Finally, the ANPP of each grassland class was estimated using
NDVI and climatic data.
Results: Supervised classification presented a good overall accuracy and
moderate to good average accuracy for grassland classes. Meso-xerophytic
grasslands occupied 45% of the area, Meso-hydrophytic grasslands 43% and
Lithophytic steppes 6%. The landscape was shaped by a matrix of large,
unfragmented patches of Meso-xerophytic and Meso-hydrophytic grasslands.
The region presented the lowest anthropic fragmentation degree reported
for the Rio de la Plata grasslands. All grassland units showed bimodal
annual fPAR seasonality, with spring and autumn peaks. Meso-hydrophytic
grasslands showed a radiation interception 10% higher than the other
units. On an annual basis, Meso-hydrophytic grasslands produced 3800 kg
dry matter (DM) ha(-1) yr(-1) and Meso-xerophytic grasslands and
Lithophytic steppes around 3400 kg.DM.ha(-1).yr(-1). Meso-xerophytic
grasslands had the largest spatial variation during most of the year.
The ANPP temporal variation was higher than the fPAR variability.
Conclusions: Our results provide valuable information for grazing
management (identifying spatial and temporal variations of ANPP) and
grassland conservation (identifying the spatial distribution of
vegetation units).

forms an empirical basis to link ageing, life span, sex differences and

"./data/WOS2011/uruguay.txt","Several conceptual models relating biological and morphodynamic
variables have been developed in sandy beach ecology. On estuarine sandy
beaches, a major environmental factor influencing macrofaunal
distribution is salinity. In this setting, the concurrent role of
large-scale estuarine and morphodynamic gradients in shaping demographic
patterns is still uncertain. To explain largescale variations in
demographic aspects of the mole crab Emerita brasiliensis, 16 Uruguayan
sandy beaches distributed along the estuarine gradient generated by the
Rio de la Plata were characterized in terms of beach morphology,
sediment traits and salinity over a 2 yr period. Abundance (total and
discriminated by reproductive and recruitment components), biomass and
body size of E. brasiliensis significantly increased from estuarine
reflective to oceanic dissipative beaches. Further, generalized models
(both additive and linear) showed that salinity, mean grain size and
swash width were the most important explanatory factors of
spatio-temporal variations in abundance. Sexually mature individuals and
megalopae were almost absent in estuarine and oceanic: reflective
beaches, whereas oceanic dissipative beaches showed polymodal size
structures with fully represented population components, together with
extended reproductive and recruitment periods. We conclude that (1)
morphodynamic and estuarine gradients are inextricably linked, affecting
mole crab demography; and (2) estuarine and oceanic reflective beaches
operate as sink habitats where populations do not prosper, whereas
oceanic dissipative beaches act as source habitats. We thus provide
empirical support to the source-sink hypothesis recently developed for
sandy beaches. These long-term variations in demographic processes
should be complemented by connectivity studies and genetic analyses in
order to gain a deeper understanding of metapopulation dynamics in sandy
beaches.

"./data/WOS2011/uruguay.txt","Ulrich Brose Body size is recognized as an important determinant of
trophic structure as it affects individual energetic demands, population
density, and the interaction between potential prey and predators.
However, its relationship with trophic position remains unclear. It has
been hypothesized that a positive relationship between body size and
trophic position would be associated to some particular trophic
structures, which would allow larger organisms to satisfy their
energetic demand and sustain viable population sizes at higher trophic
positions, where fewer resources are available. To test this hypothesis,
we analyzed the diet of 619 killifishes from four species (Austrolebias
cheradophilus, A. luteoflammulatus, A. viarius and Cynopoecilus
melanotaenia), collected in temporary ponds occurring in the grasslands
of Rocha, Uruguay. Trophic position, diet richness, number of energy
sources, and evenness were estimated for 20 size classes, formed by
consecutive groups of 31 individuals. Gape limitation and preference for
the larger available prey were evaluated as explanations for observed
patterns with an individual based model (IBM). In agreement with the
hypothesis, killifishes presented a strong positive relationship between
trophic position and body size (R2=0.86), associated with a trophic
structure that could allow larger organisms to have access to more
energy from the environment. This was reflected in a positive
relationship between body size and 1) prey richness, 2) number of basal
energy sources (i.e. plants, detritus, phytoplankton and terrestrial
prey), and 3) evenness in prey use. IBM results showed that changes in
trophic structure with body size are well explained by gape limitation,
but not by size preferences. Our results suggest that the fulfilment of
the greater energetic demands of larger organism will depend on
community diversity, which typically increases with ecosystem size,
indicating a novel connection between area, diversity, body size, and
food chain length.

"./data/WOS2011/uruguay.txt","Limnoperna fortunei (Dunker, 1857) (Bivalvia) invaded Argentina through
the Rio de la Plata estuary around 1990 and is presently established
throughout five South American countries as a dominant component of the
benthic fauna and a major nuisance for industry and power plants.
Between 1997 and 2006 we monitored the reproductive activity of L.
fortunei through weekly measurements of planktonic larvae in six South
American water bodies: Rio de la Plata estuary, Parana and Carapachay
rivers, Salto Grande, ItaipU and Embalse de Rio Tercero reservoirs. Mean
larval densities varied between 4000 and 7000 individuals m-3; except in
the reservoirs of ItaipU (450 ind. m-3) and Salto Grande (869 ind. m-3),
where the mussel was first recorded shortly before our surveys, and
upstream dispersal is limited (Salto Grande). In all cases, reproductive
output decreases during the winter. At four of the six sites surveyed
larval densities were comparatively high for 8.8-10.2 months per year. A
lower food supply is possibly responsible for the shorter reproductive
period of 5.9 months at Embalse. At Salto Grande, there is a
well-defined mid-summer drop in larval numbers, coinciding with blooms
of cyanobacteria. We propose that, in addition to temperature, two major
factors may regulate the reproductive activity of L. fortunei: (i) the
availability of food; and (ii) blooms of toxic cyanobacteria,
significantly shortening the otherwise very long reproductive period.
This information is important for the design of antifouling programmes
involving the use of molluscicides, and has potential for reduced
biocide use. These results provide supporting evidence for some
fundamental ecological theories of invasions discussed here.

"./data/WOS2011/uruguay.txt","One of the most conspicuous and widely analyzed patterns in ecology is
the latitudinal gradient in species richness. Over the 200 years since
its recognition, several hypotheses have accumulated in order to account
for spatial variations in diversity. Geographic variations in
seasonality have been repeatedly proposed as a determinant of community
richness. However, the geographic structure of community seasonality has
not yet been analyzed. In the present work we evaluated three hypotheses
that account for variations in the temporal structuring of communities:
first, environmental seasonality determines community seasonality;
second, community richness determines its degree of structuring; and
third, the presence of an increase in species segregation with latitude,
reflected in a pattern of species negative co-occurrence. The hypotheses
were evaluated using path analysis on 29 amphibian communities from
South America, connecting latitude, environmental conditions, diversity,
seasonality, and coexistence structure - nestedness and negative
co-occurrence - within communities. Latitude positively affects
community seasonality through an increase in temperature seasonality,
but a weak negative direct effect suggests that other variables not
considered in the model - such as the strength of biotic interactions -
could also be involved. Both latitude and diversity (directly and
indirectly) determine an increase in negative co-occurrence and
nestedness. This suggests that groups of species that are mutually
nested in time are internally segregated. Further, the strength of this
structure is determined by community diversity and latitude. Temporal
structuring of a community is associated with latitude and diversity,
pointing to the existence of a systematic change in community
organization far beyond, but probably interrelated, with the recognized
latitudinal trend in richness. The available information and analysis
supported the three hypotheses evaluated.

"./data/WOS2011/uruguay.txt","One of the strongest indications that cryptic female choice is an
evolutionary phenomenon of general importance is the widespread
existence of male courtship behavior during copulation. It has been
presumed that such copulatory courtship functions to induce female
reproductive behavior that favors the male's reproductive interests, but
this function has seldom been demonstrated. Here, we examine the
possible effects of male copulatory courtship in the spider Leucauge
mariana (Tetragnathidae) on whether a female will aid the male in
forming a copulatory plug, thus reducing the chances that future mates
will be able to inseminate her. Greater numbers of 2 behavior patterns
by the male during copulation, rhythmic pushing on the female's legs
with his front legs, and repeated short insertions with his genitalia
were associated with increased chances that the female would cooperate
in plug formation. This confirms that these behavior patterns do indeed
function as courtship.

"./data/WOS2011/uruguay.txt","A positive feedback between submerged vegetation and water clarity forms
the backbone of the alternative state theory in shallow lakes. The water
clearing effect of aquatic vegetation may be caused by different
physical, chemical, and biological mechanisms and has been studied
mainly in temperate lakes. Recent work suggests differences in biotic
interactions between (sub)tropical and cooler lakes might result in a
less pronounced clearing effect in the (sub)tropics. To assess whether
the effect of submerged vegetation changes with climate, we sampled 83
lakes over a gradient ranging from the tundra to the tropics in South
America. Judged from a comparison of water clarity inside and outside
vegetation beds, the vegetation appeared to have a similar positive
effect on the water clarity across all climatic regions studied.
However, the local clearing effect of vegetation decreased steeply with
the contribution of humic substances to the underwater light
attenuation. Looking at turbidity on a whole-lake scale, results were
more difficult to interpret. Although lakes with abundant vegetation (>
30%) were generally clear, sparsely vegetated lakes differed widely in
clarity. Overall, the effect of vegetation on water clarity in our lakes
appears to be smaller than that found in various Northern hemisphere
studies. This might be explained by differences in fish communities and
their relation to vegetation. For instance, unlike in Northern
hemisphere studies, we find no clear relation between vegetation
coverage and fish abundance or their diet preference. High densities of
omnivorous fish and coinciding low grazing pressures on phytoplankton in
the (sub)tropics may, furthermore, weaken the effect of vegetation on
water clarity.

"./data/WOS2011/uruguay.txt","Both nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) can limit primary production in
shallow lakes, but it is still debated how the importance of N and P
varies in time and space. We sampled 83 shallow lakes along a
latitudinal gradient (5 degrees-55 degrees S) in South America and
assessed the potential nutrient limitation using different methods
including nutrient ratios in sediment, water, and seston, dissolved
nutrient concentrations, and occurrence of N-fixing cyanobacteria. We
found that local characteristics such as soil type and associated land
use in the catchment, hydrology, and also the presence of abundant
submerged macrophyte growth influenced N and P limitation. We found
neither a consistent variation in nutrient limitation nor indications
for a steady change in denitrification along the latitudinal gradient.
Contrary to findings in other regions, we did not find a relationship
between the occurrence of (N-fixing and non-N-fixing) cyanobacteria and
the TN:TP ratio. We found N-fixing cyanobacteria (those with
heterocysts) exclusively in lakes with dissolved inorganic nitrogen
(DIN) concentrations of <100 mu g/L, but notably they were also often
absent in lakes with low DIN concentrations. We argue that local factors
such as land use and hydrology have a stronger influence on which
nutrient is limiting than climate. Furthermore, our data show that in a
wide range of climates N limitation does not necessarily lead to
cyanobacterial dominance.

"./data/WOS2011/uruguay.txt","It has been suggested that shallow lakes in warm climates have a higher
probability of being turbid, rather than macrophyte dominated, compared
with lakes in cooler climates, but little field evidence exists to
evaluate this hypothesis. We analyzed data from 782 lake years in
different climate zones in North America, South America, and Europe. We
tested if systematic differences exist in the relationship between the
abundance of submerged macrophytes and environmental factors such as
lake depth and nutrient levels. In the pooled dataset the proportion of
lakes with substantial submerged macrophyte coverage (> 30% of the lake
area) decreased in a sigmoidal way with increasing total phosphorus (TP)
concentration, falling most steeply between 0.05 and 0.2 mg L(-1).
Substantial submerged macrophyte coverage was also rare in lakes with
total nitrogen (TN) concentrations above 1-2 mg L(-1), except for lakes
with very low TP concentrations where macrophytes remain abundant until
higher TN concentrations. The deviance reduction of logistic regression
models predicting macrophyte coverage from nutrients and water depth was
generally low, and notably lowest in tropical and subtropical regions
(Brazil, Uruguay, and Florida), suggesting that macrophyte coverage was
strongly influenced by other factors. The maximum TP concentration
allowing substantial submerged macrophyte coverage was clearly higher in
cold regions with more frost days. This is in agreement with other
studies which found a large influence of ice cover duration on shallow
lakes' ecology through partial fish kills that may improve light
conditions for submerged macrophytes by cascading effects on periphyton
and phytoplankton. Our findings suggest that, in regions where climatic
warming is projected to lead to fewer frost days, macrophyte cover will
decrease unless the nutrient levels are lowered.

"./data/WOS2011/uruguay.txt","Landscape ecology emerged as a terrestrial discipline to evaluate the
effect of spatial configuration of natural systems on ecological
patterns. The advances in marine systems have been comparatively scarce
perhaps as a consequence of a long-standing view about the greater
dispersal potential of marine species and its effect on the spatial
homogenization of marine landscapes. Herein we used an intertidal rocky
system as a model to analyse the effect of landscape attributes on local
species richness and composition. We evaluated the effect of patch area,
landscape connectivity and salinity gradient on local species richness
of macro-invertebrates, and the effect of geographic distance on species
similarity. We sampled 19 rocky patches along the Uruguayan Atlantic
coast one time during the spring of 2003. The relative contribution of
the variables assessed on specific richness of sessile, mobile and total
macrofauna was analysed with a stepwise multiple linear regression. For
the mobile macrofaunal richness, we also incorporated the sessile
macrofaunal richness as another independent variable. The effect of
geographic distance on biological similarity was assessed by a Mantel
test. We showed that landscape connectivity, as a descriptor of the
average physical isolation of a biological community in the landscape,
is an important factor explaining the community species richness for
sessile macrofauna, what indirectly increases the mobile macrofaunal
richness. The geographic distance between sites was negatively related
to species similarity. We suggest that at the landscape scale,
connectivity among sites can be important to understand the local
structure of marine communities, particularly in rocky intertidal
systems. Also the distance-decay of similarity in community composition
provides a useful descriptor of how biological composition varies along
a physical gradient. Our results contribute to reinforce the view that
mesoscale connectivity (10(1-2) km) in coastal marine landscapes plays a
more important role in local community structure than previously
assumed.

Do species traits explain differences in productivity in grazed and
ungrazed plots?
Location
Rio de la Plata grasslands, Uruguay (31 degrees 54'S, 58 degrees 15'W).
Methods
In a greenhouse experiment, we measured the relative growth rate (RGR)
of grasses with contrasting responses to grazing (increasers and
decreasers). We performed six harvests at weekly intervals in order to
calculate the RGR and assess 12 plant traits. We compared the RGR
between increaser and decreaser species after 2 and 5 weeks using
t-tests. Linear and potential regression models were fitted to time
versus natural logarithm of total dry biomass relationships. The RGR
temporal trajectories of increaser and decreaser species were obtained
from the derivatives of the best-fit functions. Principal component
analysis (PCA) was used to sort species according to their traits.
Results
The RGR of decreaser grasses was higher than that of increasers at the
second week, while at the fifth week the opposite was observed. The RGR
of decreasers dropped through time, while the RGR of increaser species
was constant. The PCA separated increaser from decreaser species. The
attributes related to increaser species were: high specific leaf area,
tillering rate, green leaf rate, total leaf number, root weight ratio
and leaf weight ratio; while those associated with decreaser species
were: high dead biomass, senescence rate, reproductive biomass, leaf
elongation rate and total biomass.
Conclusions
Traits possessed by decreasers reduce light availability and increase
the reproductive investment, explaining the drop in RGR. Specific
differences in RGR seem to scale up to the ecosystem level and would
explain the pattern in aboveground net primary production observed in
the field under contrasting grazing regimes.

"./data/WOS2011/uruguay.txt","Shifts between alternative stable states have become a focus of research
in temperate shallow lakes. Here we show that sharp transitions between
a clear, macrophyte-dominated state and a turbid state without submerged
plants can also occur in tropical floodplain lakes, albeit driven by a
largely different set of mechanisms. We show how a shallow lake in the
Pantanal becomes covered by an exploding population of the submerged
macrophyte Egeria najas Planchon as the water level rises during the
annual high-water period. Water clarity increases spectacularly in this
period due to flushing with river water that has lost most of its
suspended matter during its slow flow over the flooded vegetated plains.
A few months later when the water level drops again, the submerged plant
beds die and decompose rapidly, triggering a phase of increasing
turbidity. During this period an increase in dissolved organic matter,
suspended matter, and phytoplankton biomass results in a sharp
deterioration in water clarity. The concomitant water level decrease
largely counteracts the effects on the underwater light climate, so that
the amount of light at the bottom may not differ in comparison with the
high-water period. Therefore, changes in light climate seem unlikely to
be the sole driver of the vegetation shifts, and other mechanisms may
prevent recovery of the submerged vegetation until the next high-water
episode. Also, contrary to what is found in temperate lakes, there is no
evidence for top-down control of phytoplankton biomass associated with
the macrophyte-dominated state in our tropical lake.

"./data/WOS2011/uruguay.txt","This study characterizes the structure of a plant-pollinator network in
a temperate rain forest of Chilo, Island, southern Chile, where woody
species are strongly dependent on biotic pollinators, and analyzes its
robustness to the loss of participating species. Degree distribution,
nestedness, and expected species persistence were evaluated. In
addition, we assessed the roles of predefined subsets of plants
(classified by life forms) and pollinators (grouped by taxonomic orders)
in the network's structure and dynamics. For this, we simulated the
complete removal of each plant and pollinator subset and analyzed the
resultant connectivity patterns, as well as the expected long-term
species losses by running a stochastic model. Finally, we evaluated the
sensitivity of the network structure to the loss of single species in
order to identify potential targets for conservation. Our results show
that the plant-pollinator network of this Chilean temperate rain forest
exhibits a nested structure of interactions, with a degree distribution
best described by a power law model. Model simulations revealed the
importance of trees and hymenopterans as pivotal groups that maintain
the core structure of the pollination network and guarantee overall
species persistence. The hymenopterans Bombus dahlbomii and Diphaglossa
gayi, the shrubs Tepualia stipularis and Ugni molinae, the vines
Mitraria coccinea and Asteranthera ovata, and the entire set of tree
species exerted a disproportionately large influence on the preservation
of network structure and should be considered as focal species for
conservation programs given current threats from selective logging and
habitat loss.

"./data/WOS2011/uruguay.txt","The potential export of nutrients from Eucalyptus plantations harvested
for pulp production may be high. However, depending on the harvest
method, the nutrients from the residue can be recycled. The aims of this
study were (i) to quantify the content and distribution of nutrients in
different residue components at harvest for a Eucalyptus dunnii Maiden
plantation; and (ii) to quantify the decomposition rates of the harvest
residues, and the return of nutrients to the soil in the temperate
climate conditions of Uruguay. Six trees of a 9-year-old E dunnii
plantation with average diameter at breast-height (DBH) were harvested,
and the biomass produced and the N, P, K, Ca and Mg contents in
commercial and non-commercial logs, leaves, branches, bark and litter
were estimated. Decomposition of the remains of leaves, branches,
non-commercial logs, bark and litter was studied in the field for 2
years. Although commercial logs accounted for 61% of the biomass
produced, only 27% of the N, 35% of the P, 18% of the K, 16% of the Ca
and 41% of the Mg present in the forest were exported with the product.
When logs are exported without de-barking in the site, the nutrient
export would increase to 41%, 55%. 46%, 68% and 66% of the total
extraction of N, P, K, Ca and Mg, respectively. Residue decomposition
showed that the leaves lost the highest proportion of biomass (half life
0.86 years), and bark was most resistant to decomposition in the field
(half life 5.36 years). As regards the nutrients, K was lost most
rapidly and Ca showed the slowest loss, while N, P and Mg losses were
generally more gradual, and proportional to the decomposition rate. (C)

"./data/WOS2011/uruguay.txt","We explored the small-scale plant species mobility in a subhumid native
grassland subjected to grazing by cattle in south-western Uruguay. We
established four permanent plots of 40 x 40 cm, divided in 16 x 16
cells. In each cell, the presence of species was seasonally recorded for
2 years and annually recorded for 4 years. By nesting the cells, we
studied the mobility at different scales, from 6.25 cm(2) to 400 cm(2).
At each scale we measured species richness, cumulative richness and the
turnover rates of the dominant species. We found that the cumulative
species richness was an increasing power function, with higher
accumulation rates with smaller spatial scale. Although species richness
showed seasonal fluctuations, the mean species richness was constant
during the study period. We detected significant spatio-temporal
variability in mobility patterns among species. Certain species showed a
high capacity to colonize new sites, whereas other species rotate among
sites that they previously occupied. Grazed communities in Uruguayan
Campos are structured as a dense matrix of perennials grasses and forbs,
where vegetative propagation is the main form of growth of the species.
The small-scale dynamics and the high variability in the mobility
characteristics could be linked with the diversity of growth forms and
spatial strategies of the species in this community. We believe that a
high degree of small-scale spatial dynamics contribute to explain the
species coexistence and the apparent stability of communities at local
scales.

"./data/WOS2011/uruguay.txt","By wrapping prey and offering it as a nuptial gift, males can obtain
mating and/or parental benefits despite some costs. Males of the
Neotropical semiaquatic spider Paratrechalea ornata (Trechaleidae) offer
females a nuptial gift consisting of a prey item wrapped in silk. What
stimulus inhibits males from feeding and elicits gift construction? We
hypothesized that signals associated with female silk threads could
affect decision-making by males. We investigated three groups of males
carrying a captured prey under different experimental treatments. In the
treatment S, males were exposed to an arena with female silk; in SF,
males were exposed to both silk and a female confined in a cell, and in
the control group, males were exposed to a clean arena. Gift
construction was observed only in the S and SF groups, with a similar
occurrence rate. After touching females (SF group), males did not change
their pattern of gift construction. Gift construction occurrence
increased with male and female age. The results lead us to assume that
the existence of chemical cues associated with female silk elicits male
searching behaviour and gift construction, allowing males to decide
between eating or wrapping prey according to the possibility of a sexual
encounter. Anticipating gift construction, males are ready to mate,
diminishing the risks of predation, female desertion or male-male
scramble competition. The effect of age on behavioural variation and the
rate of construction is discussed.

"./data/WOS2011/uruguay.txt","Understanding behavioural adaptations in sandy beach macrofauna has been
a major step in theoretical development of sandy beach ecology. In
particular, behavioural studies in supralittoral amphipods have been
useful in understanding macrofaunal responses and adaptations to
environmental changes in these dynamic ecosystems. The predictions of
the Habitat Safety Hypothesis (HSH) were tested for the first time on
Atlantorchestoidea brasiliensis through orientation experiments carried
out on 2 sandy beaches, one dissipative and the other reflective.
Orientation patterns of A. brasiliensis followed the trend predicted by
the HSH: even though sandhoppers oriented seawards on both beaches using
a sun compass, the orientation on the reflective beach was more precise
than on the dissipative one. Thus, stability conditions in the
supralittoral zone of the reflective beach favoured a higher precision
of the sun compass. The precision of seawards orientation on the
dissipative beach increased when landscape references were added to the
sun compass mechanism. The response to an unexpected object was also
experimentally tested by use of a visual pattern, and a higher
individual variability in the orientation of the reflective beach
population was found. Thus, orientation strategies in sandy beach
environments seem to respond to the stability of the supralittoral zone,
widening the general pattern predicted by the HSH for the supralittoral
fauna to the behavioural traits of the population.

"./data/WOS2011/uruguay.txt","In marine mammals, the transition period between lactation and
independent feeding provides an opportunity to evaluate the influence of
the first solid food on heavy metal concentrations in their tissues at
early stages of their life cycle. The aim of the present study was to
compare mercury, cadmium, zinc and copper levels in lactating and
recently weaned South American fur seal Arctocephalus australis pups
from Uruguay and northern Argentina, in order to evaluate the heavy
metal intake through solid food shortly after weaning. Heavy metal
concentrations in liver, muscle and kidney were determined by atomic
absorption spectroscopy. Mercury levels in suckling pups reached up to
0.60 and 0.40 mu g g(-1) wet weight in liver and kidney tissues,
respectively. This group presented lower levels of cadmium, with maximum
concentrations of 0.11 mu g g(-1) and 0.17 mu g g(-1) in liver and
kidney tissues, respectively. Weaned pups showed significantly higher
levels of both cadmium (liver=6.93 +/- 4.73 mu g g(-1); kidney=20.89 +/-
5.00 mu g g(-1)) and mercury (liver=3.91 +/- 16 mu g g(-1), kidney=0.57
+/- 0.15 mu g g(-1)). These significantly higher levels, and a clear
distributional pattern between organs, strongly suggest a rapid intake
of heavy metals during the first months after weaning. The presence of
mercury and cadmium in weaned pups also indicates relevant early
predation on fish and squid, representing a considerable contribution of
both metals, but mainly cadmium, for South American fur seal pups. This
sharp accumulation could be used as an indicator of the weaning process.
Furthermore, heavy metal levels of pups would constitute a relevant
baseline level in the early life of the South American fur seal.

very important proportion of the present biomass. Bullfrog tadpoles
appear to be displacing native amphibians and having some type of
positive interaction with fishes. At the invaded system we found more
fish species and larger sizes of the shared fish species. We analyze the
involved risks of this invasion, the ecological impact by predation, the
competition and habitat modification, and the potential of bullfrog to
act as pathogens vector. We also recommend taking measures in order to
avoid the expansion of this population. There is also the need of
studies to search for new invasion points in Uruguay, especially where

"./data/WOS2011/uruguay.txt","During recent years, predictive modelling techniques have been
increasingly used to identify regional patterns of species spatial
occurrence, to explore species-habitat relationships and to aid in
biodiversity conservation. In the case of birds, predictive modelling
has been mainly applied to the study of species with little variable
interannual patterns of spatial occurrence (e.g. year-round resident
species or migratory species in their breeding grounds showing
territorial behaviour). We used predictive models to analyse the factors
that determine broad-scale patterns of occurrence and abundance of
wintering Swainson's hawks (Buteo swainsoni). This species has been the
focus of field monitoring in its wintering ground in Argentina due to
massive pesticide poisoning of thousands of individuals during the
1990s, but its unpredictable pattern of spatial distribution and the
uncertainty about the current wintering area occupied by hawks led to
discontinuing such field monitoring. Data on the presence and abundance
of hawks were recorded in 30 x 30 km squares (n = 115) surveyed during
three austral summers (2001-03). Sixteen land-use/land-cover,
topography, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) variables
were used as predictors to build generalized additive models (GAMs).
Both occurrence and abundance models showed a good predictive ability.
Land use, altitude, and NDVI during spring previous to the arrival of
hawks to wintering areas were good predictors of the distribution of
Swainson's hawks in the Argentine pampas, but only land use and NDVI
were entered into the model of abundance of the species in the region.
The predictive cartography developed from the models allowed us to
identify the current wintering area of Swainson's hawks in the Argentine
pampas. The highest occurrence probability and relative abundances for
the species were predicted for a broad area of south-eastern pampas that
has been overlooked so far and where neither field research nor
conservation efforts aiming to prevent massive mortalities has been
established.

"./data/WOS2011/uruguay.txt","The influence of seed dispersers on the evolution of fruit traits
remains controversial, largely because most studies have failed to
account for phylogeny and or have focused on conservative taxonomic
levels. Under the hypothesis that fruit traits have evolved in response
to different sets of selective pressures by disparate types of seed
dispersers (the dispersal syndromes hypothesis), we test for two
dispersal syndromes, defined as groups of fruit traits that appear
together more often than expected by chance. (1) Bird syndrome fruits
are brightly colored and small, because birds have acute color vision,
and commonly swallow fruits whole. (2) Mammal syndrome fruits are
dull-colored and larger on average than bird syndrome fruits, because
mammals do not rely heavily on visual cues for finding fruits, and can
eat fruits piecemeal. If, instead, phylogenetic inertia determines the
co-occurrence of fruit size and color, we will observe that specific
combinations of size and color evolved in a small number of ancestral
species. We performed a comparative analysis of fruit traits for 64
species of Ficus (Moraceae), based on a phylogeny we constructed using
nuclear ribosomal DNA. Using a concentrated changes test and assuming
fruit color is an independent variable, we found that small-sized fruits
evolve on branches with red and purple figs, as predicted by the
dispersal syndromes hypothesis. When using diameter as the independent
variable, results vary with the combination of algorithms used, which is
discussed in detail. A likelihood ratio test confirms the pattern found
with the concentrated changes test using color as the independent
variable. These results support the dispersal syndromes hypothesis.

"./data/WOS2011/uruguay.txt","It has been suggested that declines in breeding populations of
Swainson's hawks (Buteo swainsoni) in California, Oregon, and Nevada may
be due to differential mortality of hawks on their wintering grounds.
Although massive mortality incidents reported on the wintering grounds
partially support this suggestion, there are no data showing
differential use of wintering areas by breeding populations of
Swainson's hawks. We used stable-hydrogen isotope analysis of feathers
to determine whether large flocks of hawks wintering in Argentina
consisted of a mixture of individuals from across the North American
breeding range or consisted of individuals from discrete breeding
populations. We found that flocks of wintering Swainson's hawks
consisted of a mixture of individuals. The lack of connectivity between
populations of breeding and wintering hawks suggests that high wintering
mortality, either natural or human-induced, is unlikely to have direct
consequences on a single breeding area in North America. The demographic
effects of winter mortality should be 'diluted' across the entire
breeding range of Swainson's hawks.

"./data/WOS2011/uruguay.txt","Parasitism is the most common consumer strategy among organisms, yet
only recently has there been a call for the inclusion of infectious
disease agents in food webs. The value of this effort hinges on whether
parasites affect food-web properties. Increasing evidence suggests that
parasites have the potential to uniquely alter food-web topology in
terms of chain length, connectance and robustness. In addition,
parasites might affect food-web stability, interaction strength and
energy flow. Food-web structure also affects infectious disease dynamics
because parasites depend on the ecological networks in which they live.
Empirically, incorporating parasites into food webs is straightforward.
We may start with existing food webs and add parasites as nodes, or we
may try to build food webs around systems for which we already have a
good understanding of infectious processes. In the future, perhaps
researchers will add parasites while they construct food webs. Less
clear is how food-web theory can accommodate parasites. This is a deep
and central problem in theoretical biology and applied mathematics. For
instance, is representing parasites with complex life cycles as a single
node equivalent to representing other species with ontogenetic niche
shifts as a single node? Can parasitism fit into fundamental frameworks
such as the niche model? Can we integrate infectious disease models into
the emerging field of dynamic food-web modelling? Future progress will
benefit from interdisciplinary collaborations between ecologists and
infectious disease biologists.

"./data/WOS2011/uruguay.txt","We analysed the distribution patterns of megabenthic species of marine
molluscs from the Uruguayan shelf in relation to 3 interacting
gradients, namely depth, salinity and temperature of sea bottom waters.
Our results were generated from a data set comprising the complete list
of megabenthic gastropods (adult shell length > 50 mm; 22 species) from
a study area that encompassed latitudes from 34 to 39 degrees south,
between 4 and 800 m depth. Multiple regressions were used to evaluate
the contribution of 3 classes of explanatory variables to gastropod
richness at sampling points along the gradients: (1) geometric
constraints on the distribution of species' tolerance ranges for
environmental variables (the mid-domain effect, MDE), (2) the
species-area effect driven by the spatial extent of scaled environmental
variables, and (3) the environmental variables themselves. In addition,
we explored multivariate explanations for the bathymetric pattern of
gastropod species richness, incorporating depth-based area, temperature,
salinity and geometric constraints as predictor variables. Examination
of Moran's I for regression residuals confirmed that results were not
biased by spatial autocorrelation. Overall, the environmental variables
per se were the most important contributors to the observed patterns.
However, a significant signature of the MDE was revealed, by the entry
of geometric constraints into nearly all models. In contrast, the
species-area effect was less important. These results suggest that: (1)
MDE may operate in any kind of bounded gradient, (2) both stochastic and
deterministic processes are responsible for the pattern observed, and
(3) the relative contribution of the MDE to the patterns is dependent on
the gradient considered and the way in which species richness is
measured.

Rocha, a temporally open coastal lagoon in the Southwest Atlantic,
characterised by spatial gradients in salinity, nutrient levels and
trophic status. Carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes of main producers,
invertebrate and vertebrate consumers, and stomach contents of
ichthyofauna were analysed seasonally at freshwater (north) and
marine-influenced (south) sites to determine whether environmental
differences induced changes in food web structure. Contribution of
primary and secondary food sources and trophic linkages were assessed
with the multisource-partitioning model IsoSource and an index that
quantifies the contribution of each organism as food for the ecosystem.
Isotopic analyses were performed for 10 primary organic matter sources
(OM), 13 invertebrates and 9 fish species. Suspended and sediment OM
constituted the most important primary sources, while direct consumption
of macrophytes and macroalgae was marginal. The small invertebrates
Neomysis americana, Nephtys fluviatilis, Pseudodiaptomus richardii and
an amphipod were the most important intermediate consumers at both sites
(except F richardii, which was present only in the north). Top predators
were the fish species Micropogonias furnieri, Paralichthys orbygnianus
and Hoplias malabaricus, and the maximum estimated trophic level
(between 3.4 and 4.8) varied seasonally, but not between sites. Fish
stomach content analyses largely confirmed results from the IsoSource
mixing model. Overall results indicated that, despite environmental
differences between sites, the structure of the biological assemblages
and general trophic patterns were similar at both sites.

"./data/WOS2011/uruguay.txt","Recognizing the relationships between oceanographic variables and
population descriptors has been a major step in understanding
geographical range limits. In the present study, we investigate which
oceanographic features are responsible for the decrease in fitness and
consequent northern limit of the scallop Psychrochlamys patagonica
distribution in Uruguayan waters of the SW Atlantic Ocean (SAO), based
on information compiled from fishing and oceanographic surveys. P.
patagonica showed clear population responses to physical variables,
including 4 marked decrease in abundance, individual size and muscle
weight towards the northern edge of the range. A generalized additive
model (GAM) significantly explained 78.7% of the deviance in scallop
abundance and retained all 4 descriptors in the model as significant,
showing a decrease in abundance at lower latitudes with higher
temperature and at lower values of chl a and water depth. The
performance of GAMs was compared with that of the equivalent generalized
linear models (GLMs) and it was concluded that the extended flexibility
offered by GAMs resulted in better overall fits. Spatial variations in
scallop abundance were accurately predicted by the GAM, including the 2
peaks at latitudes 36 degrees 20'S and 36 degrees 50'S. These spatial
variations were closely related to the shelf break front around the 100
m isobath, where abundance was higher. The northern range limit of the
species in the SAO may be caused by a sharp decrease in habitat quality,
indicated by temperatures higher than 9 degrees C (above species
tolerance limit) associated with the influence of the Subtropical Water.
Whereas physiological tolerance to temperature appears to be an
important mechanism driving the range boundary of P. patagonica, food
availability (reflected by the highest concentrations in chl a) is a key
explanatory factor of the spatial variations in scallop abundance.

"./data/WOS2011/uruguay.txt","Sexual selection theory predicts that a higher investment in offspring
will turn females into the selective sex, while males will compete for
accessing and courting them. However, there are exceptions to the rule.
When males present a high reproductive investment, sex roles can reverse
from typical patterns, turning males into the choosy sex, while females
locate males and initiate courtship. In many spiders, males are smaller
than females, wandering in search of sedentary females and maximizing
the number of copulations. In the present study, we present findings on
the sand-dwelling wolf spider, Allocosa brasiliensis, evidencing a
reversal in typical courtship roles reported for the first time in
spiders. Males were bigger than females. Females located males and
initiated courtship. Copulation always occurred in male burrows and took
place mainly in long burrows. Males donated their burrows to the females
after copulation, closing the entrance before leaving with female
cooperation from inside. Males would provide females with a secure place
for ovipositing, being exposed to predation and diminishing their future
mating possibilities until constructing a new burrow. The cost of
vacating the burrow and losing the refuge in an unpredictable habitat,
such as sand dunes, would explain the courtship roles reversal in this
spider species. Results turn A. brasiliensis as a promising model for
discussing the determinants of sex roles and the pressures that drive
their evolution and maintenance.

"./data/WOS2011/uruguay.txt","Sandy beaches line most of the world's oceans and are highly valued by
society: more people use sandy beaches than any other type of shore.
While the economic and social values of beaches are generally regarded
as paramount, sandy shores also have special ecological features and
contain a distinctive biodiversity that is generally not recognized.
These unique ecosystems are facing escalating anthropogenic pressures,
chiefly from rapacious coastal development, direct human uses - mainly
associated with recreation - and rising sea levels. Beaches are
increasingly becoming trapped in a 'coastal squeeze' between burgeoning
human populations from the land and the effects of global climate change
from the sea. Society's interventions (e.g. shoreline armouring, beach
nourishment) to combat changes in beach environments, such as erosion
and shoreline retreat, can result in severe ecological impacts and loss
of biodiversity at local scales, but are predicted also to have
cumulative large-scale consequences worldwide. Because of the scale of
this problem, the continued existence of beaches as functional
ecosystems is likely to depend on direct conservation efforts.
Conservation, in turn, will have to increasingly draw on a consolidated
body of ecological theory for these ecosystems. Although this body of
theory has yet to be fully developed, we identify here a number of
critical research directions that are required to progress coastal
management and conservation of sandy beach ecosystems.

"./data/WOS2011/uruguay.txt","Shallow lakes, the most abundant lake type in the world, are very
sensitive to climatic changes. The structure and functioning of shallow
lakes are greatly impacted by submerged plants, and these may be
affected by climate warming in various, contrasting, ways.
Following a space-for-time substitution approach, we aimed to analyse
the role of aquatic (submerged and free-floating) plants in shallow
lakes under warm climates. We introduced artificial submerged and
free-floating plant beds in five comparable lakes located in the
temperate zone (Denmark, 55-57 degrees N) and in the subtropical zone
(Uruguay, 30-35 degrees S), with the aim to study the structure and
dynamics of the main associated communities.
Regardless of differences in environmental variables, such as area,
water transparency and nutrient status, we found consistent patterns in
littoral community dynamics and structure (i.e. densities and
composition of fish, zooplankton, macroinvertebrates, and periphyton)
within, but substantial differences between, the two regions.
Subtropical fish communities within the macrophyte beds exhibited higher
diversity, higher density, smaller size, lower relative abundance of
potentially piscivores, and a preference for submerged plants, compared
with otherwise similar temperate lakes. By contrast, macroinvertebrates
and cladocerans had higher taxon richness and densities, and periphyton
higher biomass, in the temperate lakes. Several indicators suggest that
the fish predation pressure was much stronger among the plants in the
subtropical lakes. The antipredator behaviour of cladocerans also
differed significantly between climate zones. Submerged and
free-floating plants exerted different effects on the spatial
distribution of the main communities, the effects differing between the
climate zones. In the temperate lakes, submerged plants promoted trophic
interactions with potentially positive cascading effects on water
transparency, in contrast to the free-floating plants, and in strong
contrast to the findings in the subtropical lakes.
The higher impact of fish may result in higher sensitivity of warm lakes
to external changes (e.g. increase in nutrient loading or water level
changes). The current process of warming, particularly in temperate
lakes, may entail an increased sensitivity to eutrophication, and a
threat to the high diversity, clear water state.

"./data/WOS2011/uruguay.txt","Understanding the factors that constrain and drive changes in food chain
length represents an open challenge in ecology. Although several
explanatory hypotheses have been proposed, no synthesis has yet been
achieved. The role of body size has been well-studied in recent years
because the hierarchy of trophic connections - in which large animals
consume small ones - suggests a positive relationship between trophic
position and body size. Empirical evidence, however, supports the
existence of both positive and negative associations, and some studies
have even reported no significant relationship between trophic position
and body size. These results suggest that the relationship may be
non-monotonic and driven by several interacting mechanisms. Here, we
analyze the effects of energetic limitations and structural constraints
on species' trophic positions. We show that the trophic position of
small-bodied animals can be limited by their ability to consume large
prey, whereas energetic limitations strongly constrain trophic positions
for large-bodied animals, with the intensity of this constraint
depending on the amount of energy available to top predators. These
differences in limiting mechanisms can account for the observed
variability in the association between the trophic position of top
predators and size. Furthermore, our derivation makes use of the
Metabolic theory of ecology and predicts a negative relationship between
temperature and the maximum achievable food chain length, providing a
mechanistic foundation for the observed reductions in food chain length
with temperature.

fluctuations in climate during the Pleistocene has direct implications
for predicting the impact of current climate change in the North. An
increasing number of phylogeographical studies in the Arctic have laid a
framework for testing hypotheses concerning the impact of shifting
environmental conditions on transcontinental movement. We review 35
phylogeographical studies of trans-Beringian terrestrial and freshwater
taxa, both hosts and parasites, to identify generalized patterns
regarding the number, direction and timing of trans-continental

from Asia to North America, with many events occurring in the Quaternary
period. The 35 molecular studies of trans-Beringian organisms we
examined focused primarily on the role of glacial cycles and refugia in
promoting diversification. We address the value of establishing testable
hypotheses related to high-latitude biogeography. We then discuss future
prospects in Beringia related to coalescent theory, palaeoecology,
ancient DNA and synthetic studies of arctic host-parasite assemblages
highlighting their cryptic diversity, biogeography and response to

"./data/WOS2011/uruguay.txt","Aim To analyse the current geographical structure of chloroplast DNA
variation in the Turnera sidoides L. complex in order to establish
historical biogeographical hypotheses for the mid-latitude South
American lowlands. During the Quaternary, the climate shifted from
tropical humid to cold dry, and the vegetation cover has not been
stable. The consequences of these processes on the current distribution
of the vegetation of this area have received very little attention.
Location The mid-latitude South American lowlands extend between c. 20
and 40 degrees S and include Uruguay, northern, central and eastern
Argentina, southern Brazil, and parts of southern Paraguay and Bolivia.
They are surrounded by higher-elevation systems.
Methods Turnera sidoides is a well-studied polyploid complex of
perennial rhizomatous herbs occurring throughout the area of interest.
We analysed 321 individuals from 79 populations of the five recognized
subspecies. We also included progenies from artificial crosses in order
to analyse chloroplast inheritance. After screening sequences for four
non-coding chloroplast DNA regions, the trnL-trnF spacer was selected to
characterize the collection.
Results Three haplotypes can be easily identified, with each differing
from the others in two independent characters. A clear geographic
structure is revealed when haplotypes are plotted for the complex as a
whole regardless of subspecies and cytotype. Three distinct regions can
be identified.
Main Conclusions We propose three putative refugial areas for the
Turnera sidoides complex, which are associated with the orographical
systems of the region. Ravines and slopes in the Haedo Cuchilla system
in northern Uruguay, the elevations of the western side of the area in
Argentina, and the eastern Serranias system in south-eastern Uruguay may
each have served as refugia in which the A, B and C haplotypes became
fixed during the drier climatic phases. Biogeographical patterns in the
area covered by T. sidoides, particularly east of the Uruguay River,
have not previously been analysed from a historical perspective.

"./data/WOS2011/uruguay.txt","Mated females of the wolf spider Schizocosa malitiosa are frequently
refractory to further copulations. Copulation consists of two successive
behavioural patterns: pattern I (PI) and pattern II (PII). During PI
males make multiple consecutive insertions with each palp, and in PII
males alternate the use of palps after each insertion until dismounting.
As both patterns are inseminatory, another function - such as generating
female reluctance - is suggested for this complex behaviour. Here we
test experimentally whether female spiders mated only with PI, or only
with PII, are reluctant to re-mate. Each copulating male was interrupted
immediately after the end of PI (phase A), and the same male was
instantly exposed to a second virgin female. After re-mounting, the male
initially performed a brief recapitulation of PI followed by PII (both
together considered as phase B). For testing female sexual reluctance,
females were exposed to a second male 3 days after the partial mating,
but whenever the mounting occurred it was interrupted. Females were
raised and progeny was counted. Phase-A-mated females were more
reluctant to re-mating than phase-B-mated females, but their respective
progeny was similar. We suggest that female reluctance is caused by
sperm-associated substances transferred during PI.

"./data/WOS2011/uruguay.txt","We evaluated the patterns of larval settlement of Carcinus maenas on
natural substratum and its relationships with forcing factors related to
larval transport mechanisms, Settlement was estimated as colonisation of
traps containing defaunated substratum. Traps were deployed at low tide
for 24 to 26 h, in the intertidal of the island of Helgoland (North Sea,
German Bight), every day during the settlement seasons of 2003 to 2005.
The forcing factors were wind direction, predicted residual surface (0
to 8 m) currents, and days since spring tide. The settlement season
lasted from the end of June to the end of August; colonisation rates
varied among and within years, without a clear pattern. In 2003 and
2004, long periods of low colonisation rates occurred in association
with strong and persistent (5 to 10 d) SW winds and eastward currents.
In 2003, colonisation peaked at spring tide only when winds were not
from SW and currents were not flowing eastwards. In 2005, colonisation
rates peaked mainly at, or 1 to 3 d after, spring tide; periods of low
colonisation were short, except at the end of the settlement season.
According to an existing 2-step model and to local movement of
megalopae, colonisation patterns in the intertidal may reflect transport
processes: (1) settlement rates on Helgoland are primarily affected by
wind-driven currents: SW winds transport larvae out of Helgoland waters,
leading to low settlement rates, while other wind regimes transport them
towards Helgoland. In the absence of strong SW winds, peaks of
settlement at or after spring tide suggest (2) selective tidal stream
transport or some form of tidally mediated flow. The absence of SW winds
leads to a higher influence of local movement of megalopae, as the
number of larvae reaching the benthic habitat is high. In consequence,
colonisation of natural substratum may reflect larval transport
processes and local movement of larvae in C. maenas and other
invertebrates with mobile benthic stages.

"./data/WOS2011/uruguay.txt","In short-lived mammals, age at maturity is a particularly important
parameter influencing lifetime fitness. Age at maturity proves highly
variable in altricial rodents, but little is known for small precocial
rodents of the order Caviomorpha. Even though extreme precociality
implies early maturation, female cavies and guinea-pigs (genus Cavia)
advance puberty considerably in the presence of males. We briefly review
earlier findings and compare them to data from altricial rodents. We
report experiments on 2 very similar species of cavy, the dark-backed
(C. magna) and the wild cavy (C. aperea). In the dark-backed cavy, we
tested whether the male signal responsible for acceleration of maturity
is a chemical in urine, as demonstrated for mice. Females exposed twice
daily to male urine on their nares matured at the same age (73-75 d) and
mass (around 330 g, 4 times birth mass) as females treated with water.
Thus, chemicals in urine did not replace the effect of male presence.
Two experiments with wild cavies showed that male presence without
physical contact was sufficient to accelerate puberty, even though
physical interaction leads to even earlier maturation. Presence of a
male during the first 10 d of life only did not lead to advanced
maturation in young females. Functionally, it may be more correct to
speak of a delay in the onset of maturity in the absence of males rather
than considering male presence to stimulate early maturation.
Comparative evidence suggests that precocial species generally mature
earlier than altricials.

"./data/WOS2011/uruguay.txt","The crowned eagle Harpyhaliaetus coronatus is a large Neotropical eagle
categorized as Endangered throughout its range. However, the threats to
this species are poorly understood. We present data on the causes of
death of crowned eagles in semi-arid forests of La Pampa province,
central Argentina. Data was obtained from field surveys and from
interviews with 62 local landowners during 1999-2004. Over this period
five eagles were shot, one killed by a car, one was found dead in a
cattle water trough, and one was found in captivity. From the interviews
information was obtained about a further 10 cases of eagles being shot,
disturbed or trapped. Five (13%) of 38 interviewed landowners who
positively identified the species admitted having killed or disturbed
eagles in the past but only two (5%) mentioned predation of eagles upon
livestock as a problem. Persecution seems to be a significant threat to
this species in central Argentina and future research and conservation
action should be focused not only on gaining a better knowledge of the
biology of the species but also on conservation and educational
programmes involving local people.

"./data/WOS2011/uruguay.txt","Pelagic longlines are widely known to interact with several species of
sea turtles, and there is an increasing concern about the by-catch of
turtles in commercial fisheries and its impact on their populations.
However, information on sea turtle by-catch in the South Atlantic Ocean
is scarce, and there are no quantitative by-catch data available on
olive ridleys for the Equatorial Eastern Atlantic. In this paper we
analyze data collected by observers on board an Uruguayan long-liner
targeting swordfish in two areas in the Equatorial Eastern Atlantic: off
the Gulf of Guinea and north of Saint Helenaa Island. Specimens of
Lepidochelys oliuacea and Dermochelys cariacea were hooked or entangled
in 26 longline sets. All registered interactions with olive ridleys took
place off the The Gulf of Guinea, with captures ranging from 1 to 3
specimens in a single set. The captured specimens, though not measured
directly, appeared to be juveniles. In addition, the examination of the
stomach contents of one female mako shark showed dermal scutes,
vertebrae and the complete head of a sea turtle identified as L.
olivacea, allowing us to estimate its curved carapace length. In
contrast, adult specimens of D. coriacea were caught in the two fishing
areas. The capture of 10 individuals in a single set was recorded. Due
to the high rate of sea turtle by-catch observed off the The Gulf of
Guinea (1.02 ind/1000 hooks) conservation programs in the area should
take into consideration the possible existence of a developmental and
feeding area in this zone. Accordingly, longline fisheries in this area
should be monitored and mitigation measures put in place to avoid or
minimize damage to the pelagic phase of African populations of sea
turtles. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

"./data/WOS2011/uruguay.txt","Question: What are the changes in vegetation structure, soil attributes
and mesofauna associated with grazing in mesic grasslands?
Location: Southern Campos of the Rio de la Plata grasslands, in
south-central Uruguay.
Methods: We surveyed seven continuously grazed and ungrazed paired
plots. Plant and litter cover were recorded on three 5-m interception
lines placed parallel to the fence in each plot. We extracted soil fauna
from a 10 ern deep composite sample and analysed the oribatids. Soil
attributes included bulk density, water content, organic carbon (in
particulate and mineral associated organic matter) and nitrogen content
and root biomass at different depths. Changes in floristic, Plant
Functional Types and mesofauna composition were analysed by Non-metric
Multidimensional Scaling.
Results: Species number was lower in ungrazed than in grazed plots. Of
105 species in grazed plots only three were exotics. Shrub and litter
cover were significantly higher inside the exclosures, while the cover
of Cyperaceae-Juncaceae was lower. Grazing treatments differed
significantly in plant and oribatid species composition. Grazing
exclusion significantly reduced soil bulk density and increased soil
water content. Carbon content in particulate organic matter was lower in
the upper soil of ungrazed sites, but deeper in the profile, grazing
exclosures had 8% more carbon in the mineral associated organic matter.
Conclusions: Our results generally agree with previous studies but
deviate from the results of previous analyses in (1) the increase of
shrub cover in ungrazed sites; (2) the redistribution of the soil
organic carbon in the profile and (3) the low invasibility of the
prairies regardless of grazing regime.

"./data/WOS2011/uruguay.txt","Aim To produce an inventory of south-west Atlantic saltmarshes (from
latitude 31 degrees 48' S to 43 degrees 20' S) using remotely sensed
images and field sampling; to quantify their total area; to describe the
biogeographical variation of the main habitats characterized by dominant
vascular plants, in relation to major environmental factors; to test the
hypothesis of predominance of the reversal pattern in plant distribution
(sedges and grasses dominate the lower, regularly inundated zones, while
the upper zones are occupied by more halophytic species) previously
described; and to compare these south-west Atlantic saltmarshes with
others world-wide.
Location South-western Atlantic saltmarshes
Methods Field samples of dominant emergent plant species positioned by
the global positioning system (GPS) were obtained from most coastal
saltmarshes (14) between southern Brazil and northern Patagonia,
Argentina. Landsat satellite images were obtained and coastal saltmarsh
habitats were quantified by supervised classification, utilizing points
gathered in the field.
Results Three main plant species dominated the low and middle intertidal
saltmarsh, Spartina alterniflora Loesel., Spartina densiflora Brong. and
Sarcocornia perennis (P. Mill.) A.J. Scott. The total area of the
studied coastal saltmarshes was 2133 km(2), comprising 380 km(2) of Sp.
alterniflora marsh, 366 km(2) of Sp. densiflora marsh, 746 km(2) of Sar.
perennis marsh and 641 km(2) of brackish marsh (dominated by Juncus
acutus L., Juncus kraussii Hochst., Scirpus maritimus L., Scirpus
americanus Pers. and Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin.). Cluster
analysis showed three habitat types: saltmarshes dominated by (1) Sp.
densiflora and brackish species,(2) Sp. alterniflora and Sar. perennis
and (3) Sp.densiflora only. The analysis of abiotic variables showed
significant differences between groups of habitats and coordinated
gradients of the abiotic variables. The south-west Atlantic coast showed
decreasing mean annual rainfall (1200 to 196 mm) and increasing mean
tidal amplitude (< 0.5 to > 2.5 m) from latitude 31 degrees to 43
degrees.
Main conclusions South-west Atlantic saltmarshes are globally important
by virtue of their total extent. Remote sensing showed that the reversal
pattern in plant distribution is not widespread. Indeed, south-west
Atlantic saltmarshes are better characterized by the presence of the
halophytic genera Spartina and Sarcocornia. Our results support the
interpretation that south-west Atlantic saltmarshes constitute a class
of temperate type (sensu Adam, 1990) with transitional characteristics
between Australasian-South African saltmarshes and west Atlantic
saltmarshes.

Acartia clausi from different biogeographic areas (northern and southern

temperatures (10, 15 and 18 degrees C) at saturating food conditions.
The relationship between development time and temperature was
established by fitting Belehradek's function. The northern population
had a shorter generation time at all temperatures. At 10 degrees C, the
development time was estimated to be 33.9 and 36.4 d decreasing to 16.3

respectively. Prosome length decreased with temperature, and the
southern population had longer individuals at all temperatures. ANCOVA
revealed a significant (p < 0.001) positive effect of temperature on the
growth rates, and nauplii grew faster than copepodites (except at 18
degrees C in the southern population and 20 degrees C in the northern
population). Significant differences between populations were noted
during larval growth, with nauplii from the north growing faster at high

(EHS) in Acartia tonsa and A. clausi over a wide salinity range (2 to 33
and 16 to 33, respectively). For A. tonsa, the energy partitioning
between ingestion, production and respiration was relatively constant
with small differences in gross growth efficiency (GGE) and cost of
growth (CG). In contrast, A. clausi exhibited significantly reduced
ingestion and GGE, and highly elevated CG at salinities <= 20. In both

both species, but decreased by 80% for A. clausi at 16. These results
contribute to the understanding of distribution patterns of both species

dominance of A. tonsa at low salinities, although its higher energetic
requirement and feeding activity subject it to stronger predation
pressure than competing A. clausi.

"./data/WOS2011/uruguay.txt","We studied the succession patterns of the benthic community following a
whole-lake restoration experiment in a subtropical hypertrophic lake
(Lake Rodo, 34 degrees 55' S 56 degrees 10' W, Montevideo, Uruguay). The
restoration measures involved diversion of the main inlet and removal of
upper 1-m sediment and biomanipulation of the fish community. Between
January 1997 and November 1999, we sampled sediments seasonally to
analyse changes in benthos in relation to other abiotic and biotic
characteristics of the system. The benthic community of the lake was
composed of three families and nine genera. The maximum density (646 ind
m(-2)), as well as the maximum taxonomic richness (six), were observed 1
month after the lake was refilled. Since 1998, the benthic abundance
decreased considerably and continuously and a total absence of benthic
organisms was registered by the end of the year. The low abundance of
macroinvertebrates during 1997 could be explained by the food
preferences of the dominant fish species, and the high fish biomass at
the beginning of the biomanipulation process. However, the most relevant
physico-chemical temporal patterns were the increase of organic matter
and nutrients in the sediment and the fluctuations of oxygen and nitrate
in the deepest layer of the water column. The disappearance of benthos
was related to these temporal changes. These results stress the
importance of the increase of organic matter for the changes in the
physicochemical environment, and its importance in the benthic
succession and possible collapse. We suggest that in hypertrophic lakes,
the effects of organic matter enrichment in the sediment can be even
more relevant than fish predation in shaping the zoobenthos.

"./data/WOS2011/uruguay.txt","The growth of isolated species can be described by simple laws but the
fate of ecosystems, where several species interact, is difficult to
predict. A crucial point seems to be the identification of regularities
in the species interaction patterns that determine the fate of
ecosystems. We approach this problem by using an ecosystem of three
species whose populations are governed by generalized Lotka-Volterra
differential equations. In our model, the species undergo both
inter-specific and intra-specific interactions. The inter-specific
interactions are positive, null or negative and are parameterized by
interaction coefficients epsilon(ij) which take values: +1, 0 and -1,
respectively. In these conditions, 138 different patterns of
interactions (up to species re-labeling) are possible. Two extreme cases
for the three intra-specific interactions (self-interactions) are
considered: epsilon(ii) = -1 and epsilon(ii) = 0. We also define derived
parameters, calculated from the interaction coefficients, which are
relevant to determine the survival of species. Comparison of particular
patterns shows that the relationship between interaction structure and
survival can be subtle and, a priori, unexpected. For instance, we found
that adding a negative interaction to a given pattern may be
detrimental, indifferent or even beneficial. The same may happen when
adding a positive interaction. To make a systematic study of the
relationship between structure and fate, first, we perform a
""microscopic"" study based on the analysis of individual patterns. As a
result, we obtained certain general rules or ""theorems"" concerning the
extreme cases of coexistence and extinction of the three species.
Second, in order to cover intermediate cases, where precise rules could
not be found, we performed ""statistical"" studies. These provide the
probability of survival and coexistence of species as a function of the
values of the interaction derived parameters. Among other results, we
found that reciprocal cyclic structures, of both positive and negative
interactions, and evenly distributed sign balances of input interactions
to the species appear to favor survival and coexistence. (c) 2004

realistic food levels (100 mu g C l(-1)) of 7 algae. Feeding was maximum
(ca. 20 ml ind.(-1) d(-1)) with Thalassiosira weissflogii and minimum

contrasting effects on EPR and EFIS (T weissflogii and P. minimum)

fairly stable for most single and mixed diets (range 12.3 to 17.3

low EFIS with enhanced feeding and EPR, and consequently lower
population growth efficiency. That represents a strategy with a high

"./data/WOS2011/uruguay.txt","Understanding the relationships between beach morphodynamics and
descriptors of macrofauna assemblages has been a major step in
theoretical development in sandy beach ecology. However, the role of
morphodynamics in shaping life-history traits is still uncertain. Here,
we test the predictions of the habitat harshness hypothesis (HHH) on the
life-history traits of the sandhopper Atlantorchestoidea brasiliensis,
based on information compiled from 7 Uruguayan sandy beaches spanning a
continuum from reflective to dissipative states, over a period of almost
2 yr. A. brasiliensis showed clear population responses to physical
variables in a trend opposite to that predicted by the HHH, including an
increase in abundance (total, ovigerous females and juveniles) and
individual sizes from dissipative to reflective beaches. A generalized
additive model explained 46.1 % of the deviance in sandhopper abundance
and retained all 4 physical descriptors in the model as significant.
Sandhopper abundance increased with grain size and beach face slope, and
decreased with low values of water content and compaction of the sand.
Per capita rate of recruitment increased linearly with adult abundance,
i.e. there was a positive density-dependent effect of adults on
recruitment rates, which exponentially decreased from reflective to
dissipative beaches. Only the proportion of ovigerous females increased
towards the dissipative domain. We conclude that the HHH did not
accurately predict spatio-temporal fluctuations in population features
of A. brasiliensis, particularly because of a limited appreciation of
the role played by life-history strategies in explaining population
responses to the environment. Our results have important implications
for sandy beach macrofauna, particularly supralittoral organisms, and
suggest a novel hypothesis (termed here the 'hypothesis of habitat
safety'), which states that the combination of narrow swashes and steep
slopes makes reflective beaches a more stable and safer environment for
supralittoral species.

tooth morphology and relationships between larval length, mouth width

microplankton layer during daylight, and both preferred copepods and
nauplii, although the diet of D. laternatus was more diverse. As
expected, the diets of these species tended to overlap in periods and
areas where food was more abundant, but diets differed under conditions
of low food availability. The 50 to 100 mm size range dominated the size
spectrum. of ingested prey in both species. The smallest prey width was
constant for the entire range of larval sizes. The largest prey width
was variable both within and between species, and increased with larval
size. Regression analyses of mouth size and body length showed a
potential relationship in D laternatus and a linear relationship in T
mexicanus aff. oculeus. Prey ingested by D. laternatus were wider than
those ingested by T mexicanus all. oculeus at equal larval sizes. The
species presented differences in dentition patterns (hook-like teeth and
pharyngeal structures in D, laternatus, conical teeth in T mexicanus
aff. oculeus). Opportunistic feeding and the feeding characteristics of
both species should favor persistence and high abundances in the

"./data/WOS2011/uruguay.txt","Grasslands and their grazers provide some of the most compelling
examples for studying the relationship between diversity, productivity,
and disturbance. In this study, we analyzed the impact of
grazing-induced changes in species composition and community structure
upon the productivity of a grassland in the Campos region, Uruguay. We
compared three treatments: a continuously grazed area, a 9-year old
exclosure to domestic herbivores, and grazing-simulated plots inside the
exclosure, which were clipped so that their standing biomass resembled
that of the grazed area. We studied the community composition of the
grazed and ungrazed situations, and determined biomass and above-ground
net primary production (ANPP) of the three treatments during 1 year.
Grazed plots had higher species richness and diversity than the
exclosure. Grazing resulted in the replacement of some cool-season,
tussock grasses by warm-season, prostrate grasses. ANPP was 51% higher
under grazing than in the exclosure, but the grazing-simulated plots
inside the exclosure were the most productive treatment, 29% higher than
the grazed plots. Thus, two components of grazing effect may be
postulated for this grassland. The structural component resulted in
higher ANPP, probably due to the elimination of standing dead biomass.
The species composition component resulted in lower ANPP once the
structural component was controlled, probably due to the shift to
warm-season phenology and prostrate habit. Our findings contrast with a
similar experiment carried out in the neighbouring Flooding Pampa
region, which suggests that the relationship between grazing and
community structure and function is difficult to generalize.

reaching frequencies between 58.4 and 86.7%. A null model suggests that
IGP in different groups of predators and prey (i.e. carnivores,

We suggest that IGP satisfies two basic requirements to be considered as

"./data/WOS2011/uruguay.txt","In marine benthic invertebrates with complex life cycles, recruitment
success, juvenile survival, and growth may be affected by variation in
both maternal factors and environmental conditions prevailing during
preceding embryonic or larval development. In an estuarine crab,
Chasmagnathus granulata, previous investigations have shown that initial
larval biomass is positively correlated with the biomass of recently
extruded eggs, and it depends also on the salinity experienced during
embryogenesis. Biomass at hatching has consequences for the subsequent
larval development which, in this species, comprises two alternative
developmental pathways with four or five zoeal instars (short or long
pathway) and a megalopa. Larvae hatching with a lower than average
biomass tend to develop through the long pathway and metamorphose to
megalopae with higher biomass. In the present study, we show
experimentally that the long pathway produces also significantly larger
juveniles (crab size measured as carapace width, biomass as dry mass,
carbon and nitrogen contents). Compared with juveniles originating from
the short pathway, those from the long pathway showed in successive
instars longer moulting cycles and larger carapace width, but lower size
increments at ecdysis. In consequence, differences in size or biomass of
long pathway vs short pathway crabs tended to disappear in later instars
(after stage V). Furthermore, we tested in juveniles the tolerance of
starvation at three salinities (5parts per thousand, 15parts per
thousand, 32parts per thousand). Tolerance of starvation was
significantly higher in juveniles originating from the long pathway,
indicating higher energy reserves. While salinity played only a minor
role for survival, it exerted significant effects on the time of
moulting to the second juvenile instar, regardless of the preceding
developmental pathway. The biomass of first juveniles obtained from the
short pathway showed a significant positive correlation with the biomass
of the freshly hatched zoea I, but not in those from the long pathway.
In conclusion, the fitness of juvenile C. granulata is linked with
previous developmental processes and environmental conditions during the
embryonic and larval phase. Hence, a better understanding and prediction
of the recruitment success of marine benthic invertebrates with a
complex life cycle may require more comprehensive life-history
investigations.

varied markedly within this range and exhibited systematic geographical
patterns of variation. Abundance significantly increased from temperate

of males. Conversely, length at maturity and asymptotic weight of
females increased from subtropical to temperate beaches, being inversely

temperate beaches to high-density subtropical beaches. The effect of
habitat quality and availability could explain discontinuities in the
species distribution within its range, and also differential responses
in life-history attributes at a local scale. Asymmetries and converse
latitudinal trends between sexes suggest that there is not a single
general factor determining large-scale patterns in life-history traits
of this species. Our results reinforce the view that density-dependent
and environmental factors operating together regulate sandy beach
populations. The need to develop macroecological studies in sandy beach
ecology is highlighted, as knowledge acquired from local to large
spatial scales throws light on population structure and regulation
mechanisms.

"./data/WOS2011/uruguay.txt","Present theory of marine community structure includes the effect of
environmental factors that act upon larval survival on distribution and
abundance of benthic adults, The theory assumes that pre-settlement
environmental factors produce a direct effect at the population level,
determining the abundance of individuals that enter the benthic habitat.
These are density effects that propagate from the larval to the benthic
phase (abbreviated here as DEMPHs). However, recent information suggests
that pre-settlement factors may also produce an effect on population
abundance, mediated by changes in traits of settlers. For instance,
larvae experiencing food stress may give rise to juveniles with reduced
energy reserves, growth rate, and in consequence with a low life
expectancy. Thus, such trait-mediated (e.g. life historical,
physiological) effects propagate through different life phases of the
complex life cycles of benthic invertebrates, ultimately affecting
juvenile survival. In this paper, I discuss the potential role of this
special kind of trait-mediated effect (abbreviated here as DELPHIs) on
benthic communities. I show that DELPHIs may affect the shape of the
stock-settlement function leading to an erroneous interpretation of the
role of post-settlement factors on benthic communities. Mortality due to
DELPHIs is the consequence of pre-settlement factors but may be
confounded with mortality due to post-settlement factors. In this
regard, I conclude that the only solution to avoid this error is to
incorporate measurements of traits of individuals in settlement and
recruitment studies. Besides, DELPHIs may allow for complex interactions
between pre- and post-settlement processes, suggesting that dichotomous
views about the role of pre- and post-settlement processes are not
appropriate. Finally, I suggest that future field research in benthic
communities should incorporate an estimation of DELPHIs as a tool to
expand, and thus improve, marine community theory.

"./data/WOS2011/uruguay.txt","In shallow temperate lakes many ecological processes depend on submerged
macrophytes. In subtropical and tropical lakes, free-floating
macrophytes may be equally or more important. We tested the hypothesis
that different macrophyte growth forms would be linked with different
bottom-up and top-down mechanisms in out-competing phytoplankton. We
compared experimentally the effects of submerged and free-floating
plants on water chemistry, phytoplankton biomass, zooplankton and fish
community structure in a shallow hypertrophic lake (Lake Rodo, 34degrees
55' S 56degrees10' W, Uruguay). Except for the retention of suspended
solids, we found no other significant bottom-up process connected with
either Eichhornia crassipes or Potamogeton pectinatus. Free-floating
plants had a lower abundance of medium-sized zooplankton than any other
microhabitat and submerged plants were apparently preferred by
microcrustaceans. Fish showed a differential habitat use according to
species, size-class and feeding habits. Dominant omnivore-planktivores,
particularly the smallest size classes, preferred submerged plants. In
contrast, omnivore-piscivores were significantly associated with
free-floating plants. The density of omnivorous-planktivorous fish, by
size class, significantly explained the distribution of medium-sized
zooplankton, the high number of size 0 fish being the main factor. The
abiotic environment and the structure of the zooplankton community
explained little of the fish distribution pattern. Our results suggest
that bottom-up effects of free-floating plants are weak when cover is
low or intermediate. Top-down effects are complex, as effects on
zooplankton and fish communities seem contradictory. The low piscivores:
planktivores ratio in all microhabitats suggests, however, that
cascading effects on phytoplankton through free-floating plant impacts
on piscivorous fish are unlikely to be strong.

and forbs) in natural grasslands of Uruguay over a 9-yr period after the
removal of domestic herbivores. For the whole community, species
richness and diversity decreased over the successional period. In
graminoids we observed clear temporal trajectories in floristic
composition; the rate of floristic change decreased with time and was
associated with a shift in plant traits. The exclusion of large
herbivores promoted erect and tall grasses with narrow leaves and
greater seed length, vegetative growth constrained to the cool season
and increased frequency of annual species. Forbs did not show a clear
temporal trend in species composition, but there was, nevertheless, a
plot-specific species turnover of this functional group that was
reflected in their attributes. Species spreading by means of rhizomes,
with vegetative growth restricted to the warm season. Species with
larger seeds increased under grazing exclusion, as did annual and
nitrogen-fixing forbs. The floristic changes induced by cattle exclusion
occurred early in the succession. This early high rate of change has
practical implications for management and conservation programs of the
natural grasslands of Uruguay. Additionally, the shift in plant traits
may be helpful in devising simple indicators of grazing impact.

"./data/WOS2011/uruguay.txt","This study deals with the description, in field conditions, of the
oviposition preferences and mortality at the egg stage of the proposed
biocontrol agent Anacassis fuscata on its host plant, Baccharidastrum
triplinervium, in Southern Uruguay. Egg clusters were classified
according to their location on the adaxial or abaxial surface of annual
or seasonal leaves. The main tendencies were a very high preference for
the oviposition on annual compared with seasonal leaves, and a lack of
preference for the adaxial or the abaxial surfaces of the leaf. We
propose that this behavior has evolved to create a niche separation
between early stage larvae and conspecific adults. Temporal variations
in the ovipositing preferences were observed throughout the 2-mo
oviposition period, which can be related to changes in the phenology of
the host plant. Egg mortality was high in both years studied, and showed
variability. The highest incidence was found on the adaxial surface of
seasonal leaves, a finding that may be related with an observed low
preference for the oviposition on this site. Egg size was smaller in
Uruguay than in Argentina and Brazil, which might be explained by the
fact that in Uruguay the average number of eggs per cluster is higher.
Based on our observations that A. fuscata is a latent species, and that
intensive defoliation by larvae does not affect the viability of the
host plant, we conclude that even when A. fuscata has features that make
it a good candidate for the control of Baccharis and Baccharidastrum, it
is not an effective agent for biocontrol under field conditions.

"./data/WOS2011/uruguay.txt","In an experimental laboratory investigation on an estuarine crab,
Chasmagnathus granulata Dana, we investigated how salinities experienced
during embryonic and larval development (embryonic and larval salinity
exposures, respectively) and intraspecific variability of initial
biomass at egg laying and hatching affected larval performance. The
latter was measured in terms of survival rate, duration of development
through successive stages, frequency of occurrence of an additional
(fifth) zoeal stage, and size of the first juvenile instar. Ovigerous
female crabs were maintained at 3 salinities (15, 20, 32parts per
thousand). For each egg mass, biomass of freshly laid eggs and of
freshly hatched larvae, respectively, was measured as dry mass, carbon,
and nitrogen contents. After hatching, the larvae were reared at
salinities of 5, 10, 15, and 32parts per thousand. When larvae hatched
from eggs that had been incubated at reduced salinities (15 or 20parts
per thousand), their survival through the zoea I stage at low salinities
(5 and 10parts per thousand) was high and stage duration was short. By
contrast, poor survival and delayed development were observed in larvae
reared at low salinities when they hatched from eggs that had been
incubated in full-strength seawater (32parts per thousand). Larval
rearing in seawater allowed generally for highest survival and shortest
development. While the embryonic salinity exposure had a strong
influence on the performance of the first zoeal stage, later stages
showed no significant response to the previous conditions of egg
incubation. At advanced stages, low larval salinity exposure (15parts
per thousand) led to consistently lower survival, longer duration of
development, and higher proportion of larvae passing through an
additional zoeal instar. However, larger juveniles metamorphosed from
larvae that hatched from eggs incubated at low (15parts per thousand)
salinity. The initial biomass of eggs and larvae, which varied
significantly among broods produced by different females, was identified
as another-factor affecting larval performance. At constant 32parts per
thousand, larvae with high initial biomass showed higher survival and
faster development. Significantly more larvae developed through an
additional instar when they hatched with a low initial biomass. In
conclusion, our results show that the performance in a given phase of a
complex life-history depends not only on the present environmental
conditions but also on those prevailing in the preceding phase.
Moreover, intraspecific variability in maternal energy investment into
offspring production may play a significant role for the chances of
larval survival and development in the plankton.

photosynthetic rates in a shallow coastal lagoon with periodic exchange
with the Atlantic Ocean. In particular, we assessed whether the exchange

During events of marine intrusion, the UV attenuation coefficient (K-d)
in the brackish zone decreased up to 70% of the values observed under
the influence of the freshwater discharge. The highest inhibition of the
PAR-saturated photosynthetic rates by UV radiation (up to 55%) was
observed in summer at the brackish zone in association with marine

to 3-fold lower than in the brackish area due to higher K-d values in
the UV range. On average for the entire system, near-surface primary
production was reduced by ca. 25%, and the contribution by UV-A and UV-B

at a latitude where predicted trends in reduction of stratospheric ozone
are significant. However, hydrological changes affecting river discharge

"./data/WOS2011/uruguay.txt","Several studies have shown consistent macroinfauna community patterns in
sandy beaches that could be mainly explained by variations in physical
factors (i.e. grain size, beach slope, swash processes). However, the
macroecology of population dynamics and biogeographic patterns in life
history traits have not been adequately assessed in sandy beach ecology.
Here, we examine the latitudinal variation of population dynamics and
life history traits of the Sandy intertidal mole crab Emerita
brasiliensis in sandy beaches along the entire range of the species
distribution of some 2700 km of the Atlantic coast of South America.
Population structure by sex and size, individual growth, natural
mortality, and the length-fecundity and length-weight relationships were
compared. Most of the life history and population dynamics features of
Emerita brasiliensis show clear geographical patterns: (1) a shift from
continuous to seasonal reproductive and recruitment events from
subtropical to temperate sandy beaches; (2) an increase in the
individual size of the smallest ovigerous female and in the fecundity at
size (length-fecundity relationship) from subtropical to temperate
beaches; (3) a higher predominance of females towards temperate beaches;
(4) an increase in male sizes towards subtropical beaches, following a
direct relationship with mean water temperature of the surface zone; (5)
a significant correlation between female growth parameters (L-infinity =
inverse and K and phi' = direct) and surface water temperature; (6) an
increase in the individual weight at size (length-weight relationship)
from subtropical to temperate beaches, both for males and females; and
(7) a linear decrease in life span and an asymptotic increase in natural
mortality (both sexes) from temperate to subtropical beaches. The
additional effect of morphodynamics at a regional scale was also
detected, and in some cases masked or ameliorated clear latitudinal
trends. Populations on dissipative beaches had a more extended
reproductive season than in reflective beaches, as well as higher growth
performance, fecundity and somatic weight at size. The decreasing
occurrence of females in subtropical beaches might explain the
unexpected but consistently increasing male crab sizes towards lower
latitudes. This supports the hypothesis of asymmetric intraspecific
competition between sexes, which may be considered a critical regulating
process in sandy beach populations.

"./data/WOS2011/uruguay.txt","The grapsid crab Chasmagnathus granulata populates brackish-water
lagoons and other estuarine environments. In its reproduction, this
species follows a strategy of larval export, i.e. its larvae live under
different salinity conditions from the juveniles and adults. In the
present experimental investigation, ontogenetic changes in the
capability for osmoregulation were studied in all 4 zoeal stages, the
megalopa, the juvenile crab instars I, II and IV, and adults (all reared
in seawater, 32parts per thousand). Moreover, we studied effects of
embryonic and larval acclimation on osmoregulation, The zoea I larvae
were slight hyper-regulators at low salinities (10 to 17parts per
thousand) and hyper-osmoconformers at higher salinities. Stages II to IV
zoeae were generally hyper-osmoconformers. At metamorphosis to the
megalopa, the type of osmoregulation changed to hyper-hypo-regulation.
The osmoregulatory capacities under both hypo- and hypersaline
conditions increased strongly in the crab I and throughout later
juvenile development. These patterns in osmoregulation match the
ontogenetic changes that typically occur in the ecology of C. granulata:
the zoea I hatches in brackish estuarine waters, where the juveniles and
adults live, before it is exported to coastal marine zones. This initial
larval stage is euryhaline and capable of hyper-osmoregulation at low
salinities. The same capabilities were observed in the megalopa, which
re-invades the brackish adult environment. This stage is known to settle
in semiterrestrial habitats near the adult burrows, where both brackish
and hypersaline conditions are likely to occur; this coincides with the
first ontogenetic appearance of the hyper-hypo-osmoregulation pattern,
The zoeal stages II, III and IV, in contrast, develop in the adjacent
sea, where the salinity is higher and more stable. Correspondingly,
these intermediate larval stages were found to be stenohaline
osmoconformers. Preceding exposure of the eggs and larvae to a reduced
salinity (20parts per thousand) enhanced the hyper-osmoregulatory
capacity at low salinities (5 to 10parts per thousand) in all zoeal
stages. This indicates an effect of non-genetic acclimation and, hence,
phenotypic plasticity. This trait should have an adaptive value, as it
increases the chance of larval survival, at least in the initial larval
stage, which is in the field exposed to highly variable, mostly reduced
salinities.

trend for species richness of macroinvertebrates to decrease along a

This widely documented pattern remains unexplained, because the
responsible ecological factors and underlying biological processes are

significantly along the morphodynamic gradient, is the key limiting
factor underlying this biological pattern. In this study, I suggest that
2 other physical factors could also be involved: sediment grain size and
erosion-accretion dynamics. This proposal is supported by a 2 yr study
of 12 sandy beaches in Chile, which showed that grain size becomes
coarser, erosion-accretion dynamics more intense, and swash frequency
and velocity increase as morphodynamic conditions change from
dissipative to reflective extremes. I propose that these 3 environmental
factors, although physically interrelated, may have independent
influences on different biological processes or species. I suggest
therefore that the reduction of species towards the reflective extreme
is caused by increasing environmental severity, which is generated by
the action (of at least) the 3 physical factors mentioned above. This
proposal constitutes the hypothesis of 'multicausal environmental
severity', which agrees with the large interspecific variability in the
life history and ecological traits of sandy beach communities, since it
admits that species with different characteristics could be controlled
by different limiting factors. Thus, the present hypothesis provides a
more general and flexible framework for investigating the relationship
between species richness and morphodynamics in sandy beaches.

"./data/WOS2011/uruguay.txt","Exposed marine beaches are physically rigorous habitats in which
macrofauna community patterns have been well correlated with physical
factors such as grain size, beach slope and wave/swash processes. In
this context, the swash exclusion hypothesis (SEH) gained wide
acceptability in explaining the control of species abundance and
diversity of the sandy beach macrofauna by swash climate, determined by
wave height and beach face slope. This hypothesis predicts a consistent
increase in species richness, abundance and biomass from reflective to
dissipative conditions. However, predictions of the SEH have not been
adequately tested at a population level. Here, demographic and life
history characteristics of the intertidal mole crab Emerita brasiliensis
were compared between populations of 2 microtidal exposed sandy beaches
with contrasting morphodynamics during 22 consecutive months. The major
prediction of the paradigm does not hold for the mole crab: total
abundance, as well as that of males, females, males with spermatophores
and megalops did not differ between beaches. Moreover, the reflective
beach population presented higher male growth rates in size and lower
natural mortality. Other population processes and life history traits
gave support for the SEH: the dissipative beach population presented (1)
higher abundance of ovigerous females, female growth rates, fecundity,
egg production potential, size at maturity, as well as weight at size;
and (2) lower female mortality and burrowing rates (for both sexes). The
SEH seems to be particularly useful in explaining female somatic growth
and reproductive features, which could be related to a major amount of
food availability in dissipative beaches. However, other competing, but
not exclusive, hypotheses are needed to explain variations in population
abundance and other processes such as male growth and survivorship. The
empirical evidence from several recent studies on the Uruguayan coast
showed that sandy beach populations that co-occur in contrasting
environments are less sensitive to variations in beach morphodynamics,
which should not be considered the primary factor affecting the
abundance and some life history traits. The importance of alternative
population regulation processes and mechanisms are stressed.
